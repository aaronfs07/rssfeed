This vulnerability occurs in certain versions of PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF and enables an unauthenticated actor to execute malicious code remotely without credentials. PaperCut released a patch in March 2023.\nAccording to FBI observed information, malicious actors exploited CVE-2023-27350 beginning in mid-April 2023 and continuing through the present. In early May 2023, also according to FBI information, a group self-identifying as the Bl00dy Ransomware Gang attempted to exploit vulnerable PaperCut servers against the Education Facilities Subsector.\nThis joint advisory …",

To conduct operations using this tool, the FSB created a covert peer-to-peer (P2P) network of numerous Snake-infected computers worldwide. Many systems in this P2P network serve as relay nodes which route disguised operational traffic to and from Snake implants on the FSB’s ultimate targets. Snake’s custom communications protocols employ encryption and fragmentation for confidentiality and are designed to hamper detection and collection efforts.\nWe have identified Snake infrastructure in over 50 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australi…",

I want something like packet tracer do(or GNS3 but never used it before) to configure 802.1X on switch port, a windows server with NAPS->NPS fonctionnality, test wired and wireless login.\n I belive it's possible to do 802.1X on packet tracer but for the windows server configuration ? It's possible to create VM on packet tracer, or the 'graphical' interface on the computers is enough ?\n 2) Ok for local connection, what about VPN ? It's something I'm learning on my own but never install/configure one from now, is it difficult to link with RADIUS ?\n 3) For now I want to build my own classic RADIUS lab but I think I'm screwed to do it in entreprise... Because we have a hybrid/full cloud infrastructure in Azure AD. I think it's a total another lvl of difficulty . Does anyone know more about this ?\n I'm not alone in my entreprise, we have a provider to take care of network tasks et management but he is not often there and I don't dare to ask basic question :(\n I'm trying to be very proactive on the subject (it's for october so it's pretty soon I think), I will keep you up about this !\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/MrlyKing  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Note: the system this post refers to is on premise.\n I'm not a sysadmin, so I could be wrong about this, but it seems wrong to me that to RDP into the computers in the DMZ, I need to remember/maintain a local windows account for each computer in the DMZ (we have several dozen). These accounts' passwords also expire after a month, which makes managing the accounts even more difficult. I have searched the web for what is considered best practice, and I haven't been able to find anything I can understand. I've seen a few posts about Read Only Domain Controllers and Jump Servers, but as a non sysadmin, I'm having a hard time understanding these.\n Now that you understand my question, let me give you a brief explanation of our system.\n The system is entirely on prem. At the front, we have a load balancer with a public IP. This is what our customers connect to. Behind the load balancer, we have the DMZ. The DMZ contains a number of windows server VMs running IIS. Behind the DMZ, we have our AD network. This is where our application and database server are. It's also where the computers used by our staff are.\n As a user of the system, my computer is in the AD network. As I mentioned earlier, I sometimes need to RDP into a server in the DMZ. Ideally, I would just use my AD credentials to authenticate, but that doesn't work because the DMZ is not part of the AD network.\n So, could you please tell me if the best way to connect to the servers in the DMZ is via local windows accounts? Another thing I'd like to know is, is a DMZ even necessary? Why can't the load balancer just route to the appropriate computer in the AD network?\n    submitted by    /u/Personal-Drama-8446  \n [link]   [comments]",

As some mentioned, I tried to re-pitch my ideas using more business terms and to try to frame the proposal as more of a risk management type of thing. The CTO's response to that was that it's too high-level and she wants more details.\n So I tried again (for the 4th time) with the following 2 items :\n - buying an EDR solution and installing it on every endpoint to protect from ransomware and other viruses\n - buying Windows Pro for the laptops and Azure AD P1\n Both of these suggestions were again rejected because:\n a) they were not detailed enough and didn't show how the cost of the licenses would bring value to the company\n b) she claimed that we already have Azure AD. I had previously showed her that we have Azure AD Free which includes very few features and is certainly not enough to get where we want to go. Is she intentionally lying because she doesn't want to spend on a P1 license? did she not check the console to confirm what she said? It's not like this is a matter of opinion, she's just refusing to see what's there.\n So yeah, I tried again before giving up but at this point I just don't see why I would spend more time fighting with this person who clearly has no intention of helping me in my duties.\n Also note: I confirmed they're aiming for ISO 27001 certification - she said they previously had it in 2019 but it expired. Not sure how that's possible but I saw the certificate myself so it's true.\n EDIT: Just to clarify, the ISO certification is from 2018 and applies to software development and software products and services only. There was no surveillance audit done after the certification and it was not renewed.

Helpdesk plus, because they wanted me but my skillset was above helpdesk so they paid me a bit more and gave me more to do. 3 people, 100 employees, 200+ students.\n 2 years later the boss leaves for another state. Family reasons. my coworker and I absorb his job, he gets the hot seat and I take on the Sys admin roles and most user facing duties. We work more like a team then a boss/subordinate pairing and life is good, though a bit overworked. We're not just coworkers, were friends, and this makes life immensely more bearable.\n 3 years later I find myself locking his accounts and shutting down his keycards. Didn't have a great year and a lot of personal issue's. He left amicably, and there's no bitterness about it. it may be best for him to get a fresh start. A least thats what we decided the takeaway should be.\n But that leaves me, a one man shop. I know enough to keep the school running, but I dont even know who I answer to officially. They told me that I'll learn how to do the budget stuff for the department Monday, but they literally just had my \"Letter of Agreement\" renewal 20 minutes before they told my boss he was leaving and there was no discussion of a title change or a raise. Apparently, they've been talking to an MSP and some restructuring, but I've been told my job is secure.\n I'm still a bit numb and trying to process it all. I don't want to leave my job, I absolutely love where I am and what I do. but since everyone else rants on this sub about their job I figured I would pour some stress into the webs as well...

          "description": "I had a user yesterday receive a phishing email with a link to 'keep his password'. This email made it through our email filtering. It was sent by a legitimate business whose email address had been compromised. Our associate clicked this link which took them to a website mimicking a Microsoft login page. He typed his credentials in. At this point the malicious party had his credentials and attempted to sign into his account. The associate received the Microsoft Authenticator push notification. The push notification presented numbers that the party attempting to login would need to enter in order to gain access. This was new to the associate. He was used to the simple 'approve' or 'deny' buttons on the push notification. He admitted that they would have hit the 'approve' button if it would have been presented.\n In last month's meeting with executive management I explained the the CA policies we have in place for our 365 logins. Only 25% of our 365 accounts need to be able to connect from outside our facility (manufacturing), so we have a CA policy that prevents 75% of our accounts from connecting outside the facility. We also have a CA policy blocking connections from all countries other than USA, with an exception group we can temporarily add an associate's account to for international travel. We have a CA policy enforcing MFA for all logins and a CA policy that requires modern auth clients to use approved client apps and protection policies.\n During this meeting I explained that we would be rolling out Number Matching for our push notifications. I explained that the flaw in the push notification is that associates are so used to approval prompts on their cellphones, that the chances of them approving an illegitimate login is quite likely.\n It feels good to have that validation that you're not just talking crazy and that the scenarios you lay out actually can and will happen.\n    submitted by    /u/DoYouHaveASecond  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I understand, LAPS requires Group Policy refreshes and such to check-in or sync from time to time. Since we don't have VPN for end users to touch the DC's while offsite, I'm guessing that's part of the issue with the passwords not working.\n Am wondering if anyone has an alternative? Just need to run a CMD prompt as Admin on remote users laptops for installs, open Device Manager as Admin etc, nothing fancy.\n One thought is to write a system level service that's deployed on all laptops. The service can be invoked under the user context and get permission to run Admin level commands from some from of Azure authentication that doesn't require VPN or on-prem DC's. \n I'm willing to research and develop this, however just want to know if some existing solution is already out there. Not interested in packaging apps with Intune. Trying to make this simpler and 'just work'.\n What are your thoughts?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BlueInTune  \n [link]   [comments]",

These machines are installed all over the world, and they all have a Windows PC on board, so Teamviewer was an easy way for remote access/support.\n However we want to move away from Teamviewer for 2 reasons:\n - security : we don't want to use Teamviewer anymore, as it introduces a security risk in the customers network.\n - user friendliness: Teamviewer recently had a complete overhaul of it's UI. Nobody likes it anymore.\n So as a solution, we want to equip all our machines with a VPN gateway device (eg Ewon or IXON). That way, we can connect via VPN to our machine local network (much safer). Once that we are connected via VPN, we can use VNC to remotely control the machine PC.\n I just started evaluating the different VNC implementations (TightVNC, ultraVNC,...). However they have not changed since I've used them about twenty years ago.\n I am missing drag and drop support for file transfer and performance (fluent updates) is way worse than Teamviewer. I also checked out Windows Quick Assist, but this requires manual starting the connection at the customer side. We need an 'always on' server service so we can connect to the machine anytime.\n Does anybody has some suggestions for remote access that works (like VNC) only in a LAN (so no Teamviewer, Anydesk, Splashtop,...)\n Thx,\n Thomas.\n    submitted by    /u/Thomas_VDB  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello ! I'm doing a lot of learning in my own labs recently and I noticed something a bit odd.\n I set up banned word list on Azure AD. It includes, for example, all fruits and animals. I understand how the password strength is calculated behind the scenes so even with my word list, the following password is accepted on AAD: Hippopotamus!Raspberry!Chimpanzee!\n ​\n I installed the agent and proxy right on the DC of my VM lab. I check the Event Viewer logs to track what happens. \n However, this password above is not accepted. I guess it's because it has the banned words? \n So it gives me the impression that the Azure Password Protection agent does an exact match to the word list. If the password contains any of the banned words, then It's rejected. However, on AAD, I can change the password to Hippopotamus!Raspberry!Chimpanzee! and Writeback seems to set it on premises as well.\n I feel like I am not understanding something ... Is this the expected behaviour? Or perhaps the configuration is missing something? Is it failing because the default password policy on a fresh Server 2019 DC requires numbers as well?

I've started with the windows server proxies, as they have less components and I expected to be more easy.\n But, this is where things are getting crazy. When I remove any Windows server from the domain, when it reboots, it gets stuck with the previous user that logged on. If I'm smart enough to have logged on with the local administrator when removing the machine from the domain, at least I can log in. But if I forget that and use my domain account it get stuck after reboot. There is no option to switch to another user. Even if I log in with the administrator account and try to lock, sign out, switch account, any of that, it just doesn't work.\n What am I missing here? Is this the effect of the remains of some GPO of the domain?\n While researching I've come across two policies that could be affecting in that way, but it seems that they're not being applied, since the machine is not in the domain anymore.\n Interactive logon: Don't display last signed-in > Disabled\n Enumerate local users on domain-joined computers > Not Configured\n I've also tried cleaning the GPOS after leaving the domain, by running: RD /S /Q \"%WinDir%\\System32\\GroupPolicyUsers\" && RD /S /Q \"%WinDir%\\System32\\GroupPolicy\"\n By creating a new Windows Server VM, I can confirm that the normal, non-domain server have the switch user and also lists the local users, if it happens to have more than one.\n I don't know what else to check.\n I'm including screenshots from two servers, one that have leaved the domain, and one fresh install, non-domain. https://imgur.com/a/sS5R6XG\n    submitted by    /u/paganois  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since it's supposed to be Read Only Friday today, I think it's a good watch IMO for all WinAdmins. Might not all be implemented in Windows 11 but it's their goal.\n A few key things mentioned;\n  \nEnforcing code signing for apps in Windows by default, with opt-out options. \n \nBy default, completely blocking script files (PS1, BAT etc) that were downloaded from the internet and other permission limitations. \n \nApp control designed to avoid 'dialogue fatigue' like what you see with UAC/MacOS. OS will look at what apps the user installs/uses and enable based on that (ie, someone who downloads VS Code, Aida32, Hex Editors etc won't have this enabled but someone who just uses Chrome, VPN and other basic things will). Can still be manually enabled.\n \nElaborates on the 'Microsoft Pluton' project - something that MS will update themselves - implementing this due to how terrible OEM's handle TPM standards themselves.\n \nWorking with major 3rd parties to reduce permission requirements (so that admin isn't required to use). MS starting to move towards a memory safe language in the kernel with RUST.\n \nScrapping the idea of building security technologies around the kernel based on users having admin rights, and making users non-admin by default - discusses the challenges involved with this and how they need to migrate many of the win32 tools/settings away from requiring admin rights first before implementing this. Toolkit will be on Github to preview.\n \nExplains how they're planning to containerise win32 apps (explains MSIX setup files too).

The previous server was on Server 2016. \n When I install WDS on the new Server (in Standalone mode, same mode WDS was using under previous set up) I can't approve any pending devices and get an \"Element not found\" error message. \n WDS settings used: \n PXE Response: Respond to all client computers (known and unknown) - Require admin approval for unknown computers is ticked. Boot: Known/unknow clients: Continue the PXE boot unless the user presses the ESC key DHCP: Do not listen on DHCP ports - unchecked, Configure DHCP options to indicate that this is also a PXE server - unchecked TFTP: Maximum Block Size: 0, Enable Variable Window Extension - unchecked Rest are as defaults \n I've found that if I untick 'Require admin approval for unknown computers' the devices skip the pending stage and will image fine but I need to be able to retain control of which devices can receive an image through PXE. \n I also have found that I can click the Approve and Name option, give the client I am trying to image a name and run through a wizard without filling in any of the other options and it then works. I found the flat file that contains the approved clients on the old server and every device has a name like 'Domain Admin1' 'Domain Admin2' and so on. It's not the end of the world to have to do it this way but I'm still hopeful there is a way to get it to work like I had on the older server where I could simply right click the client and hit approve.\n The new server is domain joined member server only with just the WDS role installed.

          "description": "TL;DR - Has anyone else run into employees using low-cost VPN providers and how have you dealt with it?\n We recently implemented a robust security platform and have since discovered that about 10 of our work-from-home users are using low-cost VPN providers to connect to our corporate resources ( We do not have or require a corporate VPN in place for access as all of the resources are publicly web-based). We found that a few of them are choosing to have endpoints in South America and Europe. Despite the increased latency from the VPN and the subsequent latency from the endpoint location they are picking (we are US based), 9 out of 10 of these people aren't technical and have no idea why they are using a VPN apart from it making them \"safer\". \n Much like other employers, we now state that employees must have their own reliable internet connection at home, but that's where it stops. Keep in mind that these low-cost VPN providers are not being installed on any corporate-owned devices and are either being installed on their personal PC that they are then accessing things like OWA or other web-based resources, or a few that have installed and setup the VPN inside their home firewall and is funneling all traffic from their internal network through the VPN. Please refrain from suggesting to just shut their access off. I am looking for how others have handled this situation and not suggestions on how to screw the users over.\n The real-world impact of the users using these VPN providers is that it affects their performance, sometimes creating \"impossible travel\" alerts when they switch endpoints, and possible blindspots to security threats (as explained in the next sentence). I am hesitant to create policy exceptions in the security platform as the threat hunters indicated that a lot of real-world bad actors use these VPN providers to help add an extra layer of obfuscation when attacking a target.\n    submitted by    /u/excitedsolutions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Essentially I have SMB connections dropping at random. Could be a mapped drive or an open file in excel. \n Typically to recreate the issue I have a drive mapped to our file share and I work with files on the shares. When the connection drops my mapped drive shows connected but shows no used space indicator. Try opening the drive and it askes for authentication; however, any authentication is met with access denied. If I unmap the drive or in some cases the drive won't be mapped but I have notepad++ open with a file from the share it will recover.\n ​\n I've tried all the typical troubleshooting with SMB. Wireshark shows the access being denied, almost looks as if the client thinks it already is auth'd but the server sees it as anonymous. Wiresharked both client and server and confirmed they are communicating. Procmon shows nothing useful. SMBClient, server and connectivity logs show absolutely nothing about my user ID even authenticating or anything related to my connection.\n ​\n I've tried using the DFS share, regular UNC path with hostname and IP and still get access denied. It's not tied to one specific client, server or user.\n ​\n Really stuck on this one if anyone has an idea.\n ​\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/doublez3r0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Well, basically the title. We got our hands on a few Igel Thin Clients through a refurbished shop on ebay (not some backyard sale - kind of shop but one with a long history of selling on ebay various kinds of refurbished material). Model M340C to be specific. We plan to use them as emergency backup devices, y'know? Worst case and that, in case everything goes wrong, you have some old devices in a box that you can pull out and use with a temporary license. \n However, the devices seems to be still configured with the data from the former owner. Not that there is much to harvest, it's set to load a website that's not existing anymore and that's all. As far as I can tell at least. However I can't get into the admin settings to delete the certificate or other settings as it's password locked.\n Igel Clients can't be reset to factory settings (as far as I know) without involving the Igel support (think of it like the 48 character code for bitlocker locked devices) and that might require some informations of the previous owner, that we don't have. I'm confident that they still may help us however, that would be a bit time consuming to prepare that codes for all the devices and the discussion with them. \n So I hoped that someone might know a different workaround, if I can access the device on a different way and get rid of the certificate that prevents me from adding it to the managment suite and so on. \n Also I hope that since the devices are not reset, that the former owner also didn't removed the licenses. Since that requires a maintenance subsription with Igel, there is a solid chance the license is still on it and is hardware/MAC bound. A reset would remove that.\n    submitted by    /u/Interesting-Gear-819  \n [link]   [comments]",

Apologies in advance.\n I need to know what I need to do to give our help desk guys the ability to join computers to the domain and unjoin them as well. When I've researched it, I seem to get a plethora of answers that revolve around modifying domain root permissions, which I'd not like touch unless I know exactly what is needed. \n Apparently, their ability to do so existed at some point before I joined in the company, but it broke shortly before I came onboard.\n There is already an AD group that they are all a member of, but from what I've looked at in AD and our GPs, I can't find anything that ever tied them to being able to join/remove. For reference, there is already a GPO that makes them local machine admins of computers in our root/\"Workstations\" OU. Nothing touching the doman root\\Computers container. \n My best guess is that I need to give them write permissions to the Computers container (and our Workstations OU), so that they have the ability to join/remove, but I don't know what needs to be done exactly.\n Any input is incredibly appreciated!\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Capable-Hedgehog-819  \n [link]   [comments]",

They used to outsource their IT to MSP but since hiring me, we are doing away with that. We have some locations that have Sophos firewalls and some that have no firewalls. I want to standardize everything but don't particularly want to invest in more Sophos. I don't love their product, but don't hate it either, just kind of in the middle - unimpressed but it works ok. By the way, I have a good grasp on networking as I've been in the industry 15 years, but I'm really a jack of all trades and a master of none meaning I'm not a network engineer so I want something easy to manage. We are lucky to have no on prem servers or anything special, so have a very easy/uncomplicated network topology. Everything is cloud based, SaaS, Azure AD, soft phones, and just desktop PC's/laptops and printers. Also no VPN requirement since we don't host anything. My requirement is to have something very easy to manage, uncomplicated, yet provide great protection.\n When I replace the Sophos and purchase 7 new firewalls, I'm looking at the following.\n Palo Alto - Seems to be geared towards enterprise, no doubt one of if not the best in the industry for protection. May be too much to manage 7 of these without network engineer level experience on top of all my other duties?\n Fortinet - Seems to be a great solution, runner up to Palo Alto, maybe cheaper depending on the model. Easier to manage but still plenty of protection?\n Cisco Meraki - Seems to be expensive for what it is, less feature sets, but very easy and reliable. However again we have a simple network so don't need many features just something that works. Licensing is a little expensive, and if you don't pay up, your firewall stops working.\n So with my requirements and the firewalls I'm looking at, any recommendations if you were in my shoes?\n    submitted by    /u/LoneSysAdm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm not bashing this guy or anything. I'm far from a perfect employee and way too new to the job to be a good sysadmin. Its just bizarre and something that I notice a lot. \n Yesterday, my coworker approached the team with a server \"issue\" he found on one of our monitoring programs and proposed a potential solution.\n Here's the thing:\n I found this issue back in March. Brought it to my team's attention, investigated it and documented my findings. Then coordinated with the networking team to discuss resolving it. \n We found that the \"issue\" has literally zero impact on performance, and the act of resolving it would require bringing down the server's application. And my bosses boss said that he didn't think that tradeoff was worth it. Bringing down an important application for several hours to \"fix\" something that doesn't affect the server or the application, whose only impact is a very occasional alert on a monitoring program. \n The ultimate resolution was to leave it as-is. \n So I told my coworker that, showed him my work, and forwarded him the email where everyone agreed that it was a non-issue. \n But apparently that wasn't good enough, and he proceeded to bring the application down on his own, with no conferring with the team, against the wishes of everyone else who already worked on the problem, to perform the \"fix\". \n I swear, this guy sometimes just does things for the only reason of creating the appearance that he's \"fixing\" problems that aren't actually there.\n We haven't had our daily meeting yet so no one has discussed his decision to do this on his own yet. So we'll see how that goes. But geez. \n He otherwise does good work, and I'm not casting stones because I have my faults too. So I just find it odd that he chooses to do things like this.\n    submitted by    /u/AnarchyPigeon2020  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello. I am a total noob for tape backups and am a little lost here. I would appreciate any advice.\n I have been working in tech for a long time and manage a lot of infrastructure, but I have never needed to back something up to tape. Currently I work at a research institute and we have to keep data for a very long time, and we want to fill up a fire safe with a bunch of tapes for this reason.\n My data environment is a mix of offline hard drives, NAS, and some compute clusters.\n My problem is I do not really know what to do here. Dell keep trying to get me to buy massive units that will fill up my racks and store a bunch of tapes inside them as a managed system, but all I need is a way to write to the tapes and then remove the tapes to the safe. I think to this end I can either get an external tape drive, or a small server with a tape drive in it so everyone relevant can access? Am I correct here that I dont need any substantial hardware.\n Secondly they keep asking me about software, what I am going to use to write the tapes for storage. Having looked in to it it seems it is not so simple as drag and drop, and I need a software package to write the data to the tapes. My question here is, does anyone have recommendations for a lightweight software program I can use in an enterprise environment for this? I dont need anything comprehensive just occasional writing to single, unmanaged tapes.\n Apologies if these are silly questions. I have been struggling to find simple directions for what I need to purchase.\n ​\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Akio_Cuki  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am thinking of transitioning to the civilian sector, kinda done with military lifestyle and want to be with my family. I have reservations for finding a quality salary to match the pay and benefits I have now.\n I've been in the field for about 7 years but realistically, IT only fills like 30-40 of my time at work. Mostly AD user management, vm management, help desk services and network management. I feel like my skill set is too wide and I can't command a high salary for a senior sysadmin or project manager.\n If I don't transition, I'll end up being forced into more personnel management which is not what I want to do. I want to remain technical.\n I just graduated in the fall with a BS in CompSci and have Sec+. Planning on attaining CCNA in a few weeks. \n I just feel like I don't know enough or be competent enough to comfortably transition.

          "description": "I hope you're all doing well. I recently got a new server for setting up our own virtual environment, moving away from using an MSP and ESXi. We opted for some Dell servers, nothing too fancy since we'll only be running about 3 or maybe 4 Windows VMs.\n Here's the thing: I've been going through the Dell documentation, trying to understand how to set up BitLocker on this server. I've used BitLocker before on laptops and old servers, where it would prompt for the key or passphrase upon reboot. But now, it seems like because this server has a TPM 2.0 chip, that might not be necessary?\n I've come across conflicting guides and articles from Dell, so I'm feeling a bit confused. Our server has two drives: one for the OS and another for data storage (a few 2TB drives). When I go to manage BitLocker, I have the option to save the recovery key to a file or print it. So, I saved the key on a USB drive and made additional backups on OneDrive, our NAS, and SaaS backup. For now, I've only enabled BitLocker on the OS drive using the \"used space only\" option since it's currently empty.\n But here's the weird part: after rebooting, it didn't ask for the key. Many of the guides I've found talk about selecting the TPM module and setting up auto-unlock options, but my server just boots up without any prompts. I'm assuming that for the second drive, I can simply right-click it and enable BitLocker in the same way.\n Is this normal behavior with a server that has a TPM chip? Does it automatically unlock BitLocker? To be honest, that's what I'm hoping for, especially since I plan to move to remote management soon (if it's allowed). I want things to be easy during patching nights and remote maintenance.\n I'd appreciate any insights or clarification on this matter.

Because we use Port replicators that gave issues. (just mentioning this because maybe it helps with the main problem).\n The Wifi problem - Almost no internet at our buildings (250Kbps to 2.5Mbps), when working from home no problem: \n Only on certain laptops. \n Working laptop has between 80Mbps-100Mbps\n followed this whole guide: https://www.thetechwire.com/internet-slow-on-one-computer-but-fast-on-another/\n Compared laptop(s) with another laptop and everything is the same(drivers/updates/hardware/... .\n Took the Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201 Intern WLAN 2400 Mbit/s from a \"working\" laptop to a not working laptop. Issue remains.\n Switched the power plan to balanced (i gained 2-3Mbps).\n The Wifi isn't REALLY bad at some places. When the faulty laptop connects to AP1 you can have 3.5MBps and when the laptop connects on AP2 it can only have 250Kbps.\n It doesn't matter if only 1 laptops is connected to that AP or 10. Issue stays the same.\n We already restarted all the AP's(didn't replace an AP though).\n When i take a look on our firewall the decibels are for the working and faulty laptop the same.\n We have a Fortinet FortiGate 100F Firewall\n \n \n  \n-------------\n What i think the problem is: Our firewalls. The problem is that i don't know how to pinpoint the cause of the problem. Is there any tool that can push me in the right direction or does someone have some cool tips & tricks?\n ​\n If you have any questions, i'll try to anwser them asap.\n Ps: i'm not an network engineer.

Today I was humbled by a loss of DNS into AD in one of the SBS servers, I was going nowhere, into the wee hours.\n So Chattie & I went for it. \n Question 17 (still no results) the AI threw up an old Server Fault post along with several others.\n https://serverfault.com/questions/566304/dns-event-id-4000-on-sbs-2011\n Chattie: The command nltest /sc_change_pwd:<fqdn> is used to reset the secure channel password between a domain controller and the domain. \n The secure channel password is used to encrypt all communications between the domain controller and the domain. \n If the secure channel password becomes out of sync between the domain controller and the domain, then you may experience problems \n with Active Directory replication, authentication, and other services that rely on Active Directory.\n ​\n UnNamed Fella: We solved this issue by running the following command on our domain server:\n nltest /sc_change_pwd:<fqdn>\n Afterwards we had to restart the server.\n ​\n Chattie: You should replace <fqdn> with the fully qualified domain name of the domain controller. \n For example, if the domain controller’s fully qualified domain name is dc1.contoso.com, \n then you would run the command nltest /sc_change_pwd:dc1.contoso.com.\n ​\n Me: we were both wrong. Here is the results of two attempts - the last just using the domain:\n C:\\Windows\\system32>nltest /sc_change_pwd:tcib-sbs.tcib.local\n I_NetLogonControl failed: Status = 1355 0x54b ERROR_NO_SUCH_DOMAIN\n Better: \n C:\\Windows\\system32>nltest /sc_change_pwd:tcib.local\n Flags: 0\n Connection Status = 0 0x0 NERR_Success\n The command completed successfully.\n nltest.

          "description": "Greetings. I am making this post to seek assistance from fellow system administrators that have come across difficulty at getting a job at one point or another in their careers. \n I worked as a system administrator in the DoD for several years. I still have a clearance. Recently got out several months ago. I am working through a Cybersecurity degree and I have the following certifications: Network+, Security+, CySA+, Server+, Linux+ and Blue Team Level 1. My experience is quite broad, during my time in I was the head system administrator for a 50+ server network of virtualized Windows and Linux servers. There really isn't a single thing I am expert level at. The nature of my job required me to dip my toes in SQL, Cisco, Alcatel, Linux, Windows, fiber repair, Active Directory, Exchange, and many other things. Despite several revisions to my resume as well as professional resume reviews, getting a job post military has been very difficult. I have upskilled in the security analyst side of things, getting a decent handle on digital forensics tools and incident handling and investigation through tools like Splunk. I did this to sort of round out my skills and open up the possibility of going a more cyber focused route. But again I find myself at a point in which my skills and experience are super broad. \n I have applied to hundreds and hundreds of positions. Only received one interview of which I did really well during. They asked very simple sysadmin related questions about DHCP, Exchange, Active Directory. Baby stuff. Yet two weeks later I was told I didn't get it. At this point I decided to specialize and get better at Linux. I am not sure what to do really. I know many are struggling with the job market. It has been absolutely demoralizing and at some point my savings are going to run up. I have even applied to numerous jobs below my skill and experience level with no success. I don't know what to do.\n    submitted by    /u/marble_grapevine  \n [link]   [comments]",

Secondly, our current environment for background is 4 Hyper-V hosts running Server 2012 R2 with each machine running 2 VMs\n So, has anyone done an in-place upgrade of Server 2012 R2 to Server 2019 of a Hyper-V host that's running VMs? I appreciate that the relevant VMs will be down for a period during this (if it works) which I'm cool with as we're a Mon-Fri 9-5 business but I'm more concerned about any pitfalls or issues that could occur during this that I haven't thought of (mainly because I've not done it this way before)\n The plan was to shut down the VMs, disable auto start, throw up the 2019 ISO on the host and just follow the prompts for in-place as though it was a standard server (I've done plenty of in-place on the average server). Is there anything that will stop me from doing this? Anything I need to look out for?

The odd thing was that on any other PC the files works fine for these same users and they never got the spinning circle of death.\n Well I had talked to them and gave them a work around of going into task manager and finding a second Access task and ending that and then the files opened fine, and I got a verbal confirmation from the users that this was good enough so I stopped working on the issue.\n ​\n Fast forward to today where I get a call from their supervisor pissed that this issue is occuring for them and when is it going to be fixed. Yeah, it's my fault for not CYOA, but I recalled at that moment that whenever they had this issue the .accdb access files would open fine no matter what.\n So I opened each .mdb in edit mode where I could see all the forms, macros, tables, etc and I just copied all of them and pasted into a new .accdb file and named it the same thing. From what i could tell everything seemed to be working fine. They were not some crazy complex things, just a few tables, forms, queries, and macros.\n I really won't know 100% though until end of week, but that should be fine right?

It's a VM so I just reboot it and now it's stuck in a blue screen/reboot loop. Okay whatever, needed an excuse to retire/upgrade that server anyways, and I've got a physical DHCP 2016 server on hot-standby so not too big of an issue.\n Come in this morning and now the issue has spread to our Printing Server and Domain Controller VMs. Print server actually seemed fine with a reboot but the DC got stuck in a boot loop just like DHCP. Also not a big deal since I've got a physical 2022 server that actually serves as the primary DC but still this just seems wild to me that it all happened at once.\n Granted none of this has been a real show-stopper since we've got redundancy but I was just wondering if anyone else had run into 2012R2 suddenly offing itself recently. Or just any other fun monday morning blues.\n I'll also update this thread if I figure out anything. Servers seem to be booting when I remove their networking adapters in Hyper-V so that's a thing\n    submitted by    /u/DH_Net_Tech  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have our guest network segregated by VLAN and it cannot communicated with any other internal networks. However, our Guest to WAN (internet) firewall rule only allows HTTP/HTTPS and a few other web and email related ports. Lately we have had some people complain about certain smart phone apps not working on the guest wifi. After doing some digging I found that some apps require other ports to be allowed in order to fully work. One example is the Sonic Drive-In app, it would not allow you to get to the check out screen. When I did a packet trace it showed port 5671 was blocked. I opened it as a test and now the app works. I have a few other apps with similar connection issues.\n Does anyone just allow Guest to WAN with ANY service allowed?

All will be either WD or Seagate.\n Would love to know anyone’s thoughts, as I don’t think we’ll be getting WDs anytime soon.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ReelBack96  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need a script or tool that detects file changes or deletion in a specific folder and restores the files by deleting the newly created files and copying the original files over from a backup folder. \n The reason why I need this is because I'm running a program that keeps deleting two files and creating two new ones with the same name that keep breaking the whole thing and I am tired to keep copying the two old files back and forth. Before I could just mark the two files as read only with the windows tools which kept them untouched, but as of now since a new update of the program it now deletes the files and makes new ones. \n ​\n Thanks in advance! :)\n    submitted by    /u/iMD20  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'll try not to make this too long, here is the basic recap of the situation:\n I was hired as the first security engineer for a company with around 300 total users. They have absolutely 0 infrastructure or security tools in the environment currently.\n  \nAll windows machines running windows 10 home\n no active directory\n no endpoint protection\n all machines currently have the same login credentials and each user then logs into office 365 and other apps using their own credentials\n  \nThe infra/security team was recently created when the CTO hired a sysadmin (2 months ago), 1 tech support guy, and myself. I didn't really receive any sort of training since well there's nothing really to train. I asked the CTO for any diagrams or info about the current setup and she gave a single network diagram with switches and 1 gateway (which we can't access - it was setup by a third-party and they didn't leave a config file or credentials). I decided to try to use the CIS controls as a base point to suggest security improvements. Basically I wrote a proposal with the help of the new sysadmin saying we should get Windows 10/11 Pro, install AD, and use Defender for endpoint protection (this would required upgrading from O365 business standard to O365 business premium). \n Long story short, the CTO rejected the proposals saying she's not convinced that what we proposed will solve the security issues. She said to focus on security policies and to prepare for ISO certification.\n My question is what the fuck do I do here? Has anyone ever had a CTO who either didn't know what AD was or was really against its use? Is there any other way to manage machines remotely that is more cost-efficient? Should I just look for a new job that has more reasonable leadership?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/faubsam2020  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then gave us tools which created 20GB+ log files in the span of 15 mins and said they couldn't assist us any further so that ended up getting parked. The actual MS \"SME\" on the call was mediocre next to a helpdesk tech.\n As part of the analysis/fix we accidentally disabled a setting in Group Policy which effectively broke a lot of app services and caused other issues as it stopped the SOE / IE from being able to call out to the internet properly.\n At no point did the MS techs warn us of this and when we spent a day running through everything to figure out the problem and identified it was issues with the SOE using the PAC we sent more logs to Microsoft who literally just said \"yes it looks like you have a problem communicating with the internet we should do a log network trace\" and it's only after handing over to the EMEA support (which nobody communicated to us, we were just sat waiting a few hours) that we got a good way forward. \n The only time I've seen (Non MSP) vendor support any worse was dealing with Oracle's APAC managers and DBA support.\n    submitted by    /u/TheUrbanisedZombie  \n [link]   [comments]",

The plan is to have an e-mail address \"support@ourcompany.com\" that pumps the tickets into the ticketing system (osTicket) and only accepts mail from us to prevent other people from creating random tickets.\n The support of our mail hoster said we could create rules for this using the Sieve language. I've tried multiple variations that should imo get this done, but it's not working.\n Current version of the script:\n if address :contains :domain \"from\" [\"ourcompany.com\", \"ourcompany2.com\", \"ourcompany3.com\"] { keep; stop; } else { discard; } \n I've tried with :matches :domain and with :contains :all but sending test mail from an outlook.com address still lets through the e-mail. I also tried with if not address ... discard; but that yields the same, unsatisfying, result.\n Has anyone run into this before?\n Edit: I accomplished what I wanted to do, even if not in the exact way I'd have liked.\n I created two ticket filters in osTicket to do this. I need two filters because if I only apply the second filter, all e-mail gets rejected for some reason and no tickets are created.\n Filter 1: \"E-Mail accept\" \n Priority: 1 Stop execution on filter match: Yes Filter any of criteria: User Email contains \"ourcompany.com\" User Email contains \"ourcompany2.com\" User Email contains \"ourcompany3.com\" Do: Set help topic to \"Support\" \n Filter 2: \"E-Mail reject\"\n Priority: 2 Stop execution on filter match: No Filter any of criteria: User Email NOT contains \"ourcompany.com\" User Email NOT contains \"ourcompany2.com\" User Email NOT contains \"ourcompany3.com\" Do: Disable notification on new ticket Discard ticket \n    submitted by    /u/electric_medicine  \n [link]   [comments]",

My idea would've been to consolidate all of the hardware onto a pair of powerful servers (one located at our offices, the other one off-site) and virtualize all 100+ machines onto these servers – that way, if one of these VM servers were to fall over, the team would be able to rapidly spin up a new server & get the branch up and running very quickly (15 minutes max). this idea got shot down. \n \nWe use a mix of local AD, Google Workspace & M365 as our environment. I've been trying to convince both my team lead (who's the IT manager) and boss (the CIO/CTO) to try and unify everything under one vendor for ease of deployment, management & troubleshooting for the long term – once again, the idea got shot down. \n \nAll our infrastructure is not managed by any form of MDM, I pitched this idea, and it got promptly shot down. \n \n I really like the current workplace, but trying to convince them to change/rebuild the current infrastructure for the better, just results in resistance from them. I’ve tried to talk to them to see why they are resisting change/shooting down any ideas. the only reasons that I got from the CIO/CTO was that it's due to financial & \"if it isn't broken, don't fix it\" reasons. So far, I’ve been unsuccessful in trying to get *any* ideas to stick.\n Any advice on how to approach this?\n (P.S. this is my 2nd proper job as I had to leave the 1st one due to health reasons. Also, excuse the weird formatting; LibreOffice & Reddit's new UX don't like each other a bit)\n    submitted by    /u/s12a  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are several users popping in requests for Google accounts for collaborating with other orgs that are using Google. Most of them have been creating personal gmail accounts.\n At my previous gig we were a Google shop and needed Microsoft 365 for some folks. We had onprem AD and were able to sync logins across all platforms. Am I crazy for thinking we can do the reverse in this case? We have azure ad instead of onprem. I would imagine I can disable gmail and restrict Google drive to make sure we maintain data governance, but that is all conjecture at this point as I’ve never done it before.\n Any thoughts from people who have done it before? Will disabling gmail totally break other apps? I’m probably missing a lot but open to suggestions. My team thinks we should investigate the use cases more as there’s a perception we don’t really need Google accounts to collaborate like this. They may be right but it could end up being more work trying to walk multiple external orgs through proper sharing processes so we can work with them.\n    submitted by    /u/Spudthegreat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I work at a mid size non profit and we use an IT vendor to manage our network and computers. We have a mix of ITaaS and HaaS agreements with them but I’m looking to purchase more equipment elsewhere when needed because it’s often much cheaper and I’d rather us own the equipment and not get locked into rental agreements. \n We’re opening a new office and now I find out they will not let us purchase a firewall. We have to rent one from them in a 5 year agreement that’s about twice the price than if I purchased elsewhere. They say it’s because they lump in the IT management fee for the firewall in the rental price. \n Is this reasonable or common practice? I don’t see why we can just buy a firewall and pay them a management fee. \n Thanks for reading.\n    submitted by    /u/Pale_Dress9615  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all. I've asked this question before on other subs, but none have been able to figure it out.\n I have two fairly old Macs desktops, running windows, and I'm trying to wipe everything and just use Linux (Ubuntu).\n I'm struggling with getting them to boot from USB. I've tried ventoy (not supported on Macs), and making a bootable USB through Linux mints' standard \"make a bootable USB\" option. Both give me \"secure boot 14\" error. But googling that gives we information about windows?\n At this point I just want to nuke the machines, wipe everything and just have Ubuntu. I don't care about the windows partition because it runs too slow to be of any use anyway. There is no important data on them as the owners have resorted to just using their laptops.\n One machine has only windows on it, and it was still stuck at the splash screen after leaving it overnight. The other has a working windows OS on it - this is the main one I'm trying to save. Both throw up the same \"secure boot 14\" error.\n And to top it all off, they're all using Chinese language operating systems. So I'm reliant on Google translate from my phone to figure stuff out.\n Just for laughs: one of the business owners suggested solving the problem by buying a third Mac, and putting windows on it. Before throwing the keyboard at them (metaphorically speaking), I enquired as to why they:\n 1) didn't just use Mac OS in the first place because they just use it for excel, word, and Photoshop 2) didn't use a windows based machine 3) thought that buying a third Mac would solve the problem\n They don't know how to use Mac OS; Macs look nicer; a new Mac would be faster.\n    submitted by    /u/mattizie  \n [link]   [comments]",

The modified URL needs to be loaded from the pop-up window, not from a different browser window, so a little console trickery is needed...\n Below are the steps to replicate my workaround: \n  \nOpen CloudSync\n Click the + icon to create a new link\n Select Box and click Next\n The popup authentication window appears (with the 403 Forbidden error)\n Copy the entire URL\n Pressed Ctrl-Shift-I to bring up the Browser Developer Tools\n Switch to the console tab\n Type the following into the console (note the single apostrophe at the end):\n self.location = ‘\n Paste the URL copied in step 5\n Locate &state=http://x.x.x.x:5000 at the end of the URL and change it to:\n &state=http%3A%2F%2Fx.x.x.x:5000 (i.e. replacing the first : with %3A and each / with %2F. Don’t change anything else)\n Type a closing ’\n Press enter\n The Box authentication window should appear and you should be able to grant permission successfully.\n \n My sync is up and running after 8 days and lots of inconvenience.\n And now we wait for an official fix!\n    submitted by    /u/neillsun  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the last 2 years of support for them, we had like 3 or 4 devices that failed. To be fair, some were straight up old and gave up mostly because of that, however the others suffered from enviromental problems. A warehouse is full of various kinds of dirt & dust in the air that settles down everywhere. Employees touch things with dirty hands and so on.\n ​\n I thought it might be better to instead replace most TCs now with some higher quality devices (and switch at that time over to Igel OS) that last longer because they are designed for that enviroment.

The 2010 server itself is supposed to be patched. \n What I've checked:\n - In the EMC the server version shows \"14.0 (Build 639.21)\" - EMC is said to be inaccurate: Application binary versions (checked from the running store.exe location, no second wrong install locations) are 14.3.513.0, which should be the very last rollup of SP3\n - Get-ExchangeServer AdminDisplayVersion also shows \"14.0 (Build 639.21)\"\n - The current Exchange schema version is rangeUpper 15332 (or Exchange 2016 CU18)\n - The \"Exchange Servers\" AD group only contains current running (the 2010 and 2016) servers\n - In ADSIEdit, Configuration/Services/Microsoft Exchange/[domain]/Administrative Groups/Exchange Administrative Group (...)/Servers also only contains the current running servers\n What I've tried:\n - First, most of the instructions that were followed are from the Exchange Deployment Assistant\n - Trying to run the upgraded installer for 2010 just to be sure but it says nothing to upgrade\n - Searching for any non-installed updates through Windows update, including hidden ones - Restarted services and machines so no lingering processes should exist\n - Creating a new database on the 2010 server and moving mailboxes to it in case the database has an affected version as well \n Misc:\n - We currently do not intend to move to Exchange Online\n My current understanding would be that mailboxes also have a version and have to be upgraded. How do I go about doing that? Otherwise, what issue am I not seeing?\n    submitted by    /u/WalkFrontAgentParty  \n [link]   [comments]",

So for share permissions I have Everyone full control. For the NTFS permissions I have SYSTEM(FULL), LOCAL ADMINS(FULL), and DOMAIN COMPUTERS(READ). The LOCAL ADMINS group on the file server has domain admins inside of it. Everything is working fine and the application inside of it is being deployed without issue while at the same time no users have any access to the folder except DOMAIN ADMINS.\n Now the strange thing is if I'm on the file server with my domain admin account and I try to open the folder by either the filesystem or the share I get prompted with the message \"You don't currently have permissions to access this folder. Click continue to permanently get access to the folder.\" Remember the local admins on the file server has the domain admins in the group. Not sure why it's telling me I don't have access. Now if I click continue it adds my DA account to the NTFS permissions explicitly. This is screwing up our folder permissions consistency. If I didn't truly have access as the message stated how did it explicitly add my DA account with full control? That seems kind of messed up if that was really the case.\n One final note. If I'm on my office machine and run computer management as my DA connecting the file server and then navigate to the shares, when opening the folder I don't get prompted with the message above. If I look at the NTFS permissions everything is correct. WTF? I have to say I'm confused by this one.

It checks if the account is registered with the Microsoft Authenticator app or any 3rd party authenticator app. If the account hasn't enabled MFA it will flag them with a date using custom security attributes, and in 7 days if they haven't registered MFA it will disable their account. \n ​\n Just to note I have this disabling the users on-premises account since we're assuming they're synced users from AD. You can always adjust the script to meet your needs as I have a function in there to disable the users Azure AD account but you will need to stop syncing the accountEnabled attribute in AAD Connect.\n ​\n https://github.com/adriancmilian/mfavalidator\n    submitted by    /u/TheeMeepman  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyways, I got an email when I sign up for a domain name through the company Hover. I've had a few issues with this company, including very slow emails sinking, and troubles with linking it to my Gmail account, but something that I find it very weird and doesn't make sense to me is why a lot of times when I try to sign up for some thing using my email address it says that my email is invalid. For example if I go to a grocery store and try to sign up for their rewards card or something, usually it says that my email is not valid and they asked me if I spelled it right, etc. When this happens I often feel defensive like \"listen pal, I pay for this email address and it's definitely legit - do you want me to prove it to you? what's your email address? I'll email you right now!\" lol. Only half joking. But seriously, why is this happening, and is there a way to fix it? I did use my email name to be [info@myname.com](mailto:info@myname.com) - so perhaps some people think it's a fake name, and like a chump like me couldn't possibly have such a personalized email, but is it a problem with Hover? Or is it a problem with my email settings?

We recently went with KnowBe4 for security training, and we are utilizing the phish alert button. Currently it's setup to send an email to our team with an attachment of the email (I think this is the default) but with how many employees we have vs how many people are monitoring and managing it the folder I have them going to is filling up rather fast.\n Does anyone else using this service have any tips or tricks to possibly automating this to grab the header information of the emails using PowerShell or even power automate? This is my first admin job so I am kind of a beginner to power automate and the exchange module in PowerShell. I currently have 250+ emails that are reported as phishing and it seems counter productive to open each one then go into the properties and scroll through the header info to find the domain or IP and block it in exchange. I also know I would need to proof some of them as some people report emails that their bosses send to them lol. \n I do know in KnowBe4 there is an option if using the add-in via exchange to add header info to the email when reported but that isn't working for me for some reason, I also would prefer to learn more on the automation side if possible.\n I know they also have a package you can purchase that would help with this via KnowBe4 but just getting KnowBe4's service for a security audit was a nightmare due to an \"IT Budget\" not existing. \n ​\n TLDR: Looking for recommendations or pointers in the right direction to automate the KnowBe4 Phish Alert Button to grab the header information from emails that are reported by users and sent to me to help efficiently block them in exchange.\n    submitted by    /u/nice_crocs  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only possible actions I can either attempt to change my safe attachment setting to send an email upon full scan (which doesn't appear to be a thing anymore from what I've seen) or forward the original email yourself to have the email rescanned.

One thing that the old MDM couldn't do was automatically upgrade iOS devices. For the current MDM to do that it needed devices to be in the ABM. The current MDM can also control a lot of settings (CIS policy recommendations) but some settings required the devices to be in the ABM so those can't be set by it. So to me, it looks like Apple only lets an MDM solution have access to whatever it decides to allow it to manage. Of course that could just be the MDM I'm using. Now with the move to Intune I'm being told by the consultant that it can push iOS updates without the ABM being used. Is this true? Also, does Intune have access to all of the iOS settings/controls without the ABM? I would like to be wrong here but I'd rather get in front of it now if the ABM is needed. Last thing I want is to find out later that I was right and using ABM is necessary to have full control over the apple devices.\n    submitted by    /u/pw1111  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I was thinking about using Grafana, there is some module I can use with Apache mod_status extended. But this sounds like not really \"professional\", it uses a github module to export status on prometheus, and then I have to re-code some part to get the extended status which interests me...

I've got it partially working to recognize the card, prompt for pin, check user principal name in the card certs to match against AD account, then finally login. But issue comes when machine goes to lock enabled screensaver after some idle time, the user tries to unlock but it never prompts for PIN though it might say please insert your card. If you manually lock and unlock within a few minutes, it seems to load the smart card module and prompt for PIN then login in. If it's been idle for a longer time, it fails to recognize the smart card and user has to reboot machine for it to be recognized again. Reading online the solutions I've come across are using VMware horizon client but I don't have licensing or setup for that. The issue is also supposedly fixed in RHEL 8 with a newer version of pcsc-lite. I have also turned on gdm debugging and have seen a few errors regarding account expiration policy not found and the pam_pkcs module failing to load. Not sure why if during initial login it works 100% of the time. I'm thinking it's unreliable USB redirection with the VMware player and card reader so I'm gonna try installing the image directly on a machine to circumvent using VMware player/workstation software.\n    submitted by    /u/kenyakickz25  \n [link]   [comments]",

My particular issue stems from their refusal to contact me via email. They always call. I don't WANT a phone call. Chances are I'm working on a different issue, on a different call, my mind's on another task, and I don't want to just drop everything. Especially if we're talking about a Sev3 or so where I just need a little guidance. Email's great, I can wrap up my current thought and then pivot to the support request.\n Since I can't get them to stop calling, and I'm tired of simply ignoring their call and then responding to the ticket as though I didn't notice, I wanted to force the issue. You can't remove your phone number entirely - it wants numbers in that box. But, it turns out the box isn't cross referencing with telco providers to ensure the phone numbers are legitimate. So a couple months I put some nonsense in there which would make it flatly impossible to call me, and promptly forgot I'd ever done so. Yeah you probably see this conclusion coming.\n Last Monday I opened an SR, and as the week dragged on, the silence started to grow more suspicious. By this morning it was clear that my SR had landed in the wrong queue, so I pull up the support site to check the status of the SR. Closed due to lack of customer contact because they were unable to reach me on the phone. I mean, of course you were unable to reach me, you can't dial 111-111-1111, it's simply not a thing. What the bloody hell list did I end up on where these people will not just email me? I'm leaving the number in there, I guess I'll just CC every account exec I've ever crossed paths with on every SR from now on with \"My preferred method of contact is by email\" pasted between every paragraph of every ticket I submit.\n Ahh Dell, you useless, useless company.\n    submitted by    /u/FoolStack  \n [link]   [comments]",

This doesn't appear to be a normal corrupt profile situation, their profile was deleted and created fresh upon login. \n Sometime overnight you can see the EventID 1 from Search-ProfileNotify saying the Windows Search Service indexed data for the user and it was successfully removed in response to user profile deletion. When they login you see a similar event that their profile is being created. What I'm trying to figure out is what in the world would have caused this request to happen. Are there no event ID's tied to a requested profile deletion or what triggered it?\n No Windows updates were deployed this week either.

In this instance, when I refer to PTO, I am also referring to sick leave, and vacation time, just not holiday pay. We were discussing how many days the average (full-time, 9-5, Mon-Fri) IT person needs in order to maintain a healthy work/life balance. I’m thinking 15 days is a good average, and my coworker is thinking something closer to 20, but we would love to get more opinions on the matter.\n As a follow up to that, what would be the minimum PTO/Sick Leave/Vacation time package you would accept from a prospective new employer?\n ​\n EDIT: Every person is different, and answering this kind of question can be tricky considering the different needs of different people, for the sake of this discussion, I am mainly referring to averages, to make it somewhat easier to answer. I also wanted to put a disclaimer here that I am not saying everyone should be able to make 15 days work for them, but just on average that is what most people probably would need to maintain a healthy work/life balance. Absolutely nothing wrong with needing more than that, or less than that in my opinion. \n    submitted by    /u/RandomSysAdmin828  \n [link]   [comments]",

After some password resets and talking to the user it seemed fine but then the third party were in again a few hours later. By now I figured my users computer was fucked and we took it offline while locking and/or resetting all their various accounts. Problem solved.\n Today when I got my hands on the computer I found the following:\n - Email received from a domain we generally trust (so they got compromised first) with a \"PDF\", ofc its an .exe but with file extensions being hidden.\n - Inexperienced user had launched it just an hour before the first odd logins.\n - Running it (on an empty user, offline) does open a PDF in the default browser (firefox) but the location is /appdata/roaming/winupdate_2025/out.pdf which is neither the location or name of the original file.\n Curious about how it got access to logins / passwords at this point but exhausted my very shallow knowledge.

Now this morning I am seeing all the bloatware is back, even though my policies are in place. \n Am I missing a setting, or is this crap finally unremovable? \n  \nEdit: Found it, fixed it. Now to test and implement. Check the comments below. Thanks all for contributing!\n  \n   submitted by    /u/tjn182  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have inherited a Unifi Wifi network which uses RADIUS to authenticate computers onto an Active Directory domain. \n Problem is, nearly every single laptop does NOT connect to wifi (v6) until the domain (or local) user logs in, and this is killing some, not all, of my GPO. \n As an example, I set a GPO to add a local admin on laptops. That works. But if I try to deploy an .msi it fails miserably, with error logs telling me the network wasn't available. If I run GUPDATE, it fails with the couldn't complete message, in that it knows there is an .msi in waiting type of thing. \n GP Result shows the policies are being applied to the local endpoint.\n I can give more detail when I am back in the office on specifics. \n If I plug the laptop into the network (physical cable) the .msi deploys without issue, so i am relatively happy that I set the GPO up correctly. \n I am not entirely sure RADIUS authentication is set up correctly on the DC, but if I am honest, I am a bit stuck where to look, or more importantly, how to check. \n I have set the network to wait, and the laptops now take 60secs to boot to a Windows log in screen, but the wifi is disconnected, so it's pretty pointless having wait for network in place! \n As mentioned at the beginning, I have inherited this, and there has been an absolute ton of work required to roll out an RMM to approx 150 laptops, much of which I've had to do via Powershell due to the .msi failing, plus other work to get the estate where it needs to be. This GPO thing has taken a back seat, but it is nagging at me to get it fixed. \n I could leave it now i have an RMM in place, but I would prefer to fix it and have it working as it should so it doesn't bite me in the future. \n I'm posting this from home on a public holiday, so don't have specific information to hand, but will gladly respond with any info when I am back in the office. \n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/NeuroT2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings:\n My company previously rented a Meraki from an MSP that managed our switches. When we went with a new MSP, they advised we purchase a Fortigate 80E. However, in so doing, we lost the ability to manage our switches without factory restoring them (the first MSP took their secrets with them). The next MSP that sold us the Fortigate always said they would get around to restoring our Cisco switches but ... well, they are out ex-MSPs for a reason.\n So, our company decides to move everything internal. Updating the network is my job. Our physical footprint is shrinking so we have some extra switches. I restore a Cisco SG300 to factory, patch/upgrade it move it into production as a replacement for an in-production, unpatched Cisco SG300 (like-for-like). \n The Fortigate was config'd to do all the heavy lifting. It does all the routing, hands out IP leases, etc. \n So here is the problem. The updated/patched Cisco is installed and up and running. Switching like a champ except it is not appearing at all in the Fortigate ARP table. Further still, the Fortigate keeps giving it an IP address that has already been assigned from the DHCP pool. When I attempt to take DHCP out the equation and assign the Cisco a static IP by MAC address it does not work because the Fortigate never gives an indication it sees the switch (no entry in the DHCP table, no entry in the ARP table). \n I suspect there must be something misconfigured on the Switch but I can't access the gui without a reliable IP address. I can access via console but I am not physically there until monday.\n So, in the interim, any ideas? I am sure its something simple I am missing but sometimes the simplest thing is the easiest thing to overlook.\n Thank you!\n EDIT: I’ll add that the web gui on Cisco was verified as working and it received a unique IP when it was not connected directly to the Fortigate.\n    submitted by    /u/HerefortheLAN  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is great except a large percentage of our staff use Macs and work outside of the office (don't ask!). Our current solutions is to have a bunch of desktop PCs running Splashtop (similar to TeamViewer) within the office so people on macs/working remotely can splashtop in and run the application.\n While the Mac users can boot-up a VM and run the tool via VPN we find that process is way too slow compared to just jumping on a Splashtop machine and opening the app (and requires them to be able to set up and manage a VM+VPN).\n This works ok but we're finding it's clearly not scalable or efficient.\n ​\n Does anyone know if MS/someone else offers a terminal server product that would be able to host multiple remote connections and instances of the same application at once? Alternatively is there a recommended method for having a server run say 6 VMs each with their own Splashtop instance? I imagine this clearly requires a special MS license?

I manage everything on the backend (NAS, VOIP, door access, etc), but I don’t have time to keep up with the workstations so it works. The MSP provides a security package for the users, handle printers, updates, and a few other odds and ends. We switched MSPs last year because of some interpersonal conflicts and the new company looked great. They had a nice portfolio, interviewed well, tickled my ears with a solid “we know this is your network we’re here to help”, AND they specialized in our business type. Part of their contract outside of their maintenance agreement was an AP upgrade for the building. They sold us on a UniFi system and we deployed. A few days go by and I start noticing some weird dropouts in a few different places so I put in a ticket for them to check the auto-negotiation of channels and see if the UDM recommended any changes, etc. crickets Two days later I follow up with an email crickets 3 days later I email the account manager and reply was “I don’t see anything on our end, if you have a minute can you log in and see what you see?” I let him know that a login wasn’t created for me yet, but I’d be happy to. I get the invite, accept, and my jaw hits the floor. The manager had given me access to every one of his accounts, with full admin, AND access to their other customer’s financial backups that they vaulted for them.

The non-technical guys told me that their in house engineering team 'overcomplicated' the process by adding a lot of if/else conditions, etc. The engineering team hasn't written any documentation, so I'm not inclined to believe that the process that they came up with is the most clear and easy to follow. At the same time, if the process was super simple (setting up a SharePoint form, automating tasks with Power Automate and Power Automate), then the non-technical team could have just used the drag and drop interface and do it themselves. It's sort of a typical issue where the non-engineers don't understand exactly what needs to be done on the technical side, so they think the issue is way more simple than it actually is. \n I've been asked to come up with a recommendation for the best path moving forward and I'm not super sure what to suggest. I'm leaning towards starting from scratch, writing custom JavaScript when needed, and then of course, writing clear and easy to use documentation. \n Part of me wonders though if the hardest part of this whole workflow is simply working through all these very domain specific edge cases. I can foresee issues down the line where the people giving the directions / exec team doesn't have a good understanding of their current systems, yet they'll still want a very specific result. \n I guess my question is what to 'recommend' for next best steps that gives the exec team confidence in my recommendations, and also reduces the headache / back and forth nitpicking that I am anticipating with the exec team?\n    submitted by    /u/blackhawktrip  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead they have these odd square holes surrounded by small circular holes. Problem: I also don't know what this is called so my Google-Fu is lacking.\n I know that attachments like this exist where you consume 1U or 2U to add horizontally-jutting out attachments which adds these sockets, but I've worked with those before and they really take up a lot of space in a rack that I'd rather be using for network cables (gone are the days of one cable per physical host, hah).

It had made it pas all our safeguards, looked legit but the person in accounting noticed the from email did not match the normal sender. \n While picking the email apart it was indeed a spoofed email with a .PDF malware attachment. Caught by a keen eye, the security training we've done and the test emails are working! \n Anyway through my dissection of the email i was able to track it back to the company that owned the domain and found that it was a compromised O365 account. It was a doctors office in NYC about 90 minutes from our location. \n I thought \"Great i got their contact info let me just give them a heads up to have their IT look into the issue.\" Let me tell you this did not go at all how i had hopped it would. \n I called their office and asked to speak with the Doctor running the practice or the office manager. After a moment on hold i got to speak with the office manager. I explained who i was, what company i was with and relayed my contact info should they need to follow up. I then explained that we received an email from their O365 portal and that one of their accounts or possibly their whole O365 account was potentially compromised and they should speak with their IT team to investigate. \n I don't know if i sent this poor persons brain into overload or what but as soon as i finished talking they started to berate me like i was somehow the person that compromised their systems. I didn't want any recognition i just wanted to do the right thing and let them know of the possible breach. But instead all i got was about 3 minutes of angry Karren before they simply hung up. \n Any one else come across something similar?

Someone tried updating cuda and it basically caused the SSD to not boot to the OS. A ton of error messages appeared. To make a long story short, I went into recovery mode, removed all NVIDIA drivers, cleaned it and booted to the OS with no problem. Once we rebooted the machine again, it reverted back to the previous state of not booting to the OS and now I'm not able to get to the recovery mode. I ran a ton of commands and can't get to recovery mode or to the login screen. So what I did was imaged another SSD and removed the old one. \n My question is, is there a way for me to get the data off of the old SSD and load it onto the newer SSD? There are a few very specific files they're wanting off of the old SSD, which will save them time in recreating everything from scratch. ORR would it be ok to connect the old SSD as a secondary drive and they get to the files from there while the tower boots to the newer SSD??? I'm just trying to figure out the best way to go about this and I'm by far not great with Ubuntu; it's too sensitive..lol. Any help would be appreciated.

I've set up some forwarding e-mails, e.g. finances@ourdomain.com to the personal adresses of our members. This is not the best solution since every position is occupied with at least two persons and everyone gets a copy of the E-Mail. In total we are talking about around 10-14 people/users and a total of around 6 shared inboxes.\n The next step was looking for an MS Exchange with shared inboxes and automapping to outlook. We cannot use the official O365 due to GDPR restrictions of our governing body and would have to use an on-premise solution. Microsoft does not allow for shared inboxes on mobile devices under on-premise hosting. All the available workarounds I found online (enabling insecure IMAP connections, enabling the deactivated user in the Exchange panel) are not allowed by either the hosting company or violate Microsoft licensing terms.\n So the next thought was several IMAP accounts. No usually as an admin, I'd have to give the shared account credentials to everyone involved. I stumbled upon the Nextcloud Mail App which allows for multiple mail accounts, maybe that's a solution. I've already posted this idea in the /r/Nextcloud subreddit.\n Do you have an idea concerning this matter? All in all, I want several users to connect to the same mailbox via their personal PCs (they use Outlook there) and their mobile devices (they either use a Mail App of their choice or I could talk them into using a separate app if neccessary).\n I'm really at loss here, hoping to get some ideas :)\n    submitted by    /u/mrfluffleballz  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are a mortgage company and our users do business with many 3rd parties. Emails were flowing with out issue up until recently. Communication between our users and external 3parties starts out as it should, then for some reason the detection methods go crazy and quarantines the emails. Its becoming a headache to monitor the quarantine, release and report/submit false positives to MS. In the past 30 days we have submitted over 500 emails as false positives. On the MS doc for Secure by Default, it states that this cannot be turned off by admins. And the percentage rate is low for false positives. I dis believe this as we are seeing a high impact. I have done some tweaking by adding these domains to safe senders list but this has little resolve as some of the messages are marked as High Conf Phish. While reviewing the report in quarantine for these emails nothing is being marked as a threat - attachments, urls or images . All pass. No campaign or other indicators except for \"Advanced Filter technology\". I have turned off \"mailbox intelligence\" in the filters but that has done nothing. I have opened a ticket with MS and its going no where fast. I have even shared the article they have published on Secure by Default and highlighted that part where it states safe emails are being marked as phishing.

I joined IT pretty late in my life, was 29 when I landed my first Helpdesk gig, 1.5 years later got headhunted by Microsoft to join their Helpdesk, made it to manager in 3 years from agent to supervisor then manager and yesterday got served my 3 month notice for redundancy. I’m based in the UK and I’m seriously disappointed. My comanager was barely around (constantly disappearing, never showing up to the office to look after his kids, taking weeks of sick leave) so I had to pick up on his slack and do the work of 2 full time managers. Even though we report to the same manager, I complained about him several times but my manager said there’s nothing she could do thanks to employee rights. Me being me, I constantly worked 10 hours a day as well as evenings, weekends, took my work laptop with me while I was on vacation to Spain and Cyprus. People see my success and obsessive nature but I sacrificed a lot, my girlfriend left me, I’m the fattest I’ve ever been, my cholesterol levels are through the roof and I’ve developed extremely painful haemorrhoids to where I almost passed out from the pain in the office bathroom. I get out of breath when tying my shoe lace! Now on top of everything I’ve been made redundant. \n I don’t have anything left in the tank to do anything more, I bombed my last interview as a manager for a fintech company and with only 1 years managerial experience it’s doubtful I’ll get another manager gig.

(If not obvious from the below list, all are free options for me at the moment)\n  \nUsing QNAP's built-in Hyper Data Protector tool\n Running Veeam Community on a separate, older Dell PowerEdge 1850 (would be spinning up as 3rd physical server)\n Running Veeam Community as a VM on one of the two Windows Servers\n  \nI'm currently backing them up using QNAP's HDP, which has been working fine. I'm a little nervous about its reliability and potential for vulnerabilities though, given it's not QNAP's main forte and they're not the most responsive to fixing them. I thought about trying out Veeam to see why everyone likes it so much. I know running on old hardware is a little risky, but I fear running it as a VM on the same hardware as the rest is riskier. If there's another free option I'm missing here that you'd recommend, I'd love to hear it.\n    submitted by    /u/WhoAmI1620  \n [link]   [comments]",

My org had an On-Prem Exchange server that they decommissioned several years back (before my time) when they moved to a hybrid Azure environment. All mail is Exchange Online now.\n When they started syncing users to Azure/O365, they left many of the current employees with a \"company.local\" UPN Suffix, as opposed to \"company.com.\" They also left all the msExch* attributes in tact.\n I recently implemented Conditional Access policies for MFA, and they wanted employees on site to be able to use a Hybrid-Joined computer in lieu of the MFA verification.\n So I set that up, but we discovered that it didn't work for some users. I found that it was due to the \"company.local\" UPN discrepancy between local AD and Azure (which had \"company.com\" as the Azure UPN). I switch the suffix and it fixed the CA issue.\n Director says to move everyone to the correct suffix to make it work, so I did that. Since the UPN's match, every user's msExch attributes are linked correctly in Exchange Online. \n Users now show this error in the admin.microsoft.com portal, under their Mail tab: This user's on-premises mailbox hasn't been migrated to ‎Exchange Online‎. The ‎Exchange Online‎ mailbox will be available after migration is completed.\n These user's already had a mailbox, and it seems that most of them have no issues using mail still. We did have one user who's mailbox disappeared, I removed the msExchMailboxGuid and other related attributes from their local AD account, and had to remove and reassign their Exchange Online license. This created a new mailbox for them, but it is a fresh mailbox and does not have any previous mail in it.\n I changed the Sync Rules in AD Connect to push NULL out for the msExchMailboxGuid for all users, and it did sync the NULL value for everyone. But the error is still there over a day later.\n Is there any way to resolve this without losing everyone's mailbox?\n    submitted by    /u/RefrigeratorSuperb26  \n [link]   [comments]",

I agreed with him and asked if he can cover for the last 30 minutes and again, the answer was NO. \n So today I set up a meeting and asked the same thing to the senior manager and he told me \"because we had a couple of departures from our team, he can't give me that flexibility. And there are no plans to hire anyone anytime soon.\" \n I mean, 2 people already left in last 2 months (my manager and another colleague), are you ready to lose another just for this one small request?(I guess they are lol)\n Anyways I guess it's time to start looking for another job. tbh, in my 10 years of career, I never had to choose between my family and my job. I always thought teammates help when needed.\n TL;DR: workplace indirectly asked me to choose between family and job\n    submitted by    /u/almostaussie13  \n [link]   [comments]",

Saying they report to \"so and so\" is NOT a reason.\n  \nWhen the meeting group gets the request they will vet it and see if your meeting is actually needed. If it isn't, then they will state the reason why and alternatives that you can do to get the result you need without having a meeting. EVERYONE is subjected to this - even the CEO\n If you try to go around them and host a meeting without their consent - you get sent to HR and they will handle things. You could lose the right to host a meeting, get written up, get a warning or even you could lose your job over this. This includes getting someone else to host the meeting for you when you have been told you are not allowed to host a meeting.\n After the meeting, ALL the folks who attended will be sent a survey to grade the meeting. This is used by the meeting group to grade the host. If the host keeps getting low scores, they are sent to training on how to host a meeting correctly. If they keep getting low scores after that, they are banned from hosting meetings.\n Meetings are by far the worst money waster in a company. Imagine how much could be done if pointless meetings could be eliminated.\n    submitted by    /u/_Volly  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use sys asmin very loosely so I was actually originally intended to do help desk.\n Somehow I've somehow found my way to working with firewalls, certs, GPOs, Endpoint-Management, Patching, as well as managing our ePO.\n  \nThe situation:\n Now when I say working on the firewall, I mean teaching our new network engineer how our firewall works as he had never interacted with it (our former left). I don't have the permissions to touch it myself, however I was asked to start managing our certs (some internal, and externals) which would have come with said permissions. I was also set up to manage a site by myself, this being on top of my usual tasks I have been working on.\n Keep in mind I am the only \"jr.\" and make the least money in our team of almost 20 despite me being one of the only 5-ish admins who work at the enterprise level. So with this, I decided to decide to come back and tell them I would be happy to do these things under the condition that they actually pay me more (I make 60, asked for 75).\n This request was then greeted with a sudden lack of interest as well as an email to colleagues behind my back to find out everything I am involved in and/or have been handed. Additionally asking them to stop laying as much work on me.\n  \nThe question:\n I have not received any response in an official capacity yet, but I have a bad feeling.

When prints are sent, it's taking a few minutes for it to wake up and print. No settings were changed. It's on a 2 hour sleep timer, which is the longest you can set, and within that time frame it will go back into this deep sleep. It's definitely losing network connection during this sleep, which is why prints are getting stuck in a queue till a point in which it wakes back up. I've found this out when attempting to ping it when reports come in that prints aren't going through.\n Has anyone ran into something like this? I'm leaning more towards an issue with the network or switch than a sleep or energy saving setting, because like I said, nothing was changed.\n    submitted by    /u/TheOneTrueZenzyy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please note this a staff facing kiosk not a public facing kiosk.\n Following this tutorial (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/lock-down-windows-10-to-specific-apps). I have managed to set up my Kiosk on a Standard Windows Account. With a seperate Admin Account to manage the PC. In the kiosk when I click on the application it triggers the \"User Account Control\" (UAC) pop up asking for the admin password. \n I have tried the following to bypass this:\n  \nChanging UAC settings in Control Panel to have not notify. This works for the standard account when not in Kiosk Mode. But when I apply the kiosk provisioning package it seems to turn UAC back on. \n Changing the compatibility settings to \"Run as Admin\" for the exe.\n Following (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/app_compatibility_view.html) from Reddit Question (https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/khda06/windows_10_kiosk_mode_running_an_app_with/) I have tried to change this to \"Run as Invoker\". \n Changing the permissions of the folder in which the exe lives in to give standard accounts full permission over that folder.\n  \nAll of these \"fixes\" work when the kiosk account normally but stops working when I apply the kiosk mode.\n This would make sense as the single app kiosk docs say that UAC need to be enabled for it to work (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/kiosk-single-app). I presume this is the same for multi app kiosk mode.\n Essentially is there any way that I can get an application requiring admin privileges running inside a kiosk without\n Or is there another work around.

I’m knees deep in a cloning project for 17 laptops using Clonezilla and I’m wondering why you would use Sysprep in audit mode. \n In my case- all my laptops that are getting imaged are all the same model. \n After I’m done building my reference image, I plan on Sysprepping with /oobe/generalize and shutdown options. (I’ll also make sure I delete the user I’ve been using to install everything and create a new “offline account” to run sysprep so as not to trigger the Windows Store from interfering with Sysprep. Before reboot I’ll clone. \n Let’s say after I sysprep, I realize I forgot a piece of software, or want to tweak a setting. \n Wouldn’t it be just as easy to boot into the oobe, make any changes and sysprep again rather than going into Audit mode? You can sysprep the same image 1001 times now. Perhaps Audit mode was a better option when sysprep was limited to 3 times?\n Looking for an easy explanation of why/when to use Audit mode in sysprep. \n Thanks guys!\n Edit to ask another question:\n Can you unbox a new laptop with an OEM image of Windows 10 , customize then sysprep it? Or do you need to install a Volume Lic version of your own on the new laptop? I have a MAK license.\n    submitted by    /u/javajo91  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got called for the interview, and when I showed up, they immediately said that they needed me on their IT department based on my Resume (10+ years of self employed computer repair experience). I've only done low level repair work, and some minor networking, and I was completely honest about that. Well they hired me as a salaried junior network engineer, and just told me to learn as much as I could, and that they understood that this would be a learning process for me. I've just finished my 90 days and I have had everything dumped on me by my supervisor from configuring firewall rules to setting up domain controllers with nothing more than a \"you'll figure it out\". Thankfully I've been able to handle all the craziness thrown at me, mainly because I'm excellent at troubleshooting, but I've been terrified this whole time, and I'm extremely fearful that I'll mess something important up. I know I'm not qualified to do sysadmin duties just yet, but they're forcing me to do it. I've been made global admin within my first month of being here. Is this just imposter syndrome, and I should keep going and pray for the best, or should I let them know that I'm feeling overwhelmed before I face an issue that could hurt my reputation.

And powershell reports to CSV dont show much change of hard drive space at all. \n For example, over the weekend, 10GB used up. \n Frankly, Im unimpressed with how M365 reports some of this, so I figure there must be a better way, but maybe not.

IBM said they would provide us with technical (hardware & software) support until August (to get support even up until this date has taken direct appeals to IBM for extensions on our support contract). I'm not sure what happened, but that story and timeline has changed to April 30th.\n (I believe it was simply human error on our end, a misread or something, but that is really irrelevant here and now.) \n So, now we are scrambling to find a viable option for hardware support for this interim period (4-6 months) until we've fully switched to a new system. And to be clear, the team that setting up our new system is not equipped to handle support requests that might come in for the existing AS400 system.\n ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND: we are a rather small - I'd like to say almost mom/pop type - manufacturer in Northern New Jersey (Carlstadt, Bergen County). They've used the AS400 for nearly 30/35 years and what little tech expertise we had, has long ago left. I'm a new (~2 years) web designer and developer (and unfortunately, the all around IT person) here and the only person with adequate and competent technical skills. So i've been asked for help with this. \n I'd be happy to answer questions if anyone has any relevant, but I am hoping experts out there might have some solid advice for me on where to start looking.

Just got a job as an It Support which won't include just regular helpdesk tasks but also more and more administrator stuff etc... So there's a few things I wanna ask.\n We're a company of around 60 employees and are expanding pretty fast, so we have to put some more effort on the safety side of things. Right now we have a shared network domain (is this the right term?) Where we have access to the same files etc... Now we'd also like to have a local? domain, where all users would fall under one place and at login you'd have that thing where you can log in to user or into administrator. We also have 4-5 MacOS users. How would that go, to have windows and mac on the same AD? What to use? Co-worker was mentioning LDAP and FREEIPA? I also saw something about NoMAD? Is there a way to have two factor authentication to log-in to windows?\n + when we'd have all of that set up, what would be the best tool to manage everything? Right now we're using Synology I think, for granting access to users for certain files... I also saw something about JAMF?\n ​\n Sorry if all of this is written poorly, as I said, currently my understanding of all off this is not the best, but I'd like to come up with a suggestion or two of \"my own\", if any of you would have a suggestion or two or point me in the right direction, that would be great.\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/42woba  \n [link]   [comments]",

I install office the same way, but on the 2019 host it doesn't seem to ever download the token. When you open office products you are greeted with a \"Sign in to setup office\" you click ok then get \"Activate Office\" At that point it ask for your email. Plug that information in but then it never ask for a password. Then all your office products get the pink banner up top stating \"problem with shared computer licensing\" I looked at the registry entries and those are correct. If I log into the 2016 RDS, activate office then copy one of the tokens. I can log out of the 2016 then come back to the 2019 and the token roams over and office is activated and just fine.

Further to that they use SendGrid for marketing emails.\n I message traced user A- some emails that he sends go to spam.

          "description": "A little background before I ask the question. I have been in IT for over 10 years. At my current job for 7 of that 10. Started as a deskside tech then network admin and as of 4 years ago a sysadmin. My manager at the time saw me doing more than just the network so he wanted to give me a different title as I worked with all the systems. The only way for me to make more than the 5% a year raise is to become a SR sysadmin. We had three SR sysadmins and then me up until 2 years ago when 2 randomly left. I stepped up and became lead on all major projects because I was skilled in many areas. The remaining SR was just apps and that is it. I worked with the Manger at the time to change my title and he wanted to base the requirements off of the past SRs job descriptions. I was ok with this because my skills and projects matched it. Thought I had it in the bag.... then the manager left.... nothing had been finalized or in writing. A new manager has been brought in and believes a SR is based off how many Certificates you have. Nothing is changing his mind. I asked if they would pay for them and he said yes. So I want to brush up on them and just start scheduling. I have had plenty early on to help my growth but they expired. He probably does not believe my talent and I want to hold him to it. Kind of a malicious compliance. Maybe he is trying to save money while under paying me for as long as he can...\n Question: would it become an issue if I started taking one every two weeks? Would is cause me any issues? Like would they question whether I was cheating or not? \n I attend yearly training for any upcoming projects. As an example. When we moved to palo alto firewalls I took a week long boot camp and got certified 4 years ago.(expired in oct) We planned to move to azure. So I took another bootcamp to get ready.

          "description": "Hi everyone. Last year I got a new job as IT Specialist for an engineer company that has grown at an incredibly fast pace in recent years. The biggest problem I’m facing right now is that there is no central management for our endpoints and nobody seems to care: the general mentality in many respects has remained that of the family business.\n Since the company is constantly growing, now we have more than 250 endpoits to manage without an MDM, and most employees have the possibility to work remotely 2 days a week.\n We have mainly Windows 10-11 PCs, a couple of Macs, a dozen iPads and 70 Android phones.\n Is there a way to manage this all in some MDM with software management? \n I looked into intune/endpoint manager since we are already using Microsoft 365 services with hybrid Azure AD join.\n I also need to deploy Autodesk apps (such as Autocad and Revit) on 40% of the Windows devices, and I was wondering if there is an MDM that is better suited for this task.\n Thanks in advance for your help.\n    submitted by    /u/darklink88  \n [link]   [comments]",

Multiple engineers were baffled and threw in the towel.\n Today, I sat down and was determined to figure it out. After 4 hours of analysing event logs and intense Googling, I got it; the file server IP and hostname don't match in DNS. \n The previous tech managing this environment before my company took over had no idea what he was doing. Because of this, there are configurations that at best make no sense, and at worst are dangerous. In this case, the file server had a static IP that's inside a DHCP range, so a client took over its IP causing the mismatch.\n Releasing the IP, extending the exclusion range and recreating the server's A record fixed the issue. I know there are other ways of sorting it, but with the random exclusion ranges already present, this was the safest option.\n It's Friday, I've had a long week, and this took the last bit of energy I had, but man do I feel powerful for figuring it out! \n Just wanted to share this little victory.

When I try to add the MSI I get “Unable to deploy package. The package does not support a Windows compatible platform.” I assume it’s because the server is an x64. I’m trying to deploy settings for some machines running Win11 on M1 Macs in Parallels, and other settings so far are ok. I figured this would be too since the GPO just points the client to the MSI on the network, and it doesn’t actually need to run on the server, but I guess it doesn’t like that it’s an ARM package.\n There’s not some magical checkbox or setting buried somewhere I’m missing to get around this, is there? The x64 version of the same installer works fine.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/RetroactiveRecursion  \n [link]   [comments]",

New chair fixed my wrist pain, but the lumbar support is awful in it. I sat in the chair, for at least 30 minutes before buying, first 3 days this week where good. However, Thursday and today my lower back is in pain. It’s not even 11AM today, and my lower back hurts already.\n I was hoping to return it, and replace it with something better. I know Herman Millers/Steelcase are expensive, but I need something that’s better supporting.\n In anyone’s experience, are those chairs worth the $$$$$? My biggest ask in another new chair are, adjustable arm rests, good lumbar support, comfortable for all day work.\n Thanks for your recommendations!\n    submitted by    /u/SubbiesForLife  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So as I'm reading this release/heads-up from MS about them turning on MFA as the security default in our/everyone's tenant in a couple of weeks, I'm a little concerned.\n I fully understand why they are doing it as a default - just the \"right\" security policy and takes (some) of the liability off of their plate. However, MFA will just simply not work for a lot of our staff. The bulk of our staff don't need multifactor to just open their email. Half of them can't even have their phones out at their desks due to client requirements nor do they have any ability to access email/system outside of the office itself.\n I'm by no means a \"system admin\" (more of a jack of all trades but master of none) but I'm the version of that in our office. I'm assuming that I can reverse this new default setting when MS flips the switch so we stay how we currently are set up - those that require remote access have MFA and those that do require remote access do not have MFA.\n Any help/direction you can provide will help settle my nerves. \n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/jpotrz  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a Java-based utility designed to detect Command and Control (C2) servers using the Netlas API. The tool offers a simple and user-friendly CLI interface for searching C2 servers, leveraging the Netlas API to gather data and process it locally.\n ![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/Q0g0ego8SK97elJvTHN5IXLzs.svg)\n To get started, you'll need a Netlas API key, which you can obtain from the Netlas website. Once you have your API key, you can use the c2detect command to search for servers:\n bash c2detect -t <TARGET_DOMAIN> -p <TARGET_PORT> -s <API_KEY> [-v] \n This project is available on GitHub, and you can find the full README file with detailed usage instructions, Docker support, and a list of supported C2 servers there.\n If you'd like to contribute or have any feedback, please feel free to create a pull request or leave a comment. I hope you find this tool helpful in your sysadmin tasks!\n Happy hunting!\n    submitted by    /u/SuspiciousIsland2682  \n [link]   [comments]",

Up until now we have had a small IT department consisting of four techs who share all responsibilities, from help desk to equipment installs to device configurations to facilities work and vendor support.\n It has been increasingly difficult to manage projects and maintain our infrastructure due to how many hats we wear, the lack of staffing, and the constant interruptions of day to day issues. This has led to us experiencing a cyber attack and the loss of two of our staff due to burnout and the inability to keep up. \n The company has managed to bounce back, but I am not seeing any signs of slowing down and we are still meagerly staffed and I can sense another implosion on the horizon. \n But I’m getting too far ahead of myself. I guess my main question is - how do we structure our IT department as a growing company to assure we are staffed and handling issues correctly? I know we are going to need dedicated help desk staff, network technician, security officer, applications support, a manager, a sys admin, etc. - but what are the actual standards for a company from 300-500 employees? Is four IT staff enough? And what roles should they be divided into?\n I feel we are not organized and divided and staffed correctly, and since our current IT manager has zero IT knowledge, I want to see if I can gather some ideas to float up to higher management to get us the help we need before something major happens again due to lack of coverage/support and high burnout.\n    submitted by    /u/Rocklobster92  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm hoping to get some sage advice. \n I am working for a company that had a 3-man IT department two years ago but experienced rapid growth and are now up to 15 IT folks for 200 end users. There's a lot that needs to get done. We're taking this place from a ma and pa shop to an enterprise-level IT environment from the ground up, and need to do it quickly due to auditing requirements. \n I've been working 12+ hour days every day without a break other than rushing to the restroom, and it's still not enough. My calendar is booked in 15 minute increments for 2-3 weeks out at all times, with more being dropped on my lap every day. My two sysads are junior-level and struggle with most items, so I have to dedicate at least an hour every day to get them in a position to tackle their responsibilities.\n I average 6 meetings a day (my team, my boss, other IT departments, project managers, and vendors), plus project work, ticket escalations, emergency vulnerabilities, and any other random stuff that pops up. I'm stressed. My team is stressed. They keep threatening to quit and so I spend my lunch break every day helping them organize and prioritize and try to make sure they have everything they need. \n I started meeting every 2 weeks with the CTO and my boss to adjust priorities as needed, but it has only helped me to meet due dates rather than be chronically late. He says that they don't have the budget to hire another sysad right now. \n Finding another job isn't an option - I tried, and after applying to nearly 100 jobs I only received two offers for 20k less than I'm making now.\n Please help me. I'm at the end of my rope here. How do you do it? What's the secret?\n    submitted by    /u/octokit  \n [link]   [comments]",

(He has not been in the office so have not done any more troubleshooting with him)\n For the user who wasn’t getting tpm error here’s what I tried -removed account in school/work account setting He was then able to get into office fine. When opening up aria though he was able to open a document, then it would ask for his office email, he entered it, the it would freeze. \n Now, I am not very familiar with Aria (though I believe this is a problem with office) but sometimes if we have a user log back in in our old domain then open Aria and then log back in our new domain Aria works. (It has to populate in the old domain). I go to do that and I get the same license issue with office(no tpm error) try removing account in school/work account setting, still doesn’t work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, removed local file in app date and the launched again. Still nothing. \n Last couple of things -version of office is 16.016130.20394 -both users work fine and have no issues on other PCs + verified they have valid licenses. \n I’ve asked everyone on my team, endless googling and have gotten nowhere. User is getting frustrated so this is my last shot. \n I’m a new help desk tech so please go easy on me if I’m missing something really dumb. Thanks in advanced for any help\n    submitted by    /u/Ill_Concentrate1134  \n [link]   [comments]",

We fall under the Finance dept, so the Finance Director (FD) is our boss, and fills the role of IT Director. He knows nothing about IT, and looks at every issue through \"cost-goggles\" ie. what is the cheapest option and go with that.\n He also doesn't trust either myself or the other IT guy when we tell him information about our systems and what they need. He's extremely micromanaging, to the point that if we change the way the weekly update email is worded, we need to have three meetings with him before we can make the change.\n This is turning more into a rant than a question, but what would you guys recommend we do? I'd love to go to the city manager and say that we need an actual IT Director, but he likely wont listen, and also tell the FD about it, which will make our lives hell. I also can't go to HR, because the HR dept also falls under the FD.\n Any advice is much appreciated, thanks for your time, and have a wonderful Thursday!\n    submitted by    /u/jeagerkinght  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Heres the scenario , small team of 4. I'm on the helpdesk working under the helpdesk lead. Above us is Admin 1 and Admin 2.\n Sysadmin 2 died at my workplace.\n So admin 1 spend a bunch of money to outsources a lot of the security, networking and other maintenance and then tries to spread his projects to me on the helpdesk.\n I really don't want to absorb his projects without compensation and my boss knows this as I explained this to him but he tried to play it off like these projects are easy and don't take much to do and id be getting resume material. Some of them are manageable , as I absorbed handling the security training for our ~400 staff, all aging and in need of basic security knowledge. This alone seems like something worth compensating me for. There are more projects he wants me to do which feels like work i really need to be paid more to do. It requires coordinating with the vendors, purchasing software modules (so far we needed to spend like 12k on software modules for this project....), its expanding our systems capabilities, to me it is really a big project that I basically don't want to do. How do i navigate this fairly? Or what is to be expected here in other workplaces?\n Edit: thank you all for some perspective, my team and i have a good relationship overall. Id be very surprised if they wanted to get rid of me (especially after 1 staff member dying) so i think the best course of action is to rough it out with the project and hopefully secure a promotion in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/Imprettystrong  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a client with a domain controller running on Windows Server 2016. This system was initially upgraded from an old SBS server which got obviously split into a DC and an Exchange Server. While this worked, it still got us stuck with some old domain scheme (I think it’s 2012 now), some old GPOs, settings and more. After a couple of years we’ve moved them to 365 using a hybrid solution for exchange and azure adconnect syncing the computers and users. \n We’re now planning on replacing the local physical servers as they’re pretty old and thought about taking the opportunity to replace the DC server with a fresh DC Windows Server 2023, and ditch the old exchange server (which is basically turned off for quite some time now, but not removed). This will finally give us a clean environment with a updated domain schema, no old exchange servers.\n ​\n My biggest concerns are:\n  \nKeeping the users, data and configurations on O365 and connect it to the new environment.\n \nConnecting the rest of the current servers to the new environment.\n \nWe’re also using Intune so would be nice to keep that working.\n \nKeeping the domain name on O365 and local DC.\n \nMaking the whole transition as smooth as possible.\n \n ​\n Would appreciate any tips and ideas on how to approach this project, I'm sure some of you had to go through something similar.

It also affects all devices, including Yealink, Windows, Android, and iOS, regardless of updating them to the latest Teams version.\n With our call queues operating in conference mode, we have attempted to disable this feature but to no avail.

          "description": "This seems like a fairly straightforward problem, unfortunately we're having trouble coming up with a solution that doesn't seem janky.\n Our scenario: US-east coast based company, Windows 10/11 endpoints, we have a small (6 person) satellite office in Korea.\n None of our end users have local admin permissions on their laptops, so periodically they'll need IT assistance to install applications or install drivers (i.e. printers, etc.).\n For folks in timezones that have business hours overlapping with ours, this is a non-issue - we BOMGAR into their laptops, provide the admin credentials, and Bob's your uncle.\n The challenge we're trying to figure out is how to handle this where business hours don't overlap. We can ask end users to leave their computers turned on, which allows us to BOMGAR in unattended, but per best practices, we have a GPO that locks their computer screen after 15 minutes of inactivity, so up 'til now, we've been asking the end user for their password so we can impersonate them. I hate that we do this as it seems janky AF.\n I know we could always sign in as ourselves on their PC and install the software, but unfortunately a lot of the software we've seen is poorly written and has to be installed as the user account that needs to use it.\n The obvious solution is to tell the company that we need to extend our helpdesk operating hours, or we need to have folks on call to handle this type of issue. The first is a non-starter due to $$, and the second is undesirable because who wants to be on call?\n I'm curious if anyone has come up with a better solution for scenarios like this?\n If Windows had some sort of built-in impersonation functionality that could be used to login as an end user (that was properly restricted and audited), that seems like it could be a solution, but I'm not aware of anything like that existing.\n Is this something a 3rd party login manager like Okta, etc. could help us with?\n    submitted by    /u/vrtigo1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi!\n We have some production servers and would like to change the backup method from push (the servers currently upload the backups it makes to an SFTP server), to PULL, so we have a remote server, which will run Truenas Core, and will pull the backups of the production server.\n This is usually done with Rsync via SSH, but the cybersecurity team is worried that if the backup server gets compromised, the ssh credentials could be used to open a remote shell in the production server.\n The backup server would be really isolated, only accessible via our corporate VPN and to the production server to grab the backups. But still, if a bad actor could get access to the corporate VPN, somehow get the credentials to the backup server, they could get the SSH keys used to do the rsync job and remote into the production server.\n Is there any way we could prevent this? maybe using other kind of software so we don't have to open SSH access between the production and backup servers?\n The production servers are mainly linux but some windows servers aswall. Is there any way a user could be make in linux so not only the user has access to just the backups, but is not able to execute other commands?\n    submitted by    /u/bullerwins  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have five minutes and the company works mainly with OIM, so every listener understands IAM way better then I do. I dont like to talk about stuff that I dont understand fairly well, so I am seeking for a bit of help here to not talk rubbish.\n Im fairly new to IAM and only worked with Active Roles so far and a tiny bit on OIM synchronizing CSV-Files to the system. So my knowledge of OIM is pretty limited. Knowledge about Sailpoint is basically non existent. \n Last year MS launched Entra which includes AAD, a CIEM-Solution, Entra Verified ID and Workload Identities. As far as im aware \"MS Entra Identity Governance\" is also a new component. \n I would like to quickly go through the components and then focus on things Entra does way better or way worse than the the other to products.\n I would like to focus on the connection to other systems (especially On-Prem-Systems), since it looks like this could be a weakspot of MS Entra. Is there anything MS Entra (or Azure AD) cant do and why?\n Lifecycle-Management is also a topic I want to focus on. Looks to me like I am pretty limited to what MS offers out of the box. For example if I create a new Workflow for a Leaver I can put in a step, that a mail is sent to the employees manager, but not to the colleagues. \n Is there anything else MS does greatly or badly on this topic?\n I do greatly appreciate your help girls and guys, since I am really not sure about what to focus on and where the weaknesses of each application are.

The prep is already done, ISO extracted, batch file with all the params created. \n When I manually execute the batch file that basically says \n setup.exe /auto upgrade /DynamicUpdate disable /showoobe none /Telemetry disable\n it asks me for admin credentials and after entering them with 2 clicks it just does the upgrade. When I'm logged in as an admin it just shows the user access control window with Yes / No and does it. But that credential request shouldn't come up for regular users, obviously. \n When I execute this batch file from the deployment service however it just doesn't do anything. The deployment script runs forever and never logs what went wrong. Doesn't matter if I use a silent parameter or not. \n My guess is that the problem is in the context in which the file gets executed. And I have tried all the contexts I could think of. I assume I'm missing a vital part in the logic chain here that prevents me from seeing the solution. \n Further info: The setup.exe and files are hosted on a file share that can be read-accessed by anyone. The batch file is on the deployment repository and gets downloaded to the client PC when executing. \n And I've had a similar issue with a different software deployment tool already when I wanted to put a simple shortcut on the desktop of users on a PC as an admin.

This makes total sense to me, as I have worked with PII before.\n My boss now heard this and thinks, that this will solve all of our problems.\n He told me to create 5 sensitivity labels, for each personnel group of our company. From the CEO to the normal employee. Everyone should get access to documents with a certain sensitivty label, but not others.\n From what he described, he wants a protection, which goes inwards. His example shows, that the he is very wary about his employees.\n No watermarking or data classification. Just encrypt everything and make sure, that no normal employee has access to sensitive documents from his team lead or above.\n This feels wrong to me. I haven't found any example, where Information Protection was used like this. And with that I have a thousand questions and possible outcomes in my mind, because I feel like that it won't stay at 5 labels. In the end I might have to create a label for every project.\n I've seen the quote, that Information Protection are permissions, which move with the documents. But I feel like that my example is a bit \"extreme\".\n Has anybody used this before like this?

Here are a few things, which made me believe i‘m in the wrong movie.\n 1) Gave him access to one 1Password Vault. He didn‘t know what it is (fine, not everyone can know everything) and he said how insecure this is. I asked him, why he came to this conclusion when he didn‘t read the whitepaper and what tool he would choose. Answer: My laptop uses bitlocker, that‘s why i store everything in excel. I asked him what he would do if his devices getting compromised? As long as his device is powered on bitlocker doesn‘t help. Well, if i get compromised it‘s over anyway, a password manager wouldn‘t help. \n 2) he doesn‘t deactivate or remove the local admin account, because he‘s the only one who knows the password anyway.\n 3) he couldn‘t tell the difference between MB and GB/TB.\n 4) he has no clue about linux and has no employee who does and still manages linux machines.\n I needed to vent, cause i always was thinking i‘m still not good enough for a sole sysadmin role to get a job at another company (i did, but struggled long time to do this step) and did know more than a MSP boss with 100s of clients…\n    submitted by    /u/mans3n  \n [link]   [comments]",

When we first started doing this, we used a single gmail account to set up all the devices. However when we got to about 30 devices or so, it started dropping devices. So we created a second account. Same problem, but it was around 20 devices this time. So on so forth, now we have several gmail accounts managing our devices. I cannot find anything online that indicates a limit. MaaS360 doesn't have a limit in our range I know. \n Now I did see that there is a limit to 10 devices per user in MaaS360. One possibility is that we would set up devices for different users, but my supervisor would set up test devices under her name. This would then cause registration issues for subsequent devices.

I also think it was dropping other users devices, not her devices. \n I feel the need to include timeframe here as well, in case things changed.

I work in a company where I am responsible for procuring everything but laptops (phones, chargers, monitors, docking stations, printer maintenance services, VESA mounts, laptop bags, headsets, mice, and keyboards).\n To make things even more complicated, I have to categorize each item properly in SAP so management approves these purchases, attaching the 'price offer' which is often just a screenshot of a price on a website. After that, I have to 'goods movement' them into SAP, attaching the invoice or proof of work.\n This process is causing me a lot of trouble since finance is constantly telling me that the material group, G/L account, or cost center is incorrect, which forces me to recategorize or start the process over. Unfortunately, my colleague already quit due to the frustration, and my boss has not delivered on promised changes to the process. As a result, I'm left alone to handle this mess together with all the IT work.\n This situation is taking up hours of my time daily, and I'm struggling to find a solution. My boss insists that we have to perform these activities and prioritize them, likely because his IT Director reports directly under a Finance director. Procurement says we have to open the Purchase Requisitions, as they can't transform them into Purchase orders themselves due to conflict of interest and policy concerns (although I doubt the legitimacy of this claim).\n I didn't want to vent, but I'm genuinely seeking advice and input from the r/sysadmin community. If any of you have faced similar issues or have any tips, suggestions, or a plan to tackle this problem, please share your thoughts. I'm eager to find a way to streamline this process or at least make it more manageable.\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/chewb  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are also shiney and new and since we are way smaller, I’m well known by everyone, even the C-Suite. They know the names of my wife and kids and always ask about them when they see me. I’m also respected and one of the leaders others seek out. \n The team is siloed into 5 parts at the new place and I will be leading one of the silos but will take part in the other areas. Today, I do all 5 parts and do them well. So I’ll be less focused on those other areas. Also my work load is insanely easy at my current place. I can work 60 hours one week and maybe 40 minutes other weeks. I can come and go as I please at my current place, my boss doesn’t care what I do. The people at my current place are also some of the smartest people I’ve got to work with. And I have known and worked with these people (holy shit this just occurred to me when I did the math) for MORE THAN HALF MY LIFE! \n I’m really torn here. Any thoughts from people who have been in this situation?\n Edit: A couple of the posts here answered the question.

          "description": "We were a bit late to the show on enabling proper DKIM and DMARC policies in our environment, but finally implemented it in our O365 tenant. \n As a result, some vendors that send emails on our behalf (using our domain) have been routing to junk/spam as expected. We have resolved issues with vendors that support DKIM signing and DMARC, however some vendors just flat out don't support it. Before DKIM and DMARC we were able to allow these emails through just with basic mail flow rules.\n Service Fusion for example is a vendor that doesn't seem to support it (https://dmarc.io/source/service-fusion/). How do you deal with these particular vendors? I have suggested to my service manager to use the default domain (as opposed to using our domain), however he's wondering why we can't leave it the way it's always been.\n From his perspective, our \"enhancements\" to our email security are a step backwards for him and his department. He's requesting us to revert our changes (which we're not interested in doing). It seems to me like the obvious way to proceed is to use the out of the box domain instead of trying to spoof our domain without proper DKIM and DMARC, but I was just interested what the community's opinion is on this?\n    submitted by    /u/jake04-20  \n [link]   [comments]",

No Conditional Access available (only using M365 Business Standard).\n The instructions on this page are pretty good and easy to follow. Essentially, I enabled and configured the methods that were being used before in either MFA or SSPR.\n I do have a doubt though. At the end of article, it says:\n  \nFinish the migration \n After you update the Authentication methods policy, go through the legacy MFA, and SSPR policies and remove each authentication method one-by-one. Test and validate the changes for each method.\n  \nSo I followed through and cleared all the methods and saved successfully.\n  \nMFA service settings - screenshots: BEFORE / AFTER\n Password reset | Authentication methods - screenshots: BEFORE / AFTER\n  \n​\n My question is:\n In the new policy (screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/kV4xITt.png ), where is it being defined which methods are available to users willing to self reset their password ?

Currently I run the IT systems years for a small finance company in London (35 people), and I've been there over 6 years now. While I like the variety, challenge and autonomy, things like professional development and training haven't been forthcoming which has left me with no recent professional qualifications.\n My CV currently only lists ITIL Foundation v3 as a professional certification, which is now woefully out of date, but I feel like at least ITIL hasn't changed that much. I have however, made the choice to omit all of MS certifcations from 10 years ago as it really doesn't look great to have things like Server 2008 and SQL 2012 listed given how dated they are now.\n So my question is this, given that my free time is limited like most people, which are the best certifications to get which are fairly short 1-2 day courses and fairly cheap, while also providing good prospects for future roles, and a good line to have on my CV and LinkedIn. Ideally in the realms of cyber security, change management and the Azure Cloud.\n My initial thoughts are\n Cyber Essentials\n ISO 27001\n MS Partner courses in the more advanced areas of Azure Load balancing and cloud server migration.\n Maybe looking into upgrading to ITIL v4\n Change management courses\n ​\n I would love some feedback and suggestions, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/The-Dire-Llama  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all, so I’m trying to figure out this issue. So far a small group of users (2 or 3) are experiencing freezing whenever they receive an email via Outlook or Teams. We’re running M365 with exchange online. The freeze lasts roughly as long as the desktop notification then stops. We switched to M365 roughly 6 months ago, and this issue happened within the past 2 weeks. Now one thing thst happened was thst the feature preview caused the app bar at the bottom of the nav lane to move to the left side. That and us switching to FS Logix to replace roaming profiles are the only real changes that I know of. As far as troubleshooting goes I’ve disabled notifications for anything to show on desktop, rebuilt the local profile, rebuilt the outlook profile, disabled the updated apps bar, and no dice. I have not noticed this on the physical machine, only when removing via Citrix storefront to use RDP, or use the Citrix Desktop. We’re using on prem AD, Citrix VDA to support multiple users to one server, I’m one of the users effected. If anyone has any ideas or needs any clarification I am an open book ask me and I’ll answer.

In the past, if a user needed 100gb or more, in the storage section, the account could be upgraded for an extra amount per month or year. Google has killed off this feature.\n The only way forward is upgrading to Workspace business standard, which gives a 2Tb pooled storage. However, this also doubles the user/month cost, which does not sit well with the board. (Moving the whole business off the Google account is a nightmare I don't really want to face). \n What other external storage options do you guys use? \n Basically external storage, cloud or self hosted, not looking at OneDrive or Dropbox, as I'm hoping there is something that would be possible to integrate with Google drive.\n    submitted by    /u/tikanderoga  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is bad lmao especially since they have the cast there just awkwardly waiting until they can stream it live\n Update 5: 75 minutes in, still down. All influencers are now streaming from their Instagram accounts and it looks like chaos\n Update 6: POSSIBLE FIX: PLAY THE EPISODE 12 AND FAST FORWARD TO THE ENDING. THEN ITLL SAY NEXT EPISODE AND PLAY\n Update 7: Well, it played for about 2 minutes live and then crashed again\n I was able to get in after 86 minutes. Now I can't get in again. Some people are streaming it off their phone on TikTok and IG\n apparently Netflix canceled the live stream and they're just recording it to post later.

This is because these are Microsoft Store Apps that require updates.\n If you're in an air-gapped environment this proves difficult as everything points to GitHub, third party sites, or a license to get an Appx installer for offline networks. It's possible to update these apps but if your workplace is very hard set on risk avoidance instead of remediation you can remove these applications with PowerShell.\n You'll need to utilize the Remove-AppxPackage and Remove-ProvisionedAppxPackage Cmdlet to \"uninstall\" the Appx. \n Nessus showed vulnerabilities for these apps afterwards because the Windows app directory exist for the vulnerable Appx here: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps. You'll need to remove the Directory related to the removed Appx. I've only had luck removing these directories by running as SYSTEM via MECM.\n Something to note, if you remove the WindowsApps Appx Directory before running the PowerShell commands above you will not be able to remove the Appx with PowerShell.\n    submitted by    /u/TheSysAdminInMe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Anyone ever done a Unit4 ERP implementation? What’s your impression of the company? What was the process like?\n Currently I’m the IT person on the project team handling SSO and user provisioning and I can wholeheartedly say that they leave a really bad impression in every possible way so far. Their in-house consultants are absolutely clueless and the processes are archaic. I am just in shock after every meeting.\n  \nYou want SSO? Create a ticket and someone in a completely different time zone will not read your request properly and it will take days to sort things out.\n What does the user status “Parked” and “Terminated” mean? No clue. One “consultant” went so far as to suggest to read F1 help - which of course did not help.\n What should be considered when choosing a user ID? Silence.\n Generally they can maybe answer about 10% of the questions, for the rest they need to ask someone else. Sometimes they even get back to you after that.\n  \nIt’s a bit of a nightmare and other departments engaging with different consultants share that feeling. Curious what your experience is. Or does just every ERP implementation suck?\n    submitted by    /u/Puzzles9193  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Let me say, I am not network smart at all.\n Currently my company advocates for static IP at the printers. We had some printers get moved around and lost their connections. I was told is because the new ports are not on the same subnet. I have no idea what that means but it sounded cool. \n The other thing that is going on, the network guys want to subnet for printers and other collections. This means we have to re-IP all printers.\n I suggested that we us hostnames/FQDN for printers and it was like I was talking about someone religion, or their parents, or the best motor oil. \n It seems to me if we go with a standard host naming convention and connected to those printers via FQDN rather than IP, things would run a lot smoother and the network chasers can re-IP all they want. \n what is/are the best business practices here, short of chaining the printers to the wall?\n    submitted by    /u/rafiki-knows  \n [link]   [comments]",

My user raised a ticket and I investigated. I knew nothing about this vendor of ours besides the domain. I queried the domain registrar for the owner email address and got the private registration proxy one. Armed with this information I fired a quick email to the following addresses about the security incident:\n  \nRegistrar proxy\n abuse@\n security@\n webmaster@\n hostmaster@\n support@ \n  \nThe IT team of the vendor resolved the issue and I got a thank you email from them.\n However, of all these, only the webmaster@ address worked, the rest bounced back.

And you guessed it, no password logs anywhere. I see that there is a process with a serial cable to reset the admin password but it also notes that it erases the data on the system. I have been asked to retrieve some of the data on this unit so I don’t think I should do that. Does anyone know of any other options? \n Also, I cant seem to find any technical documentation on this unit.

In the last 24hrs I’ve been fighting the console along with other menial tasks that come along with the platform. I finally came to terms to just blow the install all away to start fresh again. I’ve been working with WSUS for the last 6yrs now with plenty of headaches I’d like to get rid of. So I’m reaching out to find some other patch management suggestions. We are a small business, I’m sure we can manage about 5k/yr but I’m trying to find something a little lower on the cost side if any. Also, if the solution could inventory the machines and present what patches are needed by machines (similar to WSUS), that would be a bonus.

The link, if you have it, is https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?ref=MessageCenter/:/messages/MC541626 If you don't have it, here are the screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/qVMQxbl\n Basically it's a new feature coming where when you click a link in an email in Outlook on Windows, it opens Edge with a copy of the email as a side panel. Sounds kind of neat.\n But to make sure everyone experiences this, Outlook will also start ignoring your system's default web browser and opening links in Edge no matter what. Users whose default has always been Chrome, and whose bookmarks and saved passwords are all in Chrome, will be highly confused by a very similar-looking browser that has none of their stuff. They'll probably call the helpdesk screaming \"why did you delete all my stuff?!?!\"\n The user can change this in settings, but options being offered for admins to shut this off is lacking. Both options listed (the cloud policy service and group policy) explicitly apply only to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (not business).\n So, for SMBs there seems to be no way out besides manually touching each machine. Of course, it remains to be seen if perhaps the end-user setting is in a registry key instead of some secret place... we can only hope...\n    submitted by    /u/PowerShellGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

We had a different MSP for 10 years but due to some contract negotiation differences, we could not come to an agreement. The new MSP needed Jump boxes in the environment to use as administration systems to work from. \n ​\n They requested 18 boxes 1 for each person. the box requested was a server 2016+ and local admin rights plus rights to have basic administration of DNS, DHCP, etc. We provided the boxes and the accounts. \n ​\n Today (yay Friday!) I happen to refresh my server manager and find a few new ADCS boxes. So I looked at all servers on the network to find what roles were installed. I found many jump boxes had ADCS, ADFS, ADDS, DHCP, DNS, and ADLDS. etc. Many even had LDS instances. \n ​\n I contacted the Helpdesk manager and asked why these servers have these roles installed when they are only meant for jump boxes and they didn't follow the documented change management process. \n He then proceeded to respond \"We needed these so we could administrate these services on the servers,\" I asked him why they didn't use RSAT because installing these roles leaves the environment up to more risks. He seemed surprised at the existence of RSAT. \n ​\n I am very frustrated that the MSP would install and configure critical roles on jump boxes in the environment but I am also Dumbfounded that the basic tools for administration seemed to be unknown to them and it makes me question their knowledge. They to me seem to be a huge risk at this point. \n ​\n Would it be a deal breaker for anyone here? Would you cancel the contract?\n    submitted by    /u/sh4d0w1021  \n [link]   [comments]",

To connect the device to the monitor we had to use a USB C to displayport cable. \n The NUC displays an image when first turned on, but if the monitor is power cycled, the image stays black, and eventually the monitor will go back to sleep since it's not receiving an image. \n I've updated the thunderbolt drivers, the bios, and the VGA drivers in the NUC but nothing seems to work. I've checked the power plan settings on the device as well as adjusting to maximum performance in the BIOS. \n Interesting enough, unlike the other nucs in the room, when you vnc into the device with the monitor off it shows the full 1920x1080 and a monitor connected, while the older nucs revert to 800x600 and no monitor connected. \n Due to the configuration of this room, using the HDMI out of the NUC is currently not an option. My next step will be to order an active HDMI to displayport cable. \n Our NUC10's have no issue using USB-C to DP. I'm Curious if anyone else has any experience with USB-C display out issues with these NUC11 and if you have a solution.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/34orks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope you have a better read only Friday than me ! \n One of our domain controller which is physical computer installed in a other site far away from my office, has no trust relation with our Active Directory, so it’s impossible for us to access it anymore. It happened after a “little” mistake was made. Basically this server is gonna be replaced and we need to clone it and redeploy it on a new VM in our hyperV cluster, for a specific software installed on it. So the clone was done, using disk2vhd cloning C: of that server, and mounted on a new VM, the new vm wasn’t connected with network until the IP was changed, but to change the name of that new VM, it was needed to downgrade the VM from DC to non DC, and to do this it had to be connected to the network, and it’s at that moment where we had the conflict, which made our physical machine loose the trust relationship and removed itself from our AD.\n Has anyone of you an idea on how to make the physical server re join our AD and being able to connect on it ? Beside going physically on site where the server is located which is a 6 hour drive from office.

Checking for updates through any of the apps, it will start to download an apply an update. Once this has completed, M365 is downgraded to the build that was released on March 20th, 16130.20332.\n We're able to manually update back to the latest build by using the C2R updater and referencing the build number: \"C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\ClickToRun\\OfficeC2RClient.exe\" /update user updatetoversion=16.0.16227.20280\n Going through the GUI update process will again downgrade it to 16130.20332.\n Checking our registries, we can see that in HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\ClickToRun\\Configuration, the \"VersionToReport\" key references the latest build. My assumption is that this entry is used when checking for updates.\n So, maybe some funny business at Microsoft's end this morning?

I came across Technitium DNS Server, but I haven't tried it yet and I'm not sure if it meets our requirements.\n Our goal is to scale https://pinggy.io horizontally, and to achieve this, we need a DNS server that can respond to queries with data from a database. Ideally, the DNS server would forward the query to a web API that we will create, and the web API will respond with the DNS response.\n Do you know of any open source DNS servers that can do this? Any recommendations or tips would be greatly appreciated.\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/bishakhghosh_  \n [link]   [comments]",

The core switch and firewall are OSPF neighbors. The core switch is redistributing the OSPF and EIGRP tables into each other. Can I go ahead and safely stand up OSPF between this core switch and all downstream switches without causing routing loops?

They have logs from their Cisco FTD about failed anti-replay checking. I don't really want to get into the specifics on this, since I think the out of order packets is a red herring, but it did get me thinking about what is \"normal\" in these circumstances over the internet.\n I took some packet captures from our router at their branch site. I can see all tunnel packets being forwarded in perfect order ip.id 11, 12, 13, 14 etc. On the remote peer of this tunnel, I can see these tunnel packets arriving ever so slightly out of order intermittently, by about 1-3 packets. So for example, 23, 24, 26, 25 .... then 62, 63, 66, 64, 65. Again, a very low number of packets are actually out of order, something like a few hundred packets out of a capture file that is 100k packets in size. I am using the IPv4 Identification field to count and identify the packets, as our tunnel is a single stream, so I believe this should be valid.\n TLDR; As a UDP flow crosses the internet, is it normal for their to a very, very small amount of re-ordering? There is a lot of different physical media used by providers, carriers to provide transport and connectivity. Also, there LAG's and different speed links, then QoS and queuing.... I'm not too experienced to know what is normal here or not. Anyone that can shed some light here?\n    submitted by    /u/brynx97  \n [link]   [comments]",

And the are right. But some people argue that because of the shallow buffers on those devices they aren't suited for edge routing.\n Same in the data center where I heard people say that the major reason that catalyst switches aren't suited for data center is the fact they have very shallow buffers compared to Nexus or other data center switches. I know for fiberchannel this is a major issue, but for iSCSI this is... not so much an issue. FCoE, the less said the better...\n Is this BS or is there truth in this?

We currently use a vendor who provides us with a service which is awfully useful to us. Without going into incredible detail for the sake of brevity, this service provides us the ability to present our remote cellular routers as existing within the same vnet and from here, we can monitor them with SNMP.\n The reason we do this is because we need to reboot these routers each day, the routers may also be rebooted without warning or reason - and because they are cellular routers, each time they reboot they obtain a new public IP. \n This, therefore, makes it rather hard to simply probe their WAN interfaces. \n Anyway, what I need to do is find away to effectively recreate this service as our vendor is doing away with it - gee thanks! \n I am looking at using an NVA inside of azure - I’m not bothered by the vendor right now, I just need a POC - this NVA will be the VPN headend for our remote routers and I am hoping to present to them a subnet from which we will deploy our sensors to to provide remote monitoring.\n At the moment, I am using a Sonicwall NSv - but I fear I’ve vastly over simplified matters. The testing of my IPsec VPN policy between a remote site and the NVA shows packets coming and going on ports 500, but the ports on 4500 are being dropped somewhere.\n Now this isn’t a tshooting question (I’ve got other posts for that - and yes I’ve enabled NAT-T, IP forwarded on the azure interface, etc etc) \n What this post is asking is, am I looking at the solution correctly? Is a site to cloud solution the best thing to do? We do not have the ability to use on prem equipment - we don’t have our own core network! - so our needs are pretty much all cloud based.\n Anyway long post over - thank you\n    submitted by    /u/Thy_OSRS  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're only 8 months into it so offering to renew the contract doesn't get them excited. What other levers are there to get an ISP to up your throughput at the same or lower price? What else could we offer that they care about?\n Long version: We have two fiber circuits through Spectrum - 1g directly from them and a 100m carrier diverse circuit managed by Spectrum but actually provided by some combination of GTT and Frontier. We reach 90% of our capacity up and down at least once a day so I'd like to get that second connection up to 1g to A) provide more headroom and B) have a viable secondary circuit. If a backhoe finds our sole 1g line, we'd be in for a lot of hurt trying to run the business on the 100m alone.\n But we're only 8 months into our contract. I'd hoped to get better service at a lower price by renewing (I'd originally been led to believe we were half way through our contract) but they're not interested. Is there anything else I can offer them to sweeten the deal in their eyes? All they're offering right now is to increase our throughput on the secondary line with a corresponding cost increase. \n They're also posturing that they resell price they've received from GTT/Frontier is something they have no control over even though the number Spectrum gave me for a 1g Frontier connection is 30% higher than what Frontier quoted me directly.\n    submitted by    /u/cmrcmk  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are in the planning phase for a new school site and looking to establish both LAN infrastructure and a video surveillance system.\n It's worth noting that the regular network traffic at the new K-12 school site (600 students, 100 staff, 250 Chromebooks, 80 Windows laptops ,couple virtualised Windows Servers, 20 printers, 8 MFC, up to 200 smartphones, PBX with a dozen DECT units only for staffrooms) will primarily consist of internet-bound activities utilizing a 1 Gbps symmetric connection. The majority of data transfers will be directed towards the internet, while a smaller portion will be allocated for local traffic, such as printing tasks and access to a limited number of local resources on the file server, if necessary.\n The proposed video surveillance system will comprise 55 PoE cameras, with each camera potentially requiring up to 10 Mb/s bandwidth to the local recording server (total of 550 Mb/s) and monitoring workstation. As we consider the impact on the LAN, we would appreciate any insights or experiences you can share.\n Switches are planned to be stacked and interconnected in a dozen racks connected to the MDF through 10 Gb/s fiber links.\n I am enclosing a rough rack ports count, which includes a full option (all wall ports connected to switches) and a minimum option (all cables connected to patch panels, but only required ports effectively connected to switches, to lower initial number of required switches).\n https://i.ibb.co/kgKRzzH/Screenshot-6.png\n We are curious about determining if dedicated appliances are necessary to effectively manage the network load.

That being said, his VPN Tunnel works just not how I need it to.\n Here's the other problem: His tunnel provides us with a single LAN. Say 10.10.10.1/24 . We are only able to configure a single VLAN based off this, and the remote location needs roughly 10 VLANs. I have asked him to join me in a call with Cisco to see if we can figure out a solution and he says he doesn't have time. \n So yes I know you cannot help me in dealing with this difficult Person , but I was hoping someone could lend some best practice, tips, or advice.

          "description": "In our upcoming school, which is low on budget, we want to offer basic security services to any LAN user, and additionally for students, a web filtering an monitoring facility (keyword catching), which could be served by an appliance such as Smoothwall.\n We're wondering if we can save some money avoiding the yearly cost of a NGFW license bundled to our next potential firewall (Sonicwall or Fortigate), since some hardening can be implemented through good policies adoption, for instance, implementing restrictions through VLANs, GPOs (Group Policy Objects), and application executions whitelisting, which are effective ways to enhance network security without relying on expensive NGFW licenses.\n VLANs: VLANs can be used to isolate different types of traffic, such as guest traffic or IoT devices, from the rest of the network. By creating separate VLANs for different types of traffic, network administrators can apply different security policies to each VLAN to restrict access to sensitive resources and prevent lateral movement between VLANs.\n GPOs: Group Policy Objects can be used to enforce security policies on Windows endpoints. GPOs can be used to restrict access to specific applications, block USB devices, disable unnecessary services, and enable advanced security features such as Windows Defender Firewall and BitLocker.\n Application executions whitelisting: Application executions whitelisting is a security practice that allows only trusted applications to run on a system, while blocking all other applications. This can be done by creating a whitelist of approved applications and preventing any other applications from running. This can help to prevent the execution of malicious software and limit the attack surface of the system.\n Adopting this strategy, one could achieve the same effect as using an NGFW license, but with a more targeted tool for the education world at the same cost.\n Your thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/_ReeX_  \n [link]   [comments]",

But to extend this thought, I would need dual connections from every server (1 to each switch) for storage at least. \n Question 1: For those running dual controller SAN, how far do you extend the redundancy on the storage network side? Do you have both controllers plugged into the same switch? Separate switches? Are servers plugged into both switches? What about regular network for the servers--is it senseless to have redundancy on storage network but not for regular LAN traffic for the servers?\n Question 2: How important is it to separate SAN traffic from other network traffic? VLANs sufficient or are separate switches recommended?\n Question 3: I assume using redundant switches effectively reduces my performance potential as it cuts link aggregation potential in half.

Each blade is identical, with two 10gbe NICs each.\n Each blade has one NIC connected to an external network via a 1GBe switch (slow, but only used for the remote desktop). The second nic is connected to the internal private network with no internet uplink. In the C7000, this is implemented as a physical backplane that allows the interconnect between blades - regardless in the OS this is just a second NIC with no internet access.\n Nic 1 is on 10.66.110.xxx connected to the wider network via the switch. Nic2 is on the private internal network 10.0.0.xxx.\n Currently, if I copy a file from server 1 to server 2, it goes over nic 1 and therefore is throttled to 1GBe by the switch. If I connect from server 2 to server 1 via its internal ip address (ie windows file explorer opened to the network location 10.0.0.1 from server 2) then copy a file to a local directory, it still goes over the nic 1 network via the switch.\n I would obviously love to only have file transfer to occur over the direct connection and get the full 10gbe bandwidth.

In the quagga config (same lo loopback architecture), changing OSPF cost affects routes (as it should). In the frr config, it does not. The router guys can see the cost changes on their route updates when I change quagga configs. They see no route cost changes when I change the frr config. In fact, they have a cost of 0 for ours no matter what I set ours to (10 total, technically, but that includes their default cost for the hop).\n I would expect my configured cost to be picked up by my neighbor, but it is not (for frr).

          "description": "We have dell n2048p switches stacked in our office and every time our yealink phones firmware tries to update the switch kills the port about 30-40% through the process. This occurs if we upgrade via Yealinks servers, our VOIP providers servers or locally through the phones https gui, even on the same subnet as the phone to eliminate the firewall. Our normal configuration is to have an access vlan for pcs and a voip vlan on our user ports, which works as intended. In the logs it shows spanning tree killing the port during the upgrade, however, if I turn spanning tree off on the port in behaves the same way. The only way I can get the upgrade to push through is to change the port to just an access vlan and remove the voice vlan. Has anyone else seen this behavior or have an idea of how to fix it? Changing all of our ports to get a firmware upgrade is not ideal.\n    submitted by    /u/corbrat89  \n [link]   [comments]",

Two distinct networks each with their own respective VLANs would be connected by L3 switches across an MPLS link using only SVIs, so something like a /30 only between the edge switches like so is what I'm presuming. I tried to do this in PacketTracer but couldn't get it to work, so I assume I'm missing something:\n interface GigabitEthernet0/1 description SITE2_EDGE_SW-SITE1_EDGE_SW switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 100 ! interface Vlan100 description SITE2_EDGE_SW ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.252 ! interface Vlan10 description PC_VLAN ip address 10.0.10.0 255.255.255.0 \n Is it possible to simply route traffic from SITE2 that is destined for VLANS at SITE1 across an SVI like this? Normally I would have done this using a non switchport physical interface that I assigned a /30 ip address to Gi0/1 instead of doing it across L2 trunk, but I could easily be missing something obvious. \n Is it possible to route traffic from, say, the PC_VLAN in SITE2 on 10.0.10.0 out through Gi0/1 to a SITE1 VLAN on a different subnet like 10.0.100.0 using a L2 trunk?\n    submitted by    /u/72dragonses  \n [link]   [comments]",

They will never install ACs in every room (and they change the configuration of the rooms almost every time I come back, it’s a Zimbabwean thing).\n So, the internet gets so bad that we can’t even load websites, and while I know they could be doing stuff to help, they’re thinking simply upping from 25 to like 40mbps would do the trick. So I have to ask, how does one determine what is the right amount to purchase? Or is 25mbps actually fine and the bad speeds are only due to the poor planning on their ACs?\n    submitted by    /u/slykido999  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am working on a project that uses a spool of ethernet cable on a modified hose reel which can be wound in and out. One end is connected to a device which reads gas composition and dropped down a hole about 100 feet. The other end is plugged into my laptop where I can view live readings. This connection must be made and the device turned on manually at the surface, before it is dropped, so I cannot unplug the connection to the laptop at any time. \n The problem I have is that while the cable is being unwound and the device lowered down the hole, the cable end going to my laptop is simultaneously spinning/twisting up. If it drops 100 feet, there's suddenly 70 or so windings in my 6 ft of ethernet cable between the laptop and the spool of cable. \n Can you think of any solution to this? I essentially hand wind/spin the cable in the opposite direction 50 times or so every time I connect to the spool so it minimizes the problem but I am looking for an elegant solution. Perhaps some kind of preload spring/spool that keeps it wound in the opposite direction or a special highly-rotatable cable or something. Any ideas would be appreciated! \n Also, any ideas for a powered winch which holds 200 ft of cat7? I've been looking at anchor winches but they only seem to hold 100 ft of .20 rope. Also looking at modifying a harbour freight winch, but I need to solve this current problem of the cable twisting first.\n    submitted by    /u/naturalchorus  \n [link]   [comments]",

In other words, an anti-fragile beast that can stand the test of time.\n To achieve that, we obviously have to follow some steps. Solid configurations, backup policies, physical security, insightful monitoring… etc.\n There’s one big issues, though. I don’t know where to start. I’m capable of learning nonetheless. \n So, my questions (and humble requests) to you, esteemed network engineers, what are some resources I can use to build a strong base for our network? I.e. best practices.\n What are the must have’s, and the good to have’s? Should we just buy every buzzword solution that are out there, or just stick with the essentials and call it a day? But what we can call essential and what we can call superficial? For example, is a NAC solution a must have? What about an IPAM?\n Again, I’m reaching out to the ocean of knowledge that’s you hoping for an answer (or an advice) to some, if not all, of my questions. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Eequal  \n [link]   [comments]",

We used single mode fiber all the way through and installed a second line as a secondary. This was pre existing fiber infrastructure, I just patched things into the adjacent dark fiber patch panels to get from point A to point B. The second building is a new building and the patch panels are new. \n I’m not very well versed in fiber and such but I did do a ping test from switch to switch and got under 1ms responses which I thought was all good. Now Network team conducted a TX/RX optical power test from the switches and found that we’re losing about -10db on the run on both lines and both ways. So right now our RX on both switches is around -13 to -16 db. So my question is, is this normal or is something seriously wrong and what is most likely the cause?

Our network is communicating via cellular to a separate building to view all required devices. We are looking to bring all devices over to one network, however, there seems to be stability issues and due to the nature of the customer, want to keep the networks separated.\n The caveat is that both networks are programmed with the same subnet, so adding a third router will not work. (I know I know)\n As a temporary solution (Again I know), I want to propose the design below to see if it is feasible. It would effectively require the addition of two new routers to a tripple nat'd design. The requirement is that router 1 be able to talk to the devices behind router 2.

Interestingly, when ran arp -a on my windows laptop, the device at .2 was showing a MAC address of a Unifi device, which is also what nmap said. nmap advised port 22 was open on .2 but there were no ports open for a web server. \n When I navigated to the IP address I was presented with the login screen of a Zyxel WAP, which I successfully logged into. \n My working theory is that there are two devices running the same IP and that the laptop has cached the MAC for the Unifi, and as it isn’t running a web server when I navigate to its IP in chrome I am getting the page for the Zyxel. Does that sound correct / plausible?\n If so, I will change the static IP set on the Zyxel and go from there.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Heron_3171  \n [link]   [comments]",

The actual process of configuring the NAT I get, but I'm concerned about the security implications. The portal itself is password protected against AD creds and uses a single port on the host VM server. I don't plan on adding it to our public DNS instead having managed machines access it via link posted on their desktops. Any ACLs I would need to put in place to block other traffic?\n Since locally hosted Exchange servers basically do the same thing, except with published DNS, so I can't imagine there would be too much to consider, but I'd certainly rather be safe than sorry.\n    submitted by    /u/atreus421  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each vDOM has one or more vlan interfaces which carry client LAN, DMZ, DB networks etc, and there’s a WAN interface too. These are all connected to a common edge stack with the necessary vlan IDs allowed on the switchports.\n If we wanted a VM on vlan 101 which is served by FGT pair 1, to access a VM on vlan 201 which is served by pair 2, currently we would set up a vlan interface for vlan 101 on FGT pair 2 with say 10.10.101.253 as the IP, and a static route on pair1 for 10.10.201.0/24 via 10.10.101.253.\n This is starting to get a bit unmanageable and I want to look at setting up dynamic routing acr…",

          "description": "Hey guys, I have a few questions regarding routing and firewall rules with the UDMP and unifi gateway products.\n We have a large 172.30.x.x /17 network with each site having a Ubiquiti UDM-Pro and being allocated a /21 subnet. Our AWS VPC network is 172.31.x.x/16.\n Routing between sites is handled via IPSEC vpn tunnels to a VyOS router in AWS EC2. This facilitates routing between each /21 and the 172.31.x.x networks.\n I am confused about how the firewall rules are supposed to be setup in Unifi network.\n I want to allow all traffic from 172.30.x.x/17 and 172.31.x.x/16 to go in and out of each other UDMP, as well as ping each other's WAN interfaces. I've created a group on each UDMP containing these networks/subnets, to be used to apply to each rule's \"address group\".\n How many rules do I need to apply? and on which interfaces? (WAN OUT, WAN IN, WAN LOCAL, LAN IN, LAN OUT, LAN LOCAL). This is a simple configuration that is made difficult in my head due to all the various directoins and interfaces.\n Next question, there's a radio button to \"don't match on IPSEC traffic\" when creating rules. Do I want this checked or not? All of the connections between sites are IPSEC tunnels, all inter-site traffic will be traversing an IPSEC tunnel. This is made even more confusing with the 3 options:\"Don't match on IPSEC traffic\"\"Match inbound IPSEC traffic\"\"Match inbound non-IPSEC traffic\"\n Any insight would be appreciated. I would appreciate it if only those who have direct experience working with this exact interface would respond. I understand the idea and fundamentals of how this is supposed to work, however when applying rules the outcome isn't as you would expect. So I want to know the \"proper\" or \"intended\" way that these options are supposed to be used. \n    submitted by    /u/whole_sum  \n [link]   [comments]",

To be specific, If we're sending datagram without fragmentation, I wanted to ask in which fields router is going to change their contents?\n I know that (I would post a picture of ip header but I can't) IP header constists vers, hlen, type of service, total length, ident, flags, fragment offset, ttl, type, header checksum, source IP address, destination IP address, IP options, padding and beginning of payload (data). So again, speaking of regular datagram sending without fragmentation, in which fields the content will be changed?\n ​\n Also, what is the difference if we would do that with fragmentation?\n    submitted by    /u/DragonEmpero  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I got this small bit of \"what's best way to implement this\" for a small business.\n There's 3 WAN uplinks, from different providers - main one's fiber, second's through a point to point wifi high speed link and 3rd one is a last resort SIM modem with static IPv4.\n There's no ISP support to run a dynamic protocol on either of the 3.\n R1 must dial a PPPoE connection with auth, then receive static IPv4 on pppoe1 interface. Same for R2. Both can also get a /48 IPv6, but that's for another time. R3 has a static IPv4.\n Magic question here being: what dynamic protocol could be used between each of the 3 \"R\" edge routers and FW1 so that:- 0.0.0.0/0 is redistributed, but removed from advertisements should the PPPoE link fail- order priority remains the same (traffic flows through R1, should that fail, through R2 or - finally - through R3 as last resort)\n Initially thinking running IBGP between FW1 and each R router, but with a default originate, the session will always put 0.0.0.0/0 in the session no matter if the link is up or down, or with a \"redistribute connected route-map X\", with route-map X permitting just interface pppoe1, but I'm pretty sure such advertisement won't include the 0.0.0.0/0 in it.\n Any other alternatives/protocols just for the default route ?\n From a vendor perspective, all items involved - R1,R2,R3,FW1 - are Linux machines (VMs with NICs in passthrough mode), so any dynamic protocol supported by FRRouting is a go.\n LE: for a topology quick view - https://freeimage.host/i/H8L9ZFe\n    submitted by    /u/McScrappinson  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then it got me thinking: what traffic aside from switch-generated traffic (ie: STP, CDP, etc.) wouldn't actually get tagged across a trunk anyway? According to Cisco:\n  \nA switch may also have to send untagged traffic across a trunk link. Untagged traffic is generated by a switch and may also come from legacy devices. The 802.1Q trunk port places untagged traffic on the native VLAN. The native VLAN on a Cisco switch is VLAN 1 (i.e., default VLAN).\n  \nSo lets say a legacy device with a NIC driver that doesn't support VLAN tags is plugged into an Access Port. It sends traffic. An Access Port in a VLAN environment is always going to associate incoming traffic from an end device with a VLAN. To that point, wouldn't the traffic get tagged with that ID as it traverses a trunk port? What is it that's telling the switch to not apply a VLAN ID?

Anything new is usually ephemeral, required only for the duration of the troubleshooting, and generally doesn't have the same \"will this scale\" scrutiny applied. \n I'm struggling to a degree with the Project side of things where you effectively get a wall of text from a Customer (Requirements, Demands, current/future state, Access required) all jumbled up into a little story with a whole heap of pleasantries, and thinking about how I break this down into something I can track, how I can assign or verify certain pieces with other teams, etc. \n Right off the bat, Emails and Tickets are a task at breaking down possibly hundreds of small subtasks and requests into something that can be actioned (Intertwined with spelling/grammar and sometimes confusing sentences). \n How does everyone do it? Do you start with kick-off meetings first, do you try to break down their initial correspondence into something like Trello or Excel and track all of the different points?

With the 30th anniversary approaching, what has shaken out to be the most accepted way of assigning Addresses in an enterprise environment? \n  \nSLAAC + RDNSS\n SLAAC with DHCPv6 for for Domain info\n DHCPv6 with SLAAC only for RA\n  \n(Yes, I know that Android is still not on the DHCPv6 train, but Windows is on the RDNSS train now, so major changes have happened in the last 5 years.)\n I know the NSA has published a document this January with the following:\n \"NSA recommends assigning addresses to hosts via a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) server to mitigate the SLAAC privacy issue. Alternatively, this issue can also be mitigated by using a randomly generated interface ID (RFC 4941 – Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Auto-configuration in IPv6) [1] that changes over time, making it difficult to correlate activity while still allowing network defenders requisite visibility \" \n So how are you guys handling address assignment?\n    submitted by    /u/mpking828  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I can't understand why I can only reach 8Mo/s on this link (downloading a file from home to the office WITHOUT VPN).\n What I can't explain is that the upload speed from the office to a Cloud Server (mega.nz or weTransfer) uses almost the same path but the upload speed is much better ~20+MB/s (and speedtest.net shows ~500Mbps).\n Here's a recap of all the tests I have done so far (no VPN). Know that the speed tests were done with 2 different devices to be sure it's not device related (2 file servers, 2 home office computers in different locations, etc..).\n My only guess so far is that it could be due to MTU / packet fragmentation but I don't see where would this fragmentation happen. Could they have different policies depending on the flow type (TCP established)?

And when I do the upgrade command or create profile command is says error deleted flash:/ then some weird file name that doesn't exist on the router. My supervisor said not to worry about it.

          "description": "I volunteer for a youth organization that has a camp in BFE. Strangely, BFE has FTTH... Anyway, I co-admin the network spread between the various buildings on the property through fiber. Currently, services just include wireless internet, voip phones, and a couple of hardwired printers. Long range, I'd love to add some security cameras, but I need to get buy-in from the professional leadership that own/lead the camp. The network is purposefully flat with no vlans for quick repair and troubleshooting if one of the skilled network admins aren't on site.\n Historically, we've used older Cisco PoE switches (3750, or thereabouts) purchased off of ebay or the random cast-off from corporate donors along with a Cisco cleanair n-wireless controller and APs for wireless. Generally speaking, we only need 8 PoE ports plus a SFP uplink in 99% of our buildings since other than phones and wireless APs, everything is done over wireless.\n The most common failure mode of our switches are power supply failure, either from old age or occasionally poor power conditions. But, obtaining switches to replace a couple every year has been difficult and adding up. The Cisco 3750s are between $60-100 generally on ebay, but I am wondering if there's a better value PoE switch out there that isn't so long in the tooth? Yes, I know $100 or less per switch is really a pretty good deal, but when the budget is $0 and you have a very small pool of people willing to donate money or equipment, it gets demoralizing\n    submitted by    /u/smalltimesysadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sometimes we get the notification that the ftp transfer failed. The client is in a seperate vlan.\n I tried to sniff packets from the ftp client and the only thing I see is TCP Retransmissions of the first SYN packet everytime.\n Then I looked at the port where the ftp server is connected and I see that the TCP Syn Packets are arriving there. Also I can ping other devices on the same vlan during this time but I don't get SYN ACK packets back from the server.\n I see that the ftp server sends \"Who has 192.168.100.254? Tell 192.168.100.250\" then the Gateway responds with \"192.168.100.254 is at 00:09:0f:09:1c:be\". It is like this over and over until you restart the ot ftp device.

The IoT devices are located in two cabinets in each site.\n On the main site, we have a mix of Shelly1's connected via Wi-Fi and Shelly Pro1's connected by cable (RJ45) to the router.\n On the second site we only have Shelly1's, which connect to an access point that is then connected via cable to the router in the main site.\n Technically, most devices connect to the router by cable, rather than Wi-Fi.\n Given we'll be adding more devices (cable only, no Wi-Fi) in the near future, we want something that could handle from 100 to ~200 devices.\n I found related questions here, here and here, but didn't quite help.\n Could you share your experiences in similar scenarios and what you have used?\n I appreciate your time.\n Cheers,\n Q\n    submitted by    /u/quetzyg  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am currently the teammember with the longest employment with just 17 months working here. It was (and still is) a wild ride.\n We currently face the challenge, that our core-switches and a lot of our network switches are extremly old. We also have two networks (one for the city government and one for the schools of the city) with different brands of switches that run together on a single core-switch each. The core-switches are not redundant. It's a bit of a mess.\n One network is currently running on Nortel and Extreme switches, the other one is mainly Aruba and HP. We also use Aruba for our WIFI.\n Out goal is to replace both core-switches, and make both networks run redundantly over both core-switches (still seperated via VLANs). Also, currently nearly all our routing is done by the core-switches instead of the firewall. We want to change that as well.\n We also have to replace a huge amount of our switches over the next year or two. Here we want to choose one brand for both networks, that we stick with in the future.\n Now I am not very deep into the networking side of things (yet). I am normaly more of a sysadmin. That's why I wanted to ask you guys for some recommendations on how to approach this.\n What brands of switch-manifacturers would you recommend? What technologies should I look out for? What should I avoid?\n    submitted by    /u/MasterEnsis  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My understanding of SASE is that clients install an agent that tunnels up to the SASE provider’s cloud, and routes all outbound traffic via this tunnel, where it goes through the provider’s Firewall in said cloud instance, and then egresses from there. To access on-prem company resources, a light weight connector VM is dropped somewhere in the datacenter that tunnels up to the same SASE provider cloud, and acts as a proxy of sorts.\n In theory this eliminates remote access vpn full tunneling into your network.. remote users no longer get a routable IP that can be reached from on-prem, meaning they also can’t reach on-prem resources unless it’s via the “connector” and that can be locked down according to your heart’s content.. meanwhile all traffic destined outside of your network has the benefit of being secured by this cloud firewall.\n My question is, have any of you transitioned to a solution like this as a full-on replacement to traditional remote access vpn? What was your driver in doing so? (Checking a box for zero trust strategy? Eliminating the overhead of managing the remote access vpn infrastructure? (Patching appliances, renewing certificates, keeping client software version current, etc). Because a case study showed this was genuinely more secure than a traditional remote access vpn?)\n My other question os what are the shortcomings? Issues encountered, etc? I’m already thinking of an interactive app we use in our network that probably won’t work with this, since it establishes old school RTP sessions to endpoints.. so any stateful device sees two different sessions, one from endpoint, one to endpoint… I’m skeptical this will successfully traverse the “connector” proxy..\n Any other thoughts? Is this just another marketing fad and it’s really just over glorified “cloud firewall?” Or is this pretty much the future? Maybe I’m completely missing the point on what SASE actually is and why it is? I’m eager to hear your thoughts and opinions on this!\n    submitted by    /u/NetworkDoggie  \n [link]   [comments]",

The cut sheet has no tunnel IPs but when I asked I was referred to the cut sheet. I assumed this meant that I am to use an IP in a provided /28. \n I went ahead with the configuration, created the requisite proposal, policy, keyring, profiles (one for ikev2, one for ipsec), and transform-set. I also configured a tunnel interface and assigned an IP and the aforementioned range. That didn't work so I tried the next, then another, and another. No luck.\n So I asked for a meeting with the third party. Expressed my concern about not having an IP address to assign to the tunnel, it was met with \"well your NAT IPs....\" and he lost me. \n I'm not sure if it's my ignorance or his, but I don't know what to ask or Google at this point. I have read several configuration guides, all referencing an IP assigned to the tunnel. I opened a TAC case and reviewed my configuration with the engineer, their determination, you need an IP assigned to the tunnel. \n My question for the group, have you ever seen a configuration like this?\n    submitted by    /u/HackedSoul  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is essentially mentioned that the traffic will not traverse public internet. But how could that be possible? Because Azure relay is in in an Azure region and on premises data gateway is in our DC. Wouldn’t the traffic between them go through the internet via 443? Are they mentioning that Azure internal traffic doesn’t traverse the public internet and makes use of Azure backbone? I’m really having a hard time wrapping my head around this. Can someone please explain the traffic flow in this scenario. I’ll be highly indebted to you for explaining this.

          "description": "Hi all. I was wondering if I could get some assistance or pointed in the right direction with configuring two sonicwall devices as I am not the most familiar with these devices.\n My network is as follows: I have a set of WAPs that go into an unmanaged switch and into a TZ350 (FW1) on X0 to reach the internet. That works just fine. The private network is currently using 192.168.150.0/24\n We are switching ISPs and there is a NSA2700 (FW2) being added as well. Currently going through X15 on this sonicwall works fine as well.\n The issue that I am having is traffic will not want to flow from one interface to another.\n Right now it is WAP -> Switch -> FW1 -> ISP1\n And what I'm trying to do is WAP -> Switch -> X2 on FW1 -> X3 on FW1 -> x15 (DMZ) FW2 -> ISP2.\n I'm running into issues with getting any sort of traffic incoming on X2 to be shot out X3. I asked this question on spiceworks, but the things that were suggested did not seem to work. And one of the responses also seemed to be generated by chatgpt.\n If I can provide any additional information that would be of assistance, please let me know.\n Regards.\n    submitted by    /u/apks94  \n [link]   [comments]",

Pings during those outages show connection to their sonicwall, gets to the gateway, and then dies out from there. At&t tech says that their connection is just getting over saturated with standard traffic, ran a pcap from their end, and no signs of DDos or anything irregular.\n I ran wireshark from a client machine and saw nothing out of the ordinary other than packets trying to resend during the outages, sonicwall logs show nothing, and during one of the windows when it always dies, I unplugged their network from the at&t circuit, plugged directly into it, and had no issues during that window. Next step is to setup a netflow monitor to PRTG and see what that shows, but just figured I'd bounce the issue on here to get any suggestions. Gut feeling (for whatever that's worth) is that it's an issue on the circuit that I'll have to convince the isp about.

We have all TP-Link managed switches, so I'm planning ahead now.\n So, I go to test them; it boots up just fine and loads the web UI. Just like I'm used to, except this one is super quiet. Then I realize...the fans are off. Not low, they're O-F-F. Is that normal and to be expected? Did I just not notice the others doing this in the din of our \"MDF\"?\n I've seen a few machines running with no fans: I have an EdgeRouter (fan-less) at home and an arsenal of Raspberry Pis. But I've never seen this level of equipment running with no fans.\n So, should I be concerned? Does they need to be repaired or replaced? I'm not in tune with the thermodynamics (heat management) of network equipment. Please advise.\n FWIW, if I put these in production, they could potentially be feeding power to a few SIP phones and IP cameras (max 5W for both devices).\n    submitted by    /u/Aim_Fire_Ready  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our primary site/headquarters is currently single-homed and uses provider-assigned IP addresses, but will soon be multi-homed and our new site will be multi-homed from day one. Each site will be served by local ISPs that do not operate outside their respective regions. We will be getting full BGP tables from each ISP.\n Each site will have unique IPv6/IPv4 prefixes. There will be VPN tunnels between the two sites, but no direct/dedicated connectivity.\n Would there be any advantages to having a separate ASN for each site? Would there be any disadvantages other than additional RIR fees?\n I am aware of something that Cisco calls \"neighbor allow-as\". Would we need to use something like that if the two sites share an ASN, or would the simple fact that they are announcing unique prefixes ensure that their use of a shared ASN doesn't get treated as a BGP loop?\n If it matters, we hope to implement RPKI from the start and we wouldn't want the secondary site to have a ROA (Route Origin Authorization) that would allow it to announce prefixes used by the headquarters or vice versa. (Such as could happen accidentally due to misconfiguration, or if the site were to suffer a security breach.)

Besides the edge switches, the core would have at least one NAS and several Macs, for high-speed media sharing workflows.\n As an unusual architecture, I have zero doubt that /r/networking will love it immediately.

Clearly I don't have 'senior' level experience, but I do interview well, do have some work experience, but most importantly, I have my CCNA and DevNet, along with some network automation projects I listed on my resume (and no, not just simple projects from school. These are my own individual projects). I believe these factors were a massive help in me landing the role (the role said CCNP would be a nice-to-have and that automation experience was a plus).\n Another myth I want to shatter is about applying to jobs 'out of your league'. Again, by all accounts I should not have landed the role as I am only 3.5 months into my full-time career. But clearly there weren't too many eligible candidates and my new employer is deciding to take a chance on me.\n So just apply to any and every job that catches your eye. And there is absolutely no arbitrary 'time' you have to stay at a job before you want to move. I am the proof.\n    submitted by    /u/Prestigious-Shame-36  \n [link]   [comments]",

The two easiest solutions I could come up with are switch it to a PVLAN or setup the host firewalls and just block traffic from the DMZ subnet. Harder solution would be split the VLAN up which would require readdressing the servers.\n Since I don't manage the servers, I think the PVLAN is the best solution I could implement.

I didn't set it up, but the current setup doesn't really make sense to me so I'd like some help understanding.\n The business has two DSL connections. The first one is their internet connection. \n The second one is just creating a secure connection to a remote server that they need to access. The remote server they are accessing is at 100.100.0.1. This DSL modem is expecting a client to connect on port LAN4 at a client IP of 100.50.50.254, with a default gateway of 100.50.50.1. If I connect my laptop to LAN4, assign a static IP of 100.50.50.254, and a default gateway of 100.50.50.1, I can ping 100.100.0.1 no problem. That all makes sense. \n They are using a Cisco RV042G as their primary Router/Firewall. This router has a WAN port and a WAN/DMZ port. Currently it is configured in WAN + DMZ mode. \n The WAN port is connected to their first DSL modem, the modem is in Bridge Mode, and the router is setup to login using PPPoe. All internet traffic is routed through this connection.\n In the settings for the DMZ port, it has the option to select a subnet or range. Subnet is selected, and an IP of 100.50.50.254 is inputted in there. There is then a static route setup for 100.100.0.1, to be routed out the DMZ Interface. \n My understanding is the DMZ port as configured is supposed to be used to give a direct internet connection to a specific device, keeping it seperate from your LAN, and bypassing all firewall rules. \n But how it is being used is more like a dual WAN setup, with no Failover or Load Balancing, but where all internet traffic is routed out one WAN port, and only specific traffic is routed out the second WAN port. \n Can anyone help clear up what is going on here, and what would be the preferred way of setting this up?

We tried to future proof ourselves years ago so we have ample campus bandwidth (small user count, 10G everywhere, DC and user traffic totally separated) so we never had a real reason to try and shoot ourselves in the foot with a bad QoS policy - but now with projects winding down we all collectively decided that now is a good time to take a look at it.\n I've been going through Cisco Live's breakout sessions and am starting to get a grasp, but the whole \"cloud hosted VoIP\" piece is throwing a wrench in my machine. Below are the guidelines that I'm trying to follow:\n  \nMarking DSCP as close to the source as possible - We're moving off of Cisco phones, so part of my testing is to use \"auto qos voice trust\" and see if the DSCP values stick with non-Cisco phones at the access port level, not just uplinks.\n QoS policies in hardware, not software\n Specifically call out VoIP as EF/AF46/COS5\n  \nWhere I'm really lost is the cloud bit. As far as I know, ISPs don't give a toss about your DSCP markings and we aren't peering directly with this cloud service, so while the QoS that we haven't needed before would (well, might if we dont mess it up) work internally, all this work is going to be for nothing if we ship VoIP packets out into the wild internet and they get trampled.\n Is this just part of the known risk when going to a cloud service?

          "description": "Hi all, I was working on new deployment lately, basically a Direct Internet service with a managed Cisco C1111 router configured to provide internet access. The router has Dhcp, NAT etc configured nothing major. However, what I tried recently was creating separate VRFs, one for the Customer and the second for the Management of the router. This was done to ensure to segregation of the routing tables of customer and management. \n Now while deploying I was wondering, what are the pros and cons of creating VRFs in this scenario. What could be the possible downside of creating such a setup ? Appreciate your help and expertise, thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/LilTuffGuy93  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "From what I understand, Mikrotik is the best bang for buck switches. I am looking for a 10/25/100 Gbps capable switch and Mikrotik seems to do all of that and more for very little cost. I don't really need any bell or whistle since we only have a single server rack to make use of this switch. This will be for the backend communication between the servers and backup appliances. Simple config and some vlan. I mainly looking at this to speed up our backup and not to mention this switch cost less than our 1 Gps switch. \n Do the networking community feel this switch is reliable enough for a small office?\n    submitted by    /u/eternelize  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all.\n Not really sure where else to post this. I did post this in r/networkautomation just now. \n I've been going crazy the past few hours trying to fix this. I have a small EVE-NG environment running Cisco IOL and an Ubuntu box on my host machine. My goal is to start studying and writing Ansible playbooks for network automation.\n I CANNOT for the life of me SSH to my Cisco routers. At first it was giving me some Cipher key issues. Then a no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa error. I uncommented a bunch of lines and added some lines in my ~/.ssh/config file as well as my /etc/ssh/ssh_config and also an sshd file I believe (I don't fully recall as I did a bunch of stuff).\n Anyways, i'm at the point now when I try to SSH, I get an error in libcrypto error. I have removed my crypto keys and regenerated them. I had to generate them with a higher length as I was getting an invalid key length. All in all, I cannot SSH to these routers and I don't know why. I'm not the most Linux savvy but I will say I have no issues SSHing from my SecureCRT client on the same host machine. And telnet is a non-issue from my linux box either. It's solely SSH\n Any help would be appreciated because i'd like to move on with my studies and this all hinges on being able to SSH from this linux host box. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/magic9669  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am looking for a router that will be connected to a 10 Gig MPLS circuit. I doubt it will be using close to 10Gig but if that's what they are paying for I don't want the router to be a bottleneck. Was originally looking at Cisco 4461 but even \"performance license\" aggregate throughput is only 3Gbps and \"boost license\" is 7 Gbps but only between built in 1Gbps interfaces. Would like to stay with Cisco but not a deal breaker as it's for a non-profit so don't want to break the bank. Also don't need anything fancy like SD-WAN but need 4 10Gbps interfaces.\n Does anyone have any experience with Cisco C8300-2N2S-4T2X? It has 2 10Gig ports and 2 NIM and 19Gigs of IPv4 forwarding throughput if not using SD-WAN.\n    submitted by    /u/MrouseMrouse  \n [link]   [comments]",
