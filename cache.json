To conduct operations using this tool, the FSB created a covert peer-to-peer (P2P) network of numerous Snake-infected computers worldwide. Many systems in this P2P network serve as relay nodes which route disguised operational traffic to and from Snake implants on the FSB’s ultimate targets. Snake’s custom communications protocols employ encryption and fragmentation for confidentiality and are designed to hamper detection and collection efforts.\nWe have identified Snake infrastructure in over 50 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australi…",

These cards were released a while back by Comtech's AHA Products Group and boasted impressive compression and decompression speeds.I was pretty excited about the potential they could bring to my setup.\n Unfortunately, these cards have reached their end-of-life/end-of-service status and Comtech is unable/unwilling to provide any access to the related software and drivers.I'm in need of:\n  \nLinux, Windows, and Open Solaris reference drivers with source code\n Drivers and Plug-ins for Apache Web Servers\n  \nI was wondering if any of you had experience with these accelerators and might have these resources archived or know where to find them. I understand this is a long shot, but any information or assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n Also, if you've used these accelerators or something similar before, I'd love to hear about your experiences – the good, the bad, and the ugly!\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Gohan472  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n im facing a really strange behavior with Server 2022 and RDP connections.\n Im running on VMWare ESXi 7.0 U2 with Server 2022 Datacenter. The problem occurs randomly on the servers and can be mostly forced by decreasing the hardware of the server to the minimum.\n Once i connect the following screen appears:\n https://imgur.com/a/xH4LtZQ\n checking the logs showing me a strange messages which not occour when the login succeeds. For eg:\n https://imgur.com/a/O1c1scZ\n On several hosts i moreover faced the problem showing a disconnected user using 50% of the CPU. Once i kill the high CPU process the session is killed\n https://imgur.com/a/VdQsxKa\n I appreciate any feedback or ideas to solve the issues. I already tried may things to rule out the problem such as deploying the image from a new clean iso, setting up the vm without domain join etc. Nothing yet helped me the locate the source of the issue.\n Regards\n    submitted by    /u/lufas7  \n [link]   [comments]",

One function of that application is generating PDF reports generated in Crystal Reports from data in an MSSQL database. This is a fully automated process, no interaction required.\n At present the function calls an SQL query, gets a list of reports to generate, then starts generating them one at a time before 'printing' them to a PDF file with the file name changed. This function currently utilises PDF995 which is slow and at times unreliable.\n This application (currently 32-bit written in VB4) is about to get an update to .NET and as part of this transition we want to move away from PDF995 and to something else we can 'print' a PDF to and specify the output file name as part of the process.\n Wondering if anyone here has a similar set up or knows of one, and can recommend a replacement software product. I'm open to anything be it subscription or a once-off, as long as it's regularly maintained and patched. TIA.\n    submitted by    /u/brettfk  \n [link]   [comments]",

This one and the main server are connected to a managed switch and both systems are in the same vlan. We have this setup at two different locations, only using different parts.\n At one of the locations, we discovered that network speed in that vlan slows down drastically when the backup server is shut down. After a lot more testing, we found out that this problem occurs with any NIC that is connected in 10Mb/s mode (tested 3 different systems, turned on and off, and manual 10Mb/s and 1000Mb/s mode, both full and half duplex, same problem every time). It's a KGS-1604 switch from KTI Networks. At the other location, using a TL-SG108E from TP-Link, we couldn't reproduce that behaviour.\n Sure, we could just replace the switch, but we're just some 10th graders from Germany, doing some tech stuff mostly for fun and getting some knowledge in IT along the way, therefore we don't exactly have a lot of budget. Most of our hardware was gifted to us or bought very cheaply from neighbours.\n But even if this is not fixable, we would like to know how this could even be?\n ​\n EDIT: Yeah time to say goodbye to that piece of shit, thanks for your advice guys, guess I learned a lesson today: NOT to buy THAT old hardware, no matter how cheap it is.\n    submitted by    /u/Leonzockt_01  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there, i have a customer with Intune Managed Devices which are connected to a OnPrem Exchange hosted on our end. The problem now is, that as soon as we set a shared Mailbox to auto connect to User Mailboxes the Shared Mailbox connects to the Users Outlook Profile, but than starts requesting a Password even if the user has full access to the Shared Mailbox. If we turn off auto connect for that Shared MB and add it manually to the Users Outlook, there will be no PW request at all. We tried, cleaning old PW locally and also recreated the Outlook Profile without any luck. The same happens also with a non domain/non Intune Managed Private device.

I don't have experience working on a team this big. Which really sucks and shouldn't really be a factor. I have 11 years of IT/sysadmin and web dev experience.\n I've been a jack-of-all-trade type for about 9 years between two companies and my consulting on the side. I also have sales b2b experience for 4 of those years. I know how to pick up systems and processes really quickly and easily. I am currently teaching myself full stack development and cybersecurity concepts (since I want the CISSP by the end of the year). I have always been employed and am a good worker, yet these recruiters treat me like some unemployable person.\n The problem seems to be that I don't have a structured IT career progression and a lot of it is self taught. Mostly because I was the guy the incompetent managers hired to fix things. Yet somehow I am not getting this picture across to recruiters or they don't believe me when I say I work well with others. I know that there is some disconnect between my experience and what companies are looking for. I do believe it is the fact that I have never been in a company that was larger than 500 people. This seems to have hurt me in my job searches. Even though there was diversity, teamwork, irate end users and all that comes with any IT job.\n Is there any advice out there for a sysadmin who is looking to gain exposure to technologies at a large company? I am not dumb and I can handle sysadmin work, but why do the recruiters not want to hire you if you weren't in THAT specific industry?

          "description": "Accounting received a legitimate email from said third-party stating the invoice is due, then a few days go buy and they receive the exact same email again only this time the from email is off 1 letter, for instance instead of accounts.payable@xyzcompanies.com it's accounts.payable[@xyzcompanie.com](mailto:walt.disney@xyzcompanie.com). Everything else is identical, even the email signatures. There was also about 10 other emails copied so at first glance it's not really noticeable. After reply this was followed up by we changed banks, plz see attached for new banking info and then accounting paid it...\n We use o365, mfa is enabled and we even do semi-annual training with knowbe4 to be aware of this type of stuff. Now IT is being asked to investigate but honestly there's not really much we can do from here. The spoofed domain was recently registered and all the mail records are setup correctly so it slipped by all the scanners. Email also had a warning in the body that we add to be cautious as this is coming from outside the company. \n Now we are wondering how a scammer intercepted the communication and was able to phish it. We've seized everyone's laptops that were involved and locked their accounts. So far nothing suspicious, no message rules, no unknown logins, no malware. We are wondering if it's on the vendors end but even if it is I don't think you can really hold them responsible\n I guess this is just a warning to ensure your user base is well-informed about phishing. If anyone has any tips let me know. They are already trying to reverse the transfer but it's been weeks since it went through. They didn't even know until the legit vendor followed up a month later and said the balance was still unpaid. \n Said vendor also isn't a small fry and is a multi-billion dollar global company.

He covered me when I took trips, and was my backup when I needed to bounce ideas or troubleshooting around.\n I, the net and sys admin, do 95% of all IT related tasks, and we lost our low level techs over a year ago, but we positioned in a manor where I can pretty much run the place alone. It's not a lot of work.\n Their isn't enough work for two techs of my skill level IMHO, and the management stuff is signaling that the IT reports, etc of the managerial role can be scaled down. \n So, idk what to recommend to the business, and quite frankly I'm stressed out. Can I run the place myself? Sure. Do I want to do that and never get a free thought to go on vacations unbothered, etc. No. But there isn't enough work for two techs. If I brought someone else on we would be twirling our thumbs and it would turn into a revolving door of techs I'm sure.\n What do I do here? Is an MSP an option? Do they help with windows servers, help desk, and Linux servers? I have zero experience dealing with them.\n Do I hire abother tech and we just shoot the shit most of the day?

One could make the argument that engineer's design and build things as the only requirement to be an engineer, but in that case most people would be a very \"high level\" abstraction of what an engineer used to be, using pre-made tools, or putting pre-constructed \"pieces\" together... whereas engineers create those tools, or new things out of the \"lowest level\" raw material/component... ie, concrete/mortar, pcb/transistor, software via your own packages/vanilla code... ya know\n /rant\n    submitted by    /u/whole_sum  \n [link]   [comments]",

I love the trouble shooting part of my job but the long drives to my work place and the physical wear and tear on my body are starting to beat me down. I have an extremely strong knowledge on anything layer 1 and have been working on passing a JNCIA cert. However I feel that may be a waste of time. I am toying with the idea of reaching out to a recruiter and seeing what they could find me and see if any companies are willing to take on someone like me to train up. \n I was originally a fiber splicer technician working ISP and OSP, until I got my current job. However I feel my current title is very undescriptive of what is expected of me. I work closely with our in house Cloud, Neteng, and syseng teams and have picked up small bits of knowledge along the way. I've attempted to move into the department but management of my department has a hard time working well with others and is seeming to be blocking me. I would love to get work that can be WFH at least part of the time as I now have a one year old and want to be around more than I currently am.

Due to budget constraints, our migration is slow. We have ~80 workstations and started replacing one every month in July of last year. The reason this is relevant is that we are going to have a mix of MacOS and Windows for a while and processes can't just be switched over.\n Here are a few questions that I have and any advice would be greatly appreciated:\n  \nBecause the office is primarily Mac-based, domain administration tools (AD, GPO, etc.) have never really played a major role except for email (on-prem Exchange server). This gives me the perfect opportunity to rework the domain setup to my liking regarding policies and organization. How have you approached this in the past? \n \nSome of our users have only ever worked on a Mac so they would need training right from the basics on working with Windows. How have you handled user training on the new OS? Are there any good user guides out there that cover Windows 11 from the basics and would be easy to navigate for tech-illiterate users? \n \nDue to the sometimes huge process changes, I find that a lot of users will try to tweak the new processes to emulate their MacOS experience, often making their Windows experience a lot more complicated and increasing frustration. How have you helped users adopt new processes and help them see that the new processes, although different, are more efficient and will make it easier for them to do their job?\n \n I know this is a pretty lengthy post, but I really appreciate any responses to my above questions.\n    submitted by    /u/Altus-  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now we are 4 employees (including me). \n The situation at the workplace\n I am focusing on everything IT-related. They have set up a domain network with 4 windows machines and one windows 2012 R2 server. The employees login through the domain meaning its dependent on the server to work. \n - Every employee has access to the other employees computer (except for mine)\n As some of you know Windows Server 2012 R2 is about to reach its end of life and so does the software we run on it. \n ​\n Suggestions needed\n Why even bother logging in through a domain at all? Why cant I just setup each computer individually with local accounts? Going with a server is just overkill and its just consuming alot of power (and is also getting very warm in my office). The software that the server is providing with the other users basically just needs a visible-over-network folder. Meaning I can just \"share\" a folder in the network with a smaller, not so hot running but modern computer running windows 10 and just share the folder with the other windows 10 machines. \n I think the server solution for us is just too much work and pointless in our current situation. Are there any concerns about turning the logins of my employees into local accounts?\n I didnt know who to turn to and reading this reddit has helped and inspired me alot for my workplace and I really hope it fits with what the community is about\n    submitted by    /u/PrinceHeinrich  \n [link]   [comments]",

But neither currently support sending out either SMS or phone call alerts to an on-call engineer (and we can't wait to see if they are building it). If everything else was A+ I would accept app/push notifications, but using the mobile phone network is first choice.\n The reason I bring up those existing systems is because a lot of tools out there (PagerDuty, BetterUptime etc) cover a lot of the same bases as well as the on-call alerting, so we'd be paying a fair chunk of change for features we have no intention of using. I saw a recent blog post about PagerDuty alternatives, but from my reading many of the listed products are covering the incident management portion (like incident.io), but missing the actual alerting via SMS or phone call (out of hours, when we can't expect engineers to be paying attention to the work Slack).\n This needs to be a SaaS solution, because we want to be able to alert in the case that our entire platform on which all our own stuff is hosted is having issues. Given that we're entirely in AWS currently it also shouldn't go down if AWS has issues.\n What products are other people using? Would you particularly recommend or warn against using it, or is it just 'good enough'?

Unfortunately, the project got stuck due to platform issues, and no one seemed proactive in resolving them or assigning me other meaningful tasks.\n A few weeks ago, I approached my manager to express my concerns about th…",

The direction is currently to deploy a MS Team to each department and then use the underlying Sharepoint site that is created automatically for that Team and customize it as their department Sharepoint site. So the department would be able to use the MS Team for Teams functions and open/link to the Sharepoint side underneath for all their departments Sharepoint needs. The Sharepoint would have permissions customized for different libraries and would also have things like Meta tags customized, etc. \n Here is the kicker. Every event, training and MS rep I have ever spoken with has said the cardinal rule of Teams is you do not make customizations to the Sharepoint underlying a MS Team It is more of the engine underneath and you use Teams to drive the car; however, a new vendor we deal with contradicted that and said it is fine and using the underlying Sharepoint is the way to go. So I am doing somewhat of a sanity check. \n So I am trying to crowdsource some real world examples of if/when this will cause issues. My opinion is we should be spinning up a separate Sharepoint site for each department but if I am wrong I would like to know know as well so I can grow. \n I did some searching but couldn't find many concrete ways that utilizing and customizing the underlying Sharepoint site for a MS Team would cause issues/break things but I wanted to do my due diligence before we set out down this path if it is the wrong path.\n So I thought I would reach out to the community and see what everyone thought. \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/FinalSysAdmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I am working on AD/Group Policy cleanup and organization and I've come across a few GPOs that are extended to our child domains.\n This is a bit new to me since the last two environments I worked out of did not follow this practice and would re-create the same GPO for each child domain.\n IE, If the parent root domain has a GPO for specific server configurations, that same GPO is re-created in each domain within the forest. A fairly manual task but leads to the creation of the GPO settings locally on the DC of that child domain.\n Now, I'm working with multiple GPOs that are extended, which is nice but I'm not entirely sure if it's ideal. I can't recall where I have read that this is bad practice and I can't narrow down why but I came across this Microsoft AD Design Considerations and Best Practices article that indicates it's a normal thing to do.\n AD: Design Considerations and Best Practices\n Based on the Microsoft article and it being semi-recently updated, I'm assuming that extending GPOs across domains is a normal practice?\n I'm more curious about the performance impact.\n On one of my child domains, I search my sysvol\\child.domain\\policies folder for a UniqueID of a GPO that is extended and I do not find it. This means that the computers need to reach out to the parent root domain for that policy, correct?\n While when I search for a locally created GPO UniqueID within the child.domain\\policies folder, I find it obviously. \n ​\n Any ideas or thoughts on this approach in managing GPOs on multiple domains within the same forest?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/N01kyz  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only thing that changed on their system was a forced W11 update (not my decision). Whenever a user opens a folder on the shared drive, it's extremely slow and crashes Explorer.exe after that, or it hangs in the \"Not Responding\" state. This behavior is present while in the office or with a VPN from their home network. This issue is not present for everyone, only for a handful of users.\n What I've checked and done:\n  \nChecked that network speeds are fine -> Everyone is getting 100+ Mbps up and down.\n \nChecked that system uptime is not crazy high.\n \nSFC and DISM returned no issues.\n \nCleared Explorer cache\n \nMade explorer run each window as a separate process.\n \nAll Windows updates are installed.\n \nAll \"Lenovo System Updates\" are installed.\n \nUnmapped all drives and remapped them again.\n \nMade sure that Defender are not scanning the network drives.\n \n The only thing that I've found out so far is that unmapping the drives fixes Explorer's slow speeds and crashes. These users rely heavily on these drives for their everyday work (Sharepoint migration is in the works but isn't going to be done soon).\n At this point I'm kinda out of ideas, can't even find anything to try.

I can only revert to the snapshot.\n When I revert to the snapshot I can work inside the VM until the crash happens again.\n It seems that before the crash there are no error logs in the Event Viewer.\n I think it could be the software installed inside this VM that triggers the crash but I cannot get proof.\n  \nEDIT\n  \nI created a local user joined to local admin group\n I was able to log in after the network crash\n I can see that under Control Panel there are no network cards, it does not matter how many network cards I add from VMware ESXi\n It seems like a driver issue, in Device Management I see a lot of unknown devices with warnings \n  \nAny ideas?\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/sbiriguda666  \n [link]   [comments]",

Take a standard Windows 10 Pro OS for example. If the BIOS isn't locked by a password, you just enter it and boot into a USB drive containing a Windows Password Recovery software and bam, you got access to the admin account since now you got the password to it. If the BIOS IS locked with a password, then you take out the CMOS for a minute, put it back in, now the BIOS has been reset and you can enter it again without any password, and now rinse and repeat what I've said earlier. If Bitlocker Pre-boot PIN is enabled, then you can just crack Bitlocker with a software like John The Ripper (but that's way more complicated than just using the software itself, there's many extra steps to it and it can take hours even, but I'm not going into that coz that'd take too much time and space). So Bitlocker doesn't protect someone from knowledgeable people like IT forensics (working for the police), a BIOS password also doesn't.

          "description": "We are a Windows shop with about 4000 endpoints using SCCM. I needed to push out a .exe we received from a vendor (which puts files in the user’s AppData folder) to clients with a silent switch. I created a PS script to copy the .exe to the machine, run install and put a validation file on the C:/folder so SCCM can figure out if it has run or not. If I manually ‘Run Script’ for that machine it will work fine. I created a package to be able to create a schedule/required install and it always prompts for elevation when the endpoint tries to run the script. If I take that same script and copy it to the endpoint and try run it, it won’t run because the script is not remote signed. I am unable to set the execution to unsigned or bypass because we have the GPO set to only allow local scripts and remote signed. I’ve tried this as a domain admin and get the same result. We also have used the PSAppDeploy scripts before with no issue and those have stopped working too. I’m quite certain that the -bypass in the script is not working now either when it tries to run. We have been running this same setup for years and have not had this issue before. There is one code sign cert on the endpoints from ‘Microsoft’ that did expire a couple weeks ago but I don’t know where that came from or how to renew it. All the certs on the SCCM server are valid (but none of them are a code sign cert). We do have a CA and I’ve tried to create a code sign cert to push but I haven’t gotten that working yet. Any ideas as to why this would all of a sudden be an issue or how I can get this working?\n    submitted by    /u/GeekFarm02  \n [link]   [comments]",

Bring my Dell laptop, install a copy of Windows into portable SSD and add it to authorized device to access company resources.\n Pro is I think the company control for personal device is less than corporate issued device, or at least they claim it to be.\n Concern is my personal data will be in the internal SSD and they may scan it if I boot from portable SSD and not remove the internal SSD.\n 3.

In addition, we're starting to see the format pop up more often with remote folks sending in photos of forms with PII on them, so online converters are completely out of the question. \n Any help or ideas would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/pointlessone  \n [link]   [comments]",

Perhaps I'm suffering from working in a small company (just 100 endpoints), so maybe the products are better than my experiences so far.\n We are with Cybereason, currently on NGAV but due to replace with EDR in September. The support has been awful. For example, Cybereason is currently detecting itself (coreminion.dll) as being Malware (https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/). But only on one machine. I've seen other examples of legit software flagged on a handful of our endpoints, but not on most. It's just so wildly inconsistent, despite everything being in the same policy group, updated, and so on.\n Crowdstrike - looked promising, but awful sales experience. I've been blunt about how our purchasing decisions are made (we have an annual budget - if it isn't in that, it's not happening) and given windows when it's good to speak (i.e. two months before I confirm my budget for next year!). This doesn't stop me being harassed by calls and emails, including one rather embarrassing \"My manager said I'm in trouble for giving you this price, but I can honour it if you buy now!\" call.\n Watchguard - support was absolutely appalling, and their Panda EDR client trashed our Linux laptops.\n So, two questions:\n  \nHave I just been unfortunate with Cybereason - are those on the EDR or MDR solution finding a more pleasant time. What is your feedback?\n Are AV providers just shitty, or is it because we're such a small account? Would we be better using a MSSP?

What 'sometimes' works is\n ​\n  \nConnect-ExchangeOnline\n  \nConnect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName <your UPN> * New-ComplianceSearch -name \"suspicious emails\" -ExchangeLocation all -ContentMatchQuery 'subject:\"suspicious\"' * Start-ComplianceSearch “suspicious emails” * New-ComplianceSearchAction -SearchName “suspicious emails” -purge -purgetype SoftDelete/HardDelete\n This is cumbersome and does not always complete due to powershell errors and/or our team rushing to get it done fast. Last night it would not accept the 'purge' argument for reasons I did not determine. I also need to set the security to \"winrm basic\" to run this and then change it back again when done.\n reference https://www.codetwo.com/admins-blog/new-compliancesearch-new-version-of-search-mailbox/\n I am also trying to delete from Trace \\ go hunt for this message\" \\ \"advanced hunting\" and though I find the mail and take action to delete it, it does not appear to delete.\n What I am looking for is to the fastest way, ideally through the GUI, to locate all mails from a sender and /or subject and delete.\n Thx!\n    submitted by    /u/bjc1960  \n [link]   [comments]",

Straight up no, just drop the topic.\n b) Deadline is set. There is some serious $$ involved and I'm sure they would rather fail partly and fix it after the deadline.. but that would be my problem to fix later on , while they will put the blame one someone else. \n Another idea was to persuade most of project members to my ideas, but that takes time, which is running out. My question is how do you find a workaround in those situations and go with how you propose? \n P.S. and please, no \"CY@/leave as see what they do\", cause in the end, when the milk was already spilled and you get the blame or bad looks it's already too late, since there seems to be distrust whether you are capable of working on bigger projects..\n    submitted by    /u/Margosiowe  \n [link]   [comments]",

Forgive me my broken English also.\n Due to organizational matter, In my company we need to see/list in udadmin into our license server only the devices connected, not the users. Surfing for days around the net I understand that it probably depends on the License Type and on how are installed.\n The strange thing is that a couple of those device we have are already listed like this and they connect/show as device (thin clients) without listing the username as well. For the rest we use also windows laptops as well so we have a mix. We own a Citrix On-Prem server where the employees connect to their desktop via ICA/Receiver.\n Is there a way to re-install the license and associate it per device and not per user on the physical machine? Any hints? Citrix Inc. seems like to be very conservative and limited about it, and I couldn’t find much around the net.\n Thank you! 😊\n    submitted by    /u/Juggernaut_911  \n [link]   [comments]",

Looking back I was glad to have been there \"during the good times\" and was sad to see newer, younger coworkers not even have the frame of reference to understand just how much they were getting screwed and commoditized despite not actually being commodities. \n In hindsight some of the primary reasons the company got away with it was their \"thousand small cuts over time\" approach, and the total failure of employees, especially the older and more senior ones, to collectively push back in an organized fashion. I'm not saying to Unionize (and I'm not saying not to, either), but it's clear that todays Fortune 500 companies operate under the exploit and push until something breaks model of staffing and operations, just as they do with most everything else. And if you're quiet and kill yourself to make moving that goalpost successful for the company, then it will probably be at your expense.\n    submitted by    /u/systemfrown  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I'm playing around with PKI (mostly mostly client auth/sign), but I think a relatable example that most sysadmins will get is PKI use for S/MIME.\n Yes, you can pay $50/email address to some certificate authority, but many will also roll out their own PKI. It all depends on the use case of course, do you just need non-repudiation for internal use, or do you want outside recipients to verify emails.\n But it's 2023. Let's Encrypt lets you get DV certificates for free, but those certificates only support TLS server/client authentication EKUs.\n Why can't we have free validated S/MIME certificates (and other types of certificates)?\n Why can't we have our own CA for a domain, and have our \"local root\" signed by a \"real\" CA just like any other intermediate CA, so we can generate our own certificates that work on our own domains? Servers would need to also serve intermediate certificates that are under our control so the chain can be fully built since those links are missing in browser/computer root stores, but that's just a few extra bytes.\n    submitted by    /u/zachlab  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've had to turn off noise filtering a little while ago in teams to make it usable during long meetings. I have an email trail since November asking for a new laptop screen and dock stating the reasons and its been stalled ever since, every meeting catchup with manager there's a different excuse or blame on the further delayed merger talks. Latest is I've got a complaint on background noise in meetings which I argued I can't switch on teams noise filtering due to ongoing cpu usage. Told to move my office at home or tell my family to be more quiet. I'm at my wits end and looking for a new role as my boss is a cow.

The email SME did his research- it was Exchange- no external email. Someone internally email an attachment to a DL and none of those people in the DL claimed they received it, but mail flow and Exchange Reporter said they did. We were able to show who sent the message and when it was received by all the people in the DL which are internal as well.\n Fast forward to today and that department is sticking to it’s guns that the company email system messed up and the email just “disappeared”\n Really?! FFS are users this dumb? Not one but FOUR in the DL? What more do you want I thought? I was told by my leadership to find hard proof the message was there. So I did.\n I gave my adm account access to the mailboxes and logged into each one and found the message. The person causing the most stink- I found the message in their recover deleted items and it had been deleted four minutes after it was received.\n Now the department is blaming us because the file doesn’t have the right content- sorry that is not even remotely the IT department’s responsibility- please find another way to spin it how you f**ked up and don’t blame IT!\n    submitted by    /u/CaptainZhon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found where I can access these labels, but they are greyed out under Azure Information Protection. What we also noticed is that in the Outlook Preview the two labels don't exist. However this will take a good few months before this version will even be rolled out. Can anyone provide me with some support on how to get rid of the two labels in question?

We tried it from both sides and its the same issue. Did the direct connect mess up somehow? is it a onedrive app issue? We tried all the usual stuff like reinstalling the onedrive app to the latest version, cleaning the cache, even new installs of windows, we tried different users and new/old groups/channels.

To streamline this process, I've put together a PowerShell script that automates it.\n Here's an overview of the script's functions:\n Creates an MDM Key: The script generates an MDM key if it doesn't already exist.\n Enables Automatic MDM Enrollment: It sets up automatic MDM enrollment using Azure AD credentials.\n Generates Necessary Registry Keys: These keys are essential for the enrollment process.\n Initiates Group Policy Update: It forces a group policy update using the gpupdate /force command.\n Defines Enrollment URLs: The script assigns the required MDM enrollment URLs.\n Automates Device Enrollment: It calls upon deviceenroller.exe to automatically enroll the device in MDM.\n You can find the full script here: https://github.com/fKryptek/Intune/blob/main/EnrollToIntune.ps1\n As with any script you find online, I highly recommend reviewing it, tailoring it to your needs, and testing it within a controlled environment before deploying it on a larger scale.\n I'm interested in hearing about your experiences with the script, as well as any modifications or improvements you might suggest. If you encounter any problems or have questions, please let me know.\n Looking forward to your feedback.\n If you'd like to buy me a coffee for my efforts : https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bobbyhalford\n P.S.: Keep in mind, the effectiveness of this script may vary based on your Azure AD and Intune setup.

One open and hotly discussed point is the logging issue.I am a big friend of \"GrayLog\" which we have been using for a long time in the free version. However, our IT security officer says that a protection against manipulation of the log events cannot be guaranteed. The product variant \"GRAYLOG SECURITY\" would fulfill this requirement, but due to the licensing of the complete Elasticsearch stack with the machine learning features and the \"top-notch-enterprise\" requirements on the base system (Oracle DB etc.) this is unfortunately too expensive for us.I found this method on the net to write a signature in each event and validate it again on readout (https://community.graylog.org/t/graylog-for-integrity-log-hashing/15570), however this is obviously not enough as a user with admin rights could easily manipulate these hashes.Has anyone ever done the GRAYLOG FREE task as ISO/IEC 27001 compliant logging and can give me some hints on how to implement this?\n    submitted by    /u/andschdotnet  \n [link]   [comments]",

The users have relatively low bandwidth usage, they mainly use SharePoint for Word and Excel collaboration, possibly some infrequent Teams calls. \n We've had quotes in the past for installing leased lines (far too expensive and takes far too long for the cable to be laid; 3-6 months for a 12 month project) \n Basically, we've tested StarLink (the standard residential edition) and it's an absolute godsend. It's relieved such a massive headache for the onsite user and from me from a sysadmin perspective. \n We don't need the business edition, it's far too expensive (£2400 for the kit and £240 p/m) and we don't need the bandwidth or speeds. It's literally 1 person in a cabin working from 1 PC...\n Should we continue down this road or do you think we could encounter issues in the future using the residential service?

I had a lot of private messages sent to me asking how to help but haven’t been able to post till now. \n I have been in IT officially for about 6 years now and after I had one foster child who kept punching my laptop when he got mad at a game, I thought that maybe other foster families had this same issue and needed a repaired laptop or a laptop for the kids. I worked with my office building and started collecting any desktop/laptops that were in the basement Tom be recycled, made about 100 systems - then the pandemic hit and the demand went up. \n I’ve been able to rebuild about 400+ laptops on my own (windows, Mac, a few Ubuntu set ups) and distribute them - but we’re running low and the need keeps growing. \n If anyone wants to unload systems for tax credit through a registered 501c3, we can accept donations and send you a blank form for tax write offs, and even make a post thanking you on linked in for free marketing. The goal is that you and your company win, and the kids win. \n Though I expose my identity a bit doing this, here is a LinkedIn link where you can search the history of this charity I run and who I partner with to know it’s legit. \n https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timlindow_denverbusiness-itadmin-itservices-activity-7043686634428530688-hFTT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios\n No pressure, but if you can help, there are lots of foster kids and families in our area who could use these!\n    submitted by    /u/Just-one-more-Dad  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a systems admin for a medium-sized org, and not super familiar with AWS, but wanting to know actual best practices for the scenario below. Please forgive the inexperience behind the question:\n Basically, our Dev team is moving a lot of dependencies for their apps away from local resources and more into our cloud environment. Currently, our media team writes directly to an on-prem FTP server and the dev team pulls the data from the FTP server and loads it into an S3 bucket. We have an application that pulls the content from the S3 bucket (as far as I'm aware). \n Our lead dev asked if there was a way to connect our local network to an S3 bucket in AWS so that we can have our media team write their stuff directly to the S3 bucket rather than the local FTP server. I'm more familiar with Azure, so I had to do some digging as to how to make this happen. My initial thought is setting up a VPN to our VPC in AWS, but I may be way off on that. However, our IT Director is on an 8-week leave, and from a strategy perspective, I'm not sure if I'm the right person to make the call, as I'm still fairly new to the org.\n From what I've researched, there is a way to mount an S3 bucket to a local Linux server. My understanding is that the local host would act as a proxy that would eliminate the need to manually move the content into the S3 bucket.\n Am I off on this? For those who have had a similar scenario, could you please share what you did? Telling the dev team to kick rocks until our director gets back to have a more broad design discussion is not out of the question, but I figured I would do my homework before I did so.\n    submitted by    /u/mxbrpe  \n [link]   [comments]",

The overall company environment isn’t completely horrible but it is severely lacking( the people are nice). Overall the lack of job motivation has also pushed into my self learning. In my previous role, I always had the urge to self learn to stay on top of the environment I was working on.\n I feel like I’m stuck in this role. In the past few months I have had overall positive interviews but no bites. Usually because my clearance is still processing or lacked skill in one area leaving me has the “silver trophy winner”.\n Tl;dr: Current role I lost all motivation, but feel like I’m stuck\n    submitted by    /u/Character-Goose4258  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think it's also causing satellites to inexplicably stop working every few months until they're restarted.\n Is there any 6E mesh system which doesn't mind if the nodes can't talk to each other over wifi? I'd really have expected just being on the same wired LAN would have been okay with the Orbi but no such luck. I don't really mind if it's consumer, the Orbi experience is very consumer despite being marketed to businesses.

We had the issue this morning with someone who didn't have access since we couldn't properly re-inherit the permissions to the subfolders.\n The issue was that some folders were owned by User A, Creator of some subfolders, and not by User B, Owner of the Main shared folder.\n Normally it looks something like this. See picture below.\n Imgur Picture\n In my experience the Owner usually is the local Administrator or the group \"Domain Admin\". For now we have put \"Domain Users\" and we have added each user (not like on the picture) manually. Meaning that we don't yet work with an AD group that gets assigned to each user for access instead of each user is manually added.\n So my question is the following. Is it ok to leave \"Domain Users\" as owners or should be put \"Domain Admins\"? Is it maybe a security issue or cause other problems? It's been years since I've done it myself and I don't remember who I put as owner on those cases.\n    submitted by    /u/VarmintLP  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have tested this heavily, let's say we have three outbound spam policies:\n ​\n - No Send Limit (Unlimited)\n - Test Send Limit (5)\n - Default Policy (500)\n ​\n 1) Scoped a user to policy \"Test Send Limit\" and sent out 50 mails. User was restricted from sending in the Security Portal and an alert was triggered. But mails could be sent out half a day later without problems and the user was still blocked in the portal.\n 2) Scoped a user to policy \"No Send Limit\". Multiple days passed, so enough time was given for the policy to be active in M365. Suddenly, user was restricted after sending out 500 mails as if the default policy applied. This can never be because the default policy has the lowest priority and therefore explicit policies always take precedence.\n ​\n This was raised as a ticket at Microsoft and escalated and I did supply them lots of information over multiple weeks. I never got the resolution to the problem and at some point they just stopped answering my mails.\n    submitted by    /u/Impressive_Log_1311  \n [link]   [comments]",

The project was assigned to me recently, and we have a tight timeline of just 2 months to complete the transition. \n However, the company has historically been resistant to change, and some executives have already expressed concerns about the switch. As a relatively new member of the company, I don't have much experience with Slack, but I've been entrusted with leading this transition.\n While I believe that people just need time to adjust to the new system, I wanted to reach out to the community for advice. \n Are there any important considerations or potential challenges I should be aware of during this transition period? My goal is to ensure a seamless migration and minimize any disruptions to our workflow.\n Additionally, I'm curious to learn about the similarities and differences in features between Teams and Slack. Are there any features that exist in both platforms? Furthermore, I'd greatly appreciate any insights into unique features offered by Slack that may not be available in Teams.\n Thank you in advance for your guidance and insights!\n    submitted by    /u/Suitable-Pension169  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm getting onboarded to be the senior admin at a small company as the existing admin is set to retire soon. They sell software which basically consists of a desktop app (office workers) and a mobile app (field works) with a back end in SQL.\n Most all our customers are small as well without dedicated IT depts. So if a customer chooses, our company will host their SQL & Web Server in a cloud VM, give it a public IP, and let the mobile app and desktop apps connect there rather than the customer hosting it themselves.\n Last week, I was being shown how we buy and license SQL for a new implementation. The guy showed me we get SQL standard and enough CALs to cover each office user, plus one CAL to cover every mobile user, because the app connects to a web server first, then to the SQL server, so SQL would never know that there's multiple app users.\n Granted MS licensing is convoluted, but this is not how I understand CALs. Every mobile user, even though the app is connecting to a middleware, needs a CAL right? Yet this is how they've sold their software for the past few years.\n Not sure exactly what to do now that I've seen this? Bringing it to the attention of owners potentially puts a target on me as overstepping and being a threat to their business model? I'm not even sure how to bring something like this up. Usually big problems are things that are visible like failed hardware. Owners might say \"It works - I don't see the issue\" and I don't blame them - it's hard to understand.\n Fixing it and just eating the license cost could be difficult given this company's size. Re-quoting customers that have been live for years on our software telling them they're not compliant seems equally impossible. Yet this is my living and I kinda need the company to do well so that I can do well. I feel like I've walked into a time bomb that was impossible to see from the outside.\n    submitted by    /u/yinor62332  \n [link]   [comments]",

CTO is a paranoid fuck and never wanted to give the keys up to any of his systems for us to work with, one of the reasons I was told is because I’m not part of their ethnoreligious group, so I’m considered an “outsider”. Fine, whatever. But everyone else at the client loves me. I get great customer feedback, my metrics are great, and even my supervisors are always singing my praises because of all the on-site techs they’ve sent in the past, I’m the only one who’s stuck around and been consistently good at the job.\n So the contract is up June 30th, and my company informed me that they won’t be keeping me on past that. They’re going to let me go despite a perfect record. I’m assuming it’s because I make $60k a year for what’s basically a glorified help desk, but I digress. \n I don’t know why I’m writing this to be honest, I’m just frustrated as hell.

All the Monterey are not having any issues.\n I can’t find anything on the internet that may help resolve our issue. Hopefully someone here has the golden tip.\n    submitted by    /u/berryvanbree  \n [link]   [comments]",

All servers (App and EHR) are located in our premises in the internal segment, and we publish one port (xmpp) to the internet where the mobile app connects to.\n When doctors are at home, the mobile app gets instant messages only, no voice capabilities are enabled over the internet, as this is a regulatory compliance thing. \n On premise, as standard security practice, all doctors personal mobile devices are in guest WiFi vlan, isolated from the internal resources. There is a requirement to open up the guest Wi-Fi vlan to the mobile app servers in the internal segment to enable voice services. Now I’m totally against this, and the mobile app does support any MAM integrations, but would like to understand how admins deal with and secure access to similar business mobile apps.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/MoeShea  \n [link]   [comments]",

Error Log for MSSQLSERVER said Event ID 18456: Login failed for ‘redacted’. Reason: “The account is currently locked out. The system administrator can unlock it.”\n The SQL Login lockouts stopped happening after I reverted the GPO to a “never” lockout threshold.\n QUESTION: Is it possible that the domain GPO account lockout policy is responsible for locking that SQL login?\n I assumed that the GPO only acted on domain users, but all the evidence suggests that’s either exactly what happened, or that’s one heck of a coincidence.\n Maybe if a policy is applied to Domain Computers, it also applies to the Database Server and therefore to SQL logins? Doesn’t sound right… but I’m at a loss!\n Happy to clarify or add any additional info I might’ve forgotten. \n Any insight would be tremendously appreciated, as my boss insists I understand exactly why this happens, and I desperately want to. thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/deadinthefuture  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got a couple users who demand using a Macbook and therefore have to use Parallels if they want to be able to still access some of the applications used at our business.

We do not own or manage this server. I don't have admin access to the server and the remote company claims that there is no way for the RemoteApp to work on the Mac despite Microsoft having support for RemoteApps with their MacOS Remote Desktop App. In fact, I can even RDP into the server (but our accounts don't have desktop access so they disconnect immediately), and if I setup a remote app with the info I have about their server I can see/list the RemoteApps but when I attempt to launch them I get Error code 0x104 (Unable to connect).\n ​\n I actually still have full access to an older server that we used to use RemoteApp with, so I might be able to learn something by looking at it.\n ​\n TLDR: Company claims their 'custom' RemoteApp won't work on the Mac even though it's a glorified RDP connection.

Adobe Acrobat Pro has improved significantly over the last few years with the addition of many new features, including:\n Liquid mode, which automatically reformats text, images, and tables for quick navigation and consumption on small screens.\n Integrations with Google Suite, Box, and Microsoft that enable customers to collaborate and make changes to PDFs directly from Microsoft Teams.\n Expansion to new surfaces that allow customers to access our PDF tools on the web and mobile.\n New e-signature features that streamline workflows and eliminate the need for in-person and “wet” signatures that can slow business down.*\n Reason 1 and 3 should not have been used as a reason. That is like saying, we changed the template on our website to HTML5 and it should look okay now on your phone.\n So at what point does the price gouging stop? It seems like were being charged for common updates.\n The e-signatures, I can understand. Fighting DocuSign. DocuSign can lick my butt. But something tells me this will be removed in the future from the Pro license and used as an add-on service. Like the way Microsoft tells you, any person can call in to your Teams meeting. But you need a conference bridge, and only after you pay for the conference license of $2.50 per user. That pools your minutes together. Which can be chewed up by just a single user who mistakenly uses the call me at this number feature.\n    submitted by    /u/AdderallBuyersClub  \n [link]   [comments]",

Their environment has no structure that I can see, or at least it's very limited (a few VLANS and a domain). I'm new to running the show, and I would greatly appreciate any advice on where to begin to try to get this place in order.\n Most of the machines are on Windows 11 right now, with some of the servers on 2012 and some I'm not even sure of. We have a handful of legacy applications which require some *really* old software to run, and I'm hoping to sandbox all of that in a VM eventually.\n We have multiple different backup solutions, some of them local and some of them are cloud-based. All of that is automated already.\n I'm working on a hardware inventory, as what we had was woefully inadequate and so I'm not actually 100% certain of what's present beyond what I can walk around and see.\n Our server room is unsecured; Anyone can just walk right in with no fob and no swipe.\n We do have a corporate help desk from the company that purchased this location, but they primarily just manage purchasing decisions and provisioning.\n So, again, in terms of where to begin, right now I have my eyes firmly on the security of our server room and the hardware inventory, followed by getting hosts on some kind of naming convention and then the same for users... I'm sure there are a hundred more important things I could and should be thinking about, so please do feel free to shout at me what you think those are.\n ​\n Thank you!\n (For those of you who are rolling your eyes, please know that I already searched the sub for similar posts and have read through quite a few of them)\n    submitted by    /u/_Tock_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sometimes it will return to function within seconds, but it generally needs to be closed via task manager. \n It is replicable on multiple computers, so I do not think it is a local issue, and occurs both offsite on home internet, on onsite on our guaranteed 1000/1000 link, I had begun to think it was an IOPS issue but I can't find any reports on throttling in the azure monitoring.\n I am at a bit of a loss of where to go to from here, view the process and what it is waiting on in task manager when it is hanging gives me \"one or more thread of explorer.exe are waiting to finish network I/O\" as if explorer.exe has stopped communicating to the internet, but the file will finish downloading and launch. still.\n I am just absolutely confounded. If anyone has any ideas or could point in the right direction of some information to check out, I would be eternally grateful.\n    submitted by    /u/Trickshot1322  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're about 3 months into the new company, and we still don't have a defined on-call policy. My management has been making up rules on the fly as we go, and it's really starting to get to us. We went from being restricted, to no restrictions and a loose \"1-2 hour response time\". Instead of standby, they were doing block hours, where ticket = 2 hour pay, but as of today they've taken that away. We've been told that our overtime for on-call is basically just \"whatever we worked\". Except, we've been told that we still need to look at tickets (we get texts for urgent tickets), but we need to decide if we'll respond or not. If…",

Since he was leaving, though, as well as the IT Director, I feared they would put me in charge of all of IT if I accepted, so I suggested a peer structure for the tech leads, which is what we went with.\n Fast forward a year and the interim IT Director leaves and they don’t replace him. Fast forward another year and they ask me to be the Director of IT as discussed in that previous post. I assessed what was needed, recommended they hire a director of IT with experience in IT management and tried to move on.\n A couple of months later they asked me to take over some temporary IT responsibilities while the main IT person was on vacation. A few months later they ask me to manage him. 🤦‍♂️ I again reiterated that they should hire an IT Director and that I would prefer to stay in software development, managing engineers.\n A couple of months later they laid me off as some in the previous thread predicted.\n I suppose the lesson in there could be to just do whatever job they ask you to do and suck it up, but the lesson to me is that I had it sniffed out for 3 years earlier where this was all headed. They wanted a Director of IT on the cheap and without listening to the recommendations of their own staff.\n It's still burning me up when I think about it.

I have made a template for Windows Server 2022 Datacenter and had questions regarding the WS licenses we received. The licenses are \"Windows Server 2022 Datacenter (16 CORE)\" and we received two product keys per each of the servers. Is there anything I should know if I were to assign these product keys to VMs? I read that the WS22 DC licenses are unlimited use per host compared to the Standard edition. If they are unlimited use, can I use the same product key on each of the servers running VMs? We are attempting to do failover on the servers as well, which is currently set up; we just need VMs now. Also, am I able to add the product key to the template I made and every future VM from that template will be licensed as well?\n ​\n Any insight is appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/SaltySarcasm7  \n [link]   [comments]",

Redundancy and all that. \n Our existing domain controllers have 4 time servers already, but they're all in the east. So I hop into a Powershell session on the new DC and hammer out the following:\n w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:\"server1.domain.com,0x8 server2.domain.com,0x8 server3.domain.com,0x8 server4.domain.com,0x8 server5.domain.com,0x8\" /syncfromflags:manual /update \n I get the message that the command ran successfully. All good right? I go to verify with:\n w32tm /query /peers \n Bad news. Nothing has changed. It's still the same four time servers that were originally there. \n I've spent the better part of a week researching and attempting all permutations of the command I can think of to induce literally any change to the list and nothing.

The success of this project is crucial as any inaccuracies could jeopardize my job. I aim to automate the process, but due to the diverse range of X-ray machine brands in our environment, finding a universal solution is challenging. The operating systems of the devices lack consistency and sufficient detail for a simple network scan. Additionally, not all models provide this information in the registry. The best approach I can think of is to rely on human input, albeit with the potential for human error. I plan to email each clinic manager, requesting the model and serial number of the X-ray machine, or even a picture of it, to ensure comprehensive accuracy.\n    submitted by    /u/Spezisaweakmale  \n [link]   [comments]",

My plan was to get the az-104 cert, both as extra evidence I know what I'm doing and so I can fill in knowledge gaps, plus it gave some justification for the sabbatical in interviews.\n Unfortunately I need a new job sooner than expected. I've been studying, but after taking a practice exam... It isn't looking great. Based on my last job I'm confident in my abilities in practice, but the practice exam seemed very based on memorising minutiae instead. While the exam wasn't great, tons of grammar and spelling errors making it hard to parse, I do believe the types of questions are representative.\n I can continue to study but I'll end up going over budget, or I can pause this, start interviewing now without the cert, and hope for the best.\n Do you think there will be a significant difference between my offers with 3 years azure etc experience + 6 months break vs the same but with az-104 picked up in that time? Would mentioning my cert goal and studying help? I have very little interview experience :(\n Tldr: difference in ability to land a good job with or without az-104 after 3 years cloud sysadmin exp, and a break?\n    submitted by    /u/Metazoick  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are a fully SaaS Company and in general I manage all SaaS tools (Google Workspace, Slack, WorkspaceONE and couple more tools we dont have an Provider like OneLogin but at the end I try to Automate everything to make it a bit easier for me) for our Hardware we are currently 50/50 one half is managed by us the other is managed by our Hardware provider but ofc. I also manage them. Little sub note: all devices that comes from our Hardware Provider are MDM managed all others are getting added by myself step by step you know its pain sometimes to get first all the Users Device Informations (Have to ask them). Since couple months it can get really busy almost max. of my cap thats why I wrote some more policies and telling the users to always using the IT Helpdesk if they have any Questions. Now I had a meeting were they ask me to write down my tasks I did last week and asked my about IT Outsourcing to Support me e.g as Backup when being Sick or on Vacation. I told them yes we can check out but I am not sure if this would be the solution In my opinion we should get another sysadmin there) I 'am also a bit scared about if maybe I get replaced after they Implement the IT Outsourcing since I worked a lot in the company and did a lot changes I would be really sad If something like that would happens.\n ​\n Somehow I feel since the Meeting not quite well, I always think about it. Do you have any tips? atm. I'am on vacation for 4 Days without any Backup.\n ​\n Best regards,\n kpwde\n    submitted by    /u/kpwde  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not a big deal at the moment but in our reports we're having like 100 Pro Versions now where there should be a solid 6k Enterprise.

I write this in the hopes that someone can point me in a direction where I might be able to find out more about the issue.\n System is running Windows 10 22H2 build 19045.2965, browser is Firefox v113.\n To the issue itself:\n When I try and reach https://www.\\[domainname\\].com it gives me an error and says \"Access Denied\" \"You don't have permission to access \"http://www.\\[domainname\\].com/\" on this server.\"\n Which I find highly suspicious because being redirected to an http site might pose an security risk, which is why I believe the client/DNS cache and thus the system itself might be compromised... It's only this one specific site that yields the issue.\n Have any of you encountered something like this? I've disabled all the browser's addons, but to no avail. Just ran in-depth malware check on the system, but it yielded no detection at all...\n Any ideas what to do next/what to look for?\n    submitted by    /u/7buergen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I am facing a (hopefully solvable) problem, as I cannot directly influence some things. The following situation:\n Domain A is managed by DFN. The web server for domain A was provided by my employer. Due to lack of staff, web server provisioning has been discontinued. We received a backup before the shutdown. The administration of domain A should remain with DFN.\n We then purchased Domain B from STRATO, including the web server. There we imported the backup and made the site available again.\n Domain A is well known by everyone and appears high up in Google. Therefore domain A should be redirected to domain B without an underlying web server. The support at DFN has entered the IP address of the web server of STRATO for domain A, which appears by a ping. However, STRATO can apparently not process this request, so that when the IP is called, simply a \"Not found\" appears.\n The support at DFN has no idea, and I do not know enough about the subject. He said that this is due to the configuration of the web server at STRATO.\n How do I get the problem solved?\n Thanks :)\n    submitted by    /u/diggerydigsby  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, users are reporting that since this month's update they have trouble logging in when the screen locks. IT discovered the reason is when the screen locks, the keyboard layout doesn't default back to English like it normally did but stays at the current language being used. Users' passwords are always \"English\" since that's what the keybord layout normally defaults on the lock screen. So they keep getting wrong password, until they mouse over to change the layout.\n I tested and it seems to be affecting Windows 10 (22H2) only. Windows 11 works as expected. Anyone else seeing this?

Since I joined, my colleagues never liked me (they have been there for 15+ years and expected me to do what they tell me to do rather than working as a team). However, my manager have always been supportive of me and understood the dynamics of how my colleagues would underpin me being the new guy. Now my position became a full time but i have to reapply like all other applicants. Recently my manager hinted that someone else applied internally and he seems to be a good fit as he got along well with my current team and that guy has been referred from top management. And he suggested if I would be okay to continue working for another 1 year contract. I felt bad and hurt as I invested in couple of certs in this job hoping my hard work and my certs would make me a good candidate once the position becomes full time. My manager told me he likes how I am always calm and thoughtful and he told me to think about his plan. I didn’t express my emotions or said anything when he told me this news. Now should I tell him I was hoping to get this full time and hoping to be part of this company growing up the ladder.

It became a bigger problem and took down our CRM, SAP and SharePoint for 2 - 3 hours which resulted in slow and terrible analysis roughly 6 weeks ago. Decisions were made, thrown away and then decided again.\n During this time the team I am part of had the main issues because automations took ages / timed out since the FS wasn't always available or slow. \n Guess what we learned on Friday? We didn't create backups for the main share since end of April! Called in a contractor to go over everything and noticed bad sectors / partition starts corrupting. So tonight was supposed to be a full backup because we cannot risk anything, right???\n Well I told my team lead, who graciously got assigned on-call, that he should be prepared for dead scheduled tasks tomorrow morning or worse. He just send me a message \"10 people in a meeting - incl. head of infrastructure. Seemingly the partition died\"\n Well why have a call about a dead drive surely we deployed RAID XYZ? About that...

Friends, Family, Clients, really just anyone that knows that I \"do computers\" has come to me for help. It was exhausting and incredibly stressful. So I set up boundaries, over the years the friends/family policy turned into \"Do not ask me for any IT help what so ever. I will not help you. There is no amount of money that will make me help you. I do not want to fix your computer, I am not going to fix your computer. I do not care what the issue is, find someone else\"\n Clients were a bit different as they are paying me to do IT work. But after so so SO many \"Help! When I log in, the printer shows up 10mins late\" and \"Emergency! The printer is printing in dark grey instead of black ink!!\" and general \"USB slow, please help, need antivirus\" I just honestly don't care either. \n Honestly, I've noticed I barely use a computer or tech in my free time, because I just don't want to deal with it. \n Has this happened to anyone else?

          "description": "Hi Guys, \n I am trying to map external mapped drives (shares from a different domain server) through group policy. \n Since Microsoft no longer offer the ability to specify login details I can't connect to drives using the different domain. \n The users/servers are joined via site to site vpn so can access the servers, I'm just trying to automate the process so we don't have to manually map these every so often. \n Is the only way to do this via a script? I have tried using a script via group policy but they don't seem to run correctly or end up failing for no real reason. (But work when ran locally) \n Another thing to mention is there's 2 security groups that need access to these, which have different permissions/access for files so will need 2 separate setups for each group. (Group is held on the external server)\n I understand the best method for this would be to have connected the DCs but the client was only willing to pay for essentials and the 2nd/external server came along later. \n Any suggestions are appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/cryptex___  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I'm trying to do is write out some SNMP monitoring rules for a Bosch IP camera, but I don't have access to the device yet in order to figure out what to monitor.\n We're using a really rudimentary SNMP monitoring system where you give it the OID and it monitors it for a response within the guidelines you give it. I wish we'd migrate to something more intelligent but you play the hand you're dealt.\n What I'd normally do is:\n  \nRun an SNMP walk on the device using its MIB (which I have)\n Confirm the MIB against the walk to make sure the numbers line up\n Strip out the stuff I can't monitor against/don't care about\n Make the monitor using the OIDs that remain\n  \nHere I don't have the device, all I have is the MIB. Looking at it, I can see that – for example – \"temp-sens\" is \"1.3.6.1.4.1.3967.1.1.7.1.1 \" , but that's only so useful to me because I can't tell from the MIB whether I should be expecting anything after this to denote the individual sensor (\".1.1\", for example).\n Loading the MIB into various freeware programs does not make this immediately apparently either.\n Is there any technowizardry I can do ahead of time to denote the various sensors on the device (or at least tell if the MIB expects them) or is the only true indication of a device's SNMP capabilities taken from inspecting the device itself?\n    submitted by    /u/ghoststart  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've reached out to the software company who are also based in the UK to request for administrative access to the system but they've refused unless we undergo a £400 3hr training course (and pass it based on their 'feeling'). The system isn't anything complicated, and our account manager is somewhat of a dinosaur and doesn't understand the basics of the day to day regulatory requirements of running an IT service it just seems to be a bit of a 'being difficult' situation. Does anyone know if there's anything that goes against some form of legality etc if a software company that sells software to withold administrative access to the customer so they can generate more business in doing so? (ontop of a very hefty annual bill they are charging per new task).\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Ship8229  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm not sure how odd this will sound, but I'd like to reach out and gauge how much dev work some of you do. There is a bit of a fuzzy line with devops nowadays, as well as X as code, plus scripting is a way of writing code as well.\n So where does sysadmin end, then? I often find myself adjusting or extending the source code of FOSS Software we use as well, is this still part of a sysadmin job or have I veered over into dev territory?\n We're a small team and there's not a whole lot in terms of automation. And obviously no devops since we don't have any devs. This, in combination with me being a junior/early in my career and also having had an interest in programming as a hobby has led to me feeling like I lack a proper frame of reference on what is normal for a modern sysadmin. It has also led to a severe case of double imposter syndrome as I feel like I am faking being a dev AND an admin while doing neither of the two properly.\n Are any of you in a similar position or want to share your thoughts? Should I specialise more or stick with my somewhat special \"stuck between worlds\" approach? I really love the way it makes me fit into my current team as it makes me feel like really having an impact by pushing us forward by automating and streamlining workflows. But at the same time I worry that it'll make it extremely hard to find a new job if I have to as other employers will likely look for some kind of specialist whereas I've cranked the generalist knob way past 11.\n Small disclaimer: I know that usually there's teams for different parts of sysadmin (networking, security, systems, etc) but as stated, we're small and just a handful of people so we have to wear several hats anyway.\n    submitted by    /u/AiPapi22  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey folks, We’re doing some tests with OCFS2 for creating an active passive setup across two regions.\n In the current setup, we have two DCs, dc01 and dc02. VMs vm01 and vm02 share an ocfs2 fs. The shared virtual disk resides on a dedicated lun that is replicated to the remote site. vm03 and vm04 are in dc02 with ocfs2 setup with the same cluster name. For failover the vms in dc01 are shutdown, the lun is switched to rw mode in dc02, virtual disks are mounted in vm03/04 and then ocfs2 is mounted. This is working as expected but involves tasks at the san level.\n I was reading about drdb and was wondering if we can use it to replicate the ocfs2 in dc01 over wan to dc02. In this approach we’ll just use independent virtual disks and not use the san based replication.\n But is this even possible? Should we setup drdb between vm01 and vm03 or is my understanding not correct?\n    submitted by    /u/kottapar  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n My organization is looking for a cost-effective MDM solution that is suitable for our environment and our requirements. The primary objectives are to manage BYOD (mainly mobile devices with Andoird, iOS operating systems) and a few corporate mobile devices if applicable, such as controlling the number of mobile devices per user, secure access (requiring devices to be password-protected, data to be wiped in case of theft or compromise). \n Currently, we do not use Microsoft Office but Google Workspace (G-Suite) with Enterprise Starter license. As with this license, we can enable basic features of mobile device management, like enabling passcode, wiping data. On the other hand, we wish to limit the number of authorized/registered mobile devices (BYOD), and also want to improve some optional features, such as blocking insecure devices (jailbreak or rooted devices, unsupported/legacy devices), requiring anti-malware protection, requiring device encryption, automatically removing devices that haven't check in for 30 days.\n We have narrowed down the list of vendors to Google Workspace (Advanced Device Management), ScaleFusion, Miradore. Some of the solution providers that are ruled out include Microsoft Intune (I love it but we are using Google Workspace), JumpCloud (Anroid devices not supported), SimpleMDM & Mosyle (only iOS devices supported). I personally prefer Google Workspace (Advanced Device Management) given the fact that our ecosystem is based on it (we will not have to invest more time or resources to another solution) and our security requirements are just fundamental.\n Given that, can you share your feedback or experience in this matter? Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/sanba06c  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know other people that use RDP for the reason I want to use it for too, so thats why Im deciding to use it, however none of them ran into the problem im having.\n Ive created 2 seperate Admin accounts on my PC, one with just a Name / pw, and the other with my microsoft email.\n I am using \"127.0.0.2\" to try and log into the either of the second users, and using the microsoft account one does not work for some reason, it says credentials are wrong. However I can use the other user that i named \"Test\" with a password i set.\n However upon loggin into that account, I am greeted by the error stated in the title. I have googled the issue and there are a ton of people also having similar problem, will some suggestions saying to add registry keys, or change some setttings in windows to change the limit of connections.

This TVs have Android and Chromecast built-in and will be connected over Wifi. I have already set up an hidden SSID with a separate VLAN with only guest access (they can't reach any service or server aside from the ones I decide to). I have also set up a Windows 10 VM to try casting via Google Chrome and it works fine. The issue is that this setup takes a lot of resources from the VM and sometimes the image on the TVs gets \"blurry\" when it's still for a few mins. The question is: is there a better way to do what I'm doing? I can't find any viable desktop software that lets me cast to multiple devices. \n Unfortunately, we can't use any additional wiring because the distances will be too high. The only thing we could improve would be to connect the TVs via Ethernet. \n Thanks in advance for any tips/suggestions!\n    submitted by    /u/Koobetto  \n [link]   [comments]",

In our non-production systems, the best timing I could get for the activity was about 15 hours. Then 2 hours for checkout. So I have been advertising a 18 hour outage to give me some slush time. Coming in a couple hours early would make everyone happy, and running over would be painful, so having a little extra fluff was great (AKA The Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott Engineering Rule).\n Cut to today. Had everything in place, management was frothing to get this going. They were all on the phone call for the official 'Go' decision. Then the inexplicable happens. Total time needed to complete: 7 hours, including checkout. WTF? Am I happy the upgrade went smooth and finished with zero issues, yes? But, WTF?\n 15 minutes after the note to the users that the system was ready, I got my first email from management wanting to know who was responsible for missing the target by 10 hours. Some of the overseas sites are upset because they rescheduled manufacturing and warehousing schedules based on my estimate. Now I have to spend the next week explaining why my vendors seemed to be 'sandbagging' the non-prod systems and padding their numbers. Plus my credibility next time I go to ask for a production window is shot now.\n    submitted by    /u/digitalamish  \n [link]   [comments]",

The IT manager has experience with managed service providers and is skilled in project management, with previous knowledge of IT infrastructure. Therefore, the department is being managed by someone who is proficient in growing and documenting processes, as the company has a lack of documentation in general.\n My goal is to better manage the IT department and help it grow. I am interested in knowing the difference between an IT support specialist and a systems administrator and how I can develop my skills to become a future systems administrator for the company. I am eager to learn more about network administration, server management, and security management and pursue relevant certifications, such as Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA), or CompTIA Security+.

It's possible to create VM on packet tracer, or the 'graphical' interface on the computers is enough ?\n 2) Ok for local connection, what about VPN ? It's something I'm learning on my own but never install/configure one from now, is it difficult to link with RADIUS ?\n 3) For now I want to build my own classic RADIUS lab but I think I'm screwed to do it in entreprise...

          "description": "Note: the system this post refers to is on premise.\n I'm not a sysadmin, so I could be wrong about this, but it seems wrong to me that to RDP into the computers in the DMZ, I need to remember/maintain a local windows account for each computer in the DMZ (we have several dozen). These accounts' passwords also expire after a month, which makes managing the accounts even more difficult. I have searched the web for what is considered best practice, and I haven't been able to find anything I can understand. I've seen a few posts about Read Only Domain Controllers and Jump Servers, but as a non sysadmin, I'm having a hard time understanding these.\n Now that you understand my question, let me give you a brief explanation of our system.\n The system is entirely on prem. At the front, we have a load balancer with a public IP. This is what our customers connect to. Behind the load balancer, we have the DMZ. The DMZ contains a number of windows server VMs running IIS. Behind the DMZ, we have our AD network. This is where our application and database server are. It's also where the computers used by our staff are.\n As a user of the system, my computer is in the AD network. As I mentioned earlier, I sometimes need to RDP into a server in the DMZ. Ideally, I would just use my AD credentials to authenticate, but that doesn't work because the DMZ is not part of the AD network.\n So, could you please tell me if the best way to connect to the servers in the DMZ is via local windows accounts? Another thing I'd like to know is, is a DMZ even necessary? Why can't the load balancer just route to the appropriate computer in the AD network?\n    submitted by    /u/Personal-Drama-8446  \n [link]   [comments]",

As some mentioned, I tried to re-pitch my ideas using more business terms and to try to frame the proposal as more of a risk management type of thing. The CTO's response to that was that it's too high-level and she wants more details.\n So I tried again (for the 4th time) with the following 2 items :\n - buying an EDR solution and installing it on every endpoint to protect from ransomware and other viruses\n - buying Windows Pro for the laptops and Azure AD P1\n Both of these suggestions were again rejected because:\n a) they were not detailed enough and didn't show how the cost of the licenses would bring value to the company\n b) she claimed that we already have Azure AD. I had previously showed her that we have Azure AD Free which includes very few features and is certainly not enough to get where we want to go. Is she intentionally lying because she doesn't want to spend on a P1 license? did she not check the console to confirm what she said? It's not like this is a matter of opinion, she's just refusing to see what's there.\n So yeah, I tried again before giving up but at this point I just don't see why I would spend more time fighting with this person who clearly has no intention of helping me in my duties.\n Also note: I confirmed they're aiming for ISO 27001 certification - she said they previously had it in 2019 but it expired. Not sure how that's possible but I saw the certificate myself so it's true.\n EDIT: Just to clarify, the ISO certification is from 2018 and applies to software development and software products and services only. There was no surveillance audit done after the certification and it was not renewed.

Helpdesk plus, because they wanted me but my skillset was above helpdesk so they paid me a bit more and gave me more to do. 3 people, 100 employees, 200+ students.\n 2 years later the boss leaves for another state. Family reasons. my coworker and I absorb his job, he gets the hot seat and I take on the Sys admin roles and most user facing duties. We work more like a team then a boss/subordinate pairing and life is good, though a bit overworked. We're not just coworkers, were friends, and this makes life immensely more bearable.\n 3 years later I find myself locking his accounts and shutting down his keycards. Didn't have a great year and a lot of personal issue's. He left amicably, and there's no bitterness about it. it may be best for him to get a fresh start. A least thats what we decided the takeaway should be.\n But that leaves me, a one man shop. I know enough to keep the school running, but I dont even know who I answer to officially. They told me that I'll learn how to do the budget stuff for the department Monday, but they literally just had my \"Letter of Agreement\" renewal 20 minutes before they told my boss he was leaving and there was no discussion of a title change or a raise. Apparently, they've been talking to an MSP and some restructuring, but I've been told my job is secure.\n I'm still a bit numb and trying to process it all. I don't want to leave my job, I absolutely love where I am and what I do. but since everyone else rants on this sub about their job I figured I would pour some stress into the webs as well...

I'm unsure if I should take it directly to HR or just let management take it from here. The last time, nothing came of it and it never went beyond the team's manager.\n  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I had a user yesterday receive a phishing email with a link to 'keep his password'. This email made it through our email filtering. It was sent by a legitimate business whose email address had been compromised. Our associate clicked this link which took them to a website mimicking a Microsoft login page. He typed his credentials in. At this point the malicious party had his credentials and attempted to sign into his account. The associate received the Microsoft Authenticator push notification. The push notification presented numbers that the party attempting to login would need to enter in order to gain access. This was new to the associate. He was used to the simple 'approve' or 'deny' buttons on the push notification. He admitted that they would have hit the 'approve' button if it would have been presented.\n In last month's meeting with executive management I explained the the CA policies we have in place for our 365 logins. Only 25% of our 365 accounts need to be able to connect from outside our facility (manufacturing), so we have a CA policy that prevents 75% of our accounts from connecting outside the facility. We also have a CA policy blocking connections from all countries other than USA, with an exception group we can temporarily add an associate's account to for international travel. We have a CA policy enforcing MFA for all logins and a CA policy that requires modern auth clients to use approved client apps and protection policies.\n During this meeting I explained that we would be rolling out Number Matching for our push notifications. I explained that the flaw in the push notification is that associates are so used to approval prompts on their cellphones, that the chances of them approving an illegitimate login is quite likely.\n It feels good to have that validation that you're not just talking crazy and that the scenarios you lay out actually can and will happen.\n    submitted by    /u/DoYouHaveASecond  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I understand, LAPS requires Group Policy refreshes and such to check-in or sync from time to time. Since we don't have VPN for end users to touch the DC's while offsite, I'm guessing that's part of the issue with the passwords not working.\n Am wondering if anyone has an alternative? Just need to run a CMD prompt as Admin on remote users laptops for installs, open Device Manager as Admin etc, nothing fancy.\n One thought is to write a system level service that's deployed on all laptops. The service can be invoked under the user context and get permission to run Admin level commands from some from of Azure authentication that doesn't require VPN or on-prem DC's. \n I'm willing to research and develop this, however just want to know if some existing solution is already out there. Not interested in packaging apps with Intune. Trying to make this simpler and 'just work'.\n What are your thoughts?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BlueInTune  \n [link]   [comments]",

These machines are installed all over the world, and they all have a Windows PC on board, so Teamviewer was an easy way for remote access/support.\n However we want to move away from Teamviewer for 2 reasons:\n - security : we don't want to use Teamviewer anymore, as it introduces a security risk in the customers network.\n - user friendliness: Teamviewer recently had a complete overhaul of it's UI. Nobody likes it anymore.\n So as a solution, we want to equip all our machines with a VPN gateway device (eg Ewon or IXON). That way, we can connect via VPN to our machine local network (much safer). Once that we are connected via VPN, we can use VNC to remotely control the machine PC.\n I just started evaluating the different VNC implementations (TightVNC, ultraVNC,...). However they have not changed since I've used them about twenty years ago.\n I am missing drag and drop support for file transfer and performance (fluent updates) is way worse than Teamviewer. I also checked out Windows Quick Assist, but this requires manual starting the connection at the customer side. We need an 'always on' server service so we can connect to the machine anytime.\n Does anybody has some suggestions for remote access that works (like VNC) only in a LAN (so no Teamviewer, Anydesk, Splashtop,...)\n Thx,\n Thomas.\n    submitted by    /u/Thomas_VDB  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello ! I'm doing a lot of learning in my own labs recently and I noticed something a bit odd.\n I set up banned word list on Azure AD. It includes, for example, all fruits and animals. I understand how the password strength is calculated behind the scenes so even with my word list, the following password is accepted on AAD: Hippopotamus!Raspberry!Chimpanzee!\n ​\n I installed the agent and proxy right on the DC of my VM lab. I check the Event Viewer logs to track what happens. \n However, this password above is not accepted. I guess it's because it has the banned words? \n So it gives me the impression that the Azure Password Protection agent does an exact match to the word list. If the password contains any of the banned words, then It's rejected. However, on AAD, I can change the password to Hippopotamus!Raspberry!Chimpanzee! and Writeback seems to set it on premises as well.\n I feel like I am not understanding something ... Is this the expected behaviour? Or perhaps the configuration is missing something? Is it failing because the default password policy on a fresh Server 2019 DC requires numbers as well?

I've started with the windows server proxies, as they have less components and I expected to be more easy.\n But, this is where things are getting crazy. When I remove any Windows server from the domain, when it reboots, it gets stuck with the previous user that logged on. If I'm smart enough to have logged on with the local administrator when removing the machine from the domain, at least I can log in. But if I forget that and use my domain account it get stuck after reboot. There is no option to switch to another user. Even if I log in with the administrator account and try to lock, sign out, switch account, any of that, it just doesn't work.\n What am I missing here? Is this the effect of the remains of some GPO of the domain?\n While researching I've come across two policies that could be affecting in that way, but it seems that they're not being applied, since the machine is not in the domain anymore.\n Interactive logon: Don't display last signed-in > Disabled\n Enumerate local users on domain-joined computers > Not Configured\n I've also tried cleaning the GPOS after leaving the domain, by running: RD /S /Q \"%WinDir%\\System32\\GroupPolicyUsers\" && RD /S /Q \"%WinDir%\\System32\\GroupPolicy\"\n By creating a new Windows Server VM, I can confirm that the normal, non-domain server have the switch user and also lists the local users, if it happens to have more than one.\n I don't know what else to check.\n I'm including screenshots from two servers, one that have leaved the domain, and one fresh install, non-domain. https://imgur.com/a/sS5R6XG\n    submitted by    /u/paganois  \n [link]   [comments]",

When people come to me with an error during a UAT demo and I fix it there and then, the recognition from that goes a lot further than me staring at a broken function or a outdated depending for the better part of an hour. \n I have experience with networking and basic data transfer protocols, but thats as far as it goes.

Might not all be implemented in Windows 11 but it's their goal.\n A few key things mentioned;\n  \nEnforcing code signing for apps in Windows by default, with opt-out options. \n \nBy default, completely blocking script files (PS1, BAT etc) that were downloaded from the internet and other permission limitations. \n \nApp control designed to avoid 'dialogue fatigue' like what you see with UAC/MacOS. OS will look at what apps the user installs/uses and enable based on that (ie, someone who downloads VS Code, Aida32, Hex Editors etc won't have this enabled but someone who just uses Chrome, VPN and other basic things will). Can still be manually enabled.\n \nElaborates on the 'Microsoft Pluton' project - something that MS will update themselves - implementing this due to how terrible OEM's handle TPM standards themselves.\n \nWorking with major 3rd parties to reduce permission requirements (so that admin isn't required to use). MS starting to move towards a memory safe language in the kernel with RUST.\n \nScrapping the idea of building security technologies around the kernel based on users having admin rights, and making users non-admin by default - discusses the challenges involved with this and how they need to migrate many of the win32 tools/settings away from requiring admin rights first before implementing this. Toolkit will be on Github to preview.\n \nExplains how they're planning to containerise win32 apps (explains MSIX setup files too).

We're currently sitting at almost 50% of them (that we know of) having daily blue screens, all from the same issue: bad RAM. From my testing, it seems that these laptops are killing the RAM sticks. I ran memtest86 in one of them and it showed a ton of errors.

The previous server was on Server 2016. \n When I install WDS on the new Server (in Standalone mode, same mode WDS was using under previous set up) I can't approve any pending devices and get an \"Element not found\" error message. \n WDS settings used: \n PXE Response: Respond to all client computers (known and unknown) - Require admin approval for unknown computers is ticked. Boot: Known/unknow clients: Continue the PXE boot unless the user presses the ESC key DHCP: Do not listen on DHCP ports - unchecked, Configure DHCP options to indicate that this is also a PXE server - unchecked TFTP: Maximum Block Size: 0, Enable Variable Window Extension - unchecked Rest are as defaults \n I've found that if I untick 'Require admin approval for unknown computers' the devices skip the pending stage and will image fine but I need to be able to retain control of which devices can receive an image through PXE. \n I also have found that I can click the Approve and Name option, give the client I am trying to image a name and run through a wizard without filling in any of the other options and it then works. I found the flat file that contains the approved clients on the old server and every device has a name like 'Domain Admin1' 'Domain Admin2' and so on. It's not the end of the world to have to do it this way but I'm still hopeful there is a way to get it to work like I had on the older server where I could simply right click the client and hit approve.\n The new server is domain joined member server only with just the WDS role installed. DHCP remains on a different server. I'm logged into the new server with admin rights. \n Just can't see what is causing this, any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/insoul8  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR - Has anyone else run into employees using low-cost VPN providers and how have you dealt with it?\n We recently implemented a robust security platform and have since discovered that about 10 of our work-from-home users are using low-cost VPN providers to connect to our corporate resources ( We do not have or require a corporate VPN in place for access as all of the resources are publicly web-based). We found that a few of them are choosing to have endpoints in South America and Europe. Despite the increased latency from the VPN and the subsequent latency from the endpoint location they are picking (we are US based), 9 out of 10 of these people aren't technical and have no idea why they are using a VPN apart from it making them \"safer\". \n Much like other employers, we now state that employees must have their own reliable internet connection at home, but that's where it stops. Keep in mind that these low-cost VPN providers are not being installed on any corporate-owned devices and are either being installed on their personal PC that they are then accessing things like OWA or other web-based resources, or a few that have installed and setup the VPN inside their home firewall and is funneling all traffic from their internal network through the VPN. Please refrain from suggesting to just shut their access off. I am looking for how others have handled this situation and not suggestions on how to screw the users over.\n The real-world impact of the users using these VPN providers is that it affects their performance, sometimes creating \"impossible travel\" alerts when they switch endpoints, and possible blindspots to security threats (as explained in the next sentence). I am hesitant to create policy exceptions in the security platform as the threat hunters indicated that a lot of real-world bad actors use these VPN providers to help add an extra layer of obfuscation when attacking a target.\n    submitted by    /u/excitedsolutions  \n [link]   [comments]",

Essentially I have SMB connections dropping at random. Could be a mapped drive or an open file in excel. \n Typically to recreate the issue I have a drive mapped to our file share and I work with files on the shares. When the connection drops my mapped drive shows connected but shows no used space indicator. Try opening the drive and it askes for authentication; however, any authentication is met with access denied. If I unmap the drive or in some cases the drive won't be mapped but I have notepad++ open with a file from the share it will recover.\n ​\n I've tried all the typical troubleshooting with SMB. Wireshark shows the access being denied, almost looks as if the client thinks it already is auth'd but the server sees it as anonymous. Wiresharked both client and server and confirmed they are communicating. Procmon shows nothing useful. SMBClient, server and connectivity logs show absolutely nothing about my user ID even authenticating or anything related to my connection.\n ​\n I've tried using the DFS share, regular UNC path with hostname and IP and still get access denied. It's not tied to one specific client, server or user.\n ​\n Really stuck on this one if anyone has an idea.\n ​\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/doublez3r0  \n [link]   [comments]",

Model M340C to be specific. We plan to use them as emergency backup devices, y'know? Worst case and that, in case everything goes wrong, you have some old devices in a box that you can pull out and use with a temporary license. \n However, the devices seems to be still configured with the data from the former owner. Not that there is much to harvest, it's set to load a website that's not existing anymore and that's all. As far as I can tell at least. However I can't get into the admin settings to delete the certificate or other settings as it's password locked.\n Igel Clients can't be reset to factory settings (as far as I know) without involving the Igel support (think of it like the 48 character code for bitlocker locked devices) and that might require some informations of the previous owner, that we don't have. I'm confident that they still may help us however, that would be a bit time consuming to prepare that codes for all the devices and the discussion with them. \n So I hoped that someone might know a different workaround, if I can access the device on a different way and get rid of the certificate that prevents me from adding it to the managment suite and so on. \n Also I hope that since the devices are not reset, that the former owner also didn't removed the licenses.

So I know my strengths and weaknesses, and well aware I have a long stretch ahead of me, and I'm not looking forward to it. And it's not really about the work, but it also kind of is, in what I'll be expected to do if I remain in my current role. I've always gone above and beyond learning about the business around me, and I want to follow my interests. In my situation pay would not be an issue, and hiring managers are positive about me in the role, however I'm just not sure I have all the required knowledge when it comes to things like R and statistics. A lot of us here have some interesting career paths, this can't be that unique and frankly I think it's a huge asset to have sysadmin knowledge in a data analyst role.

They used to outsource their IT to MSP but since hiring me, we are doing away with that. We have some locations that have Sophos firewalls and some that have no firewalls. I want to standardize everything but don't particularly want to invest in more Sophos. I don't love their product, but don't hate it either, just kind of in the middle - unimpressed but it works ok. By the way, I have a good grasp on networking as I've been in the industry 15 years, but I'm really a jack of all trades and a master of none meaning I'm not a network engineer so I want something easy to manage. We are lucky to have no on prem servers or anything special, so have a very easy/uncomplicated network topology. Everything is cloud based, SaaS, Azure AD, soft phones, and just desktop PC's/laptops and printers. Also no VPN requirement since we don't host anything. My requirement is to have something very easy to manage, uncomplicated, yet provide great protection.\n When I replace the Sophos and purchase 7 new firewalls, I'm looking at the following.\n Palo Alto - Seems to be geared towards enterprise, no doubt one of if not the best in the industry for protection. May be too much to manage 7 of these without network engineer level experience on top of all my other duties?\n Fortinet - Seems to be a great solution, runner up to Palo Alto, maybe cheaper depending on the model. Easier to manage but still plenty of protection?\n Cisco Meraki - Seems to be expensive for what it is, less feature sets, but very easy and reliable. However again we have a simple network so don't need many features just something that works. Licensing is a little expensive, and if you don't pay up, your firewall stops working.\n So with my requirements and the firewalls I'm looking at, any recommendations if you were in my shoes?\n    submitted by    /u/LoneSysAdm  \n [link]   [comments]",

He's pretty good in most respects, but is definitely on the side of the owners of the company when it comes to what he focuses on and how he chooses to resolve things.\n Well, recently, I and the rest of the department- and soon all departments- have been asked to provide all my work account passwords- not vendor accounts, domain admin accounts, server passwords, etc. That's all already in a KeePass database that the owners have access too. No, now they want to be able to log in to any account at the company \"in case something happens.\" In other words- they want us to store every user's password where it's available for them. Again, the framing is \"in case something happens.\"\n ​\n Currently- I think they're afraid of losing knowledge/access, because they sense they've got 1.5 of my 2 feet out the door already, and the IS Manager/my Jr. Sysadmin are not quite ready to handle everything I do.

Its just bizarre and something that I notice a lot. \n Yesterday, my coworker approached the team with a server \"issue\" he found on one of our monitoring programs and proposed a potential solution.\n Here's the thing:\n I found this issue back in March. Brought it to my team's attention, investigated it and documented my findings. Then coordinated with the networking team to discuss resolving it. \n We found that the \"issue\" has literally zero impact on performance, and the act of resolving it would require bringing down the server's application. And my bosses boss said that he didn't think that tradeoff was worth it. Bringing down an important application for several hours to \"fix\" something that doesn't affect the server or the application, whose only impact is a very occasional alert on a monitoring program. \n The ultimate resolution was to leave it as-is. \n So I told my coworker that, showed him my work, and forwarded him the email where everyone agreed that it was a non-issue. \n But apparently that wasn't good enough, and he proceeded to bring the application down on his own, with no conferring with the team, against the wishes of everyone else who already worked on the problem, to perform the \"fix\". \n I swear, this guy sometimes just does things for the only reason of creating the appearance that he's \"fixing\" problems that aren't actually there.\n We haven't had our daily meeting yet so no one has discussed his decision to do this on his own yet. So we'll see how that goes. But geez. \n He otherwise does good work, and I'm not casting stones because I have my faults too. So I just find it odd that he chooses to do things like this.\n    submitted by    /u/AnarchyPigeon2020  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello. I am a total noob for tape backups and am a little lost here. I would appreciate any advice.\n I have been working in tech for a long time and manage a lot of infrastructure, but I have never needed to back something up to tape. Currently I work at a research institute and we have to keep data for a very long time, and we want to fill up a fire safe with a bunch of tapes for this reason.\n My data environment is a mix of offline hard drives, NAS, and some compute clusters.\n My problem is I do not really know what to do here. Dell keep trying to get me to buy massive units that will fill up my racks and store a bunch of tapes inside them as a managed system, but all I need is a way to write to the tapes and then remove the tapes to the safe. I think to this end I can either get an external tape drive, or a small server with a tape drive in it so everyone relevant can access? Am I correct here that I dont need any substantial hardware.\n Secondly they keep asking me about software, what I am going to use to write the tapes for storage. Having looked in to it it seems it is not so simple as drag and drop, and I need a software package to write the data to the tapes. My question here is, does anyone have recommendations for a lightweight software program I can use in an enterprise environment for this? I dont need anything comprehensive just occasional writing to single, unmanaged tapes.\n Apologies if these are silly questions. I have been struggling to find simple directions for what I need to purchase.\n ​\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Akio_Cuki  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am thinking of transitioning to the civilian sector, kinda done with military lifestyle and want to be with my family. I have reservations for finding a quality salary to match the pay and benefits I have now.\n I've been in the field for about 7 years but realistically, IT only fills like 30-40 of my time at work. Mostly AD user management, vm management, help desk services and network management. I feel like my skill set is too wide and I can't command a high salary for a senior sysadmin or project manager.\n If I don't transition, I'll end up being forced into more personnel management which is not what I want to do. I want to remain technical.\n I just graduated in the fall with a BS in CompSci and have Sec+.

          "description": "I hope you're all doing well. I recently got a new server for setting up our own virtual environment, moving away from using an MSP and ESXi. We opted for some Dell servers, nothing too fancy since we'll only be running about 3 or maybe 4 Windows VMs.\n Here's the thing: I've been going through the Dell documentation, trying to understand how to set up BitLocker on this server. I've used BitLocker before on laptops and old servers, where it would prompt for the key or passphrase upon reboot. But now, it seems like because this server has a TPM 2.0 chip, that might not be necessary?\n I've come across conflicting guides and articles from Dell, so I'm feeling a bit confused. Our server has two drives: one for the OS and another for data storage (a few 2TB drives). When I go to manage BitLocker, I have the option to save the recovery key to a file or print it. So, I saved the key on a USB drive and made additional backups on OneDrive, our NAS, and SaaS backup. For now, I've only enabled BitLocker on the OS drive using the \"used space only\" option since it's currently empty.\n But here's the weird part: after rebooting, it didn't ask for the key. Many of the guides I've found talk about selecting the TPM module and setting up auto-unlock options, but my server just boots up without any prompts. I'm assuming that for the second drive, I can simply right-click it and enable BitLocker in the same way.\n Is this normal behavior with a server that has a TPM chip? Does it automatically unlock BitLocker? To be honest, that's what I'm hoping for, especially since I plan to move to remote management soon (if it's allowed). I want things to be easy during patching nights and remote maintenance.\n I'd appreciate any insights or clarification on this matter.

Because we use Port replicators that gave issues. (just mentioning this because maybe it helps with the main problem).\n The Wifi problem - Almost no internet at our buildings (250Kbps to 2.5Mbps), when working from home no problem: \n Only on certain laptops. \n Working laptop has between 80Mbps-100Mbps\n followed this whole guide: https://www.thetechwire.com/internet-slow-on-one-computer-but-fast-on-another/\n Compared laptop(s) with another laptop and everything is the same(drivers/updates/hardware/... .\n Took the Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201 Intern WLAN 2400 Mbit/s from a \"working\" laptop to a not working laptop. Issue remains.\n Switched the power plan to balanced (i gained 2-3Mbps).\n The Wifi isn't REALLY bad at some places. When the faulty laptop connects to AP1 you can have 3.5MBps and when the laptop connects on AP2 it can only have 250Kbps.\n It doesn't matter if only 1 laptops is connected to that AP or 10. Issue stays the same.\n We already restarted all the AP's(didn't replace an AP though).\n When i take a look on our firewall the decibels are for the working and faulty laptop the same.\n We have a Fortinet FortiGate 100F Firewall\n \n \n  \n-------------\n What i think the problem is: Our firewalls. The problem is that i don't know how to pinpoint the cause of the problem. Is there any tool that can push me in the right direction or does someone have some cool tips & tricks?\n ​\n If you have any questions, i'll try to anwser them asap.\n Ps: i'm not an network engineer.

Today I was humbled by a loss of DNS into AD in one of the SBS servers, I was going nowhere, into the wee hours.\n So Chattie & I went for it. \n Question 17 (still no results) the AI threw up an old Server Fault post along with several others.\n https://serverfault.com/questions/566304/dns-event-id-4000-on-sbs-2011\n Chattie: The command nltest /sc_change_pwd:<fqdn> is used to reset the secure channel password between a domain controller and the domain. \n The secure channel password is used to encrypt all communications between the domain controller and the domain. \n If the secure channel password becomes out of sync between the domain controller and the domain, then you may experience problems \n with Active Directory replication, authentication, and other services that rely on Active Directory.\n ​\n UnNamed Fella: We solved this issue by running the following command on our domain server:\n nltest /sc_change_pwd:<fqdn>\n Afterwards we had to restart the server.\n ​\n Chattie: You should replace <fqdn> with the fully qualified domain name of the domain controller. \n For example, if the domain controller’s fully qualified domain name is dc1.contoso.com, \n then you would run the command nltest /sc_change_pwd:dc1.contoso.com.\n ​\n Me: we were both wrong. Here is the results of two attempts - the last just using the domain:\n C:\\Windows\\system32>nltest /sc_change_pwd:tcib-sbs.tcib.local\n I_NetLogonControl failed: Status = 1355 0x54b ERROR_NO_SUCH_DOMAIN\n Better: \n C:\\Windows\\system32>nltest /sc_change_pwd:tcib.local\n Flags: 0\n Connection Status = 0 0x0 NERR_Success\n The command completed successfully.\n nltest. I must get that tattooed somewhere . . .\n So, Guestdc if that's your name, I've no idea where you pulled that from, but I owe you.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Sudsguts  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am spending half of my day fixing the problems that are caused by the company systems set up in the first place. \n I am now looking to move forward and I am struggling to find a job which is closer to the business but further away from sysadmin / day to day support. I honestly do not want to do it anymore, I enjoy talking to stakeholders and even explaining tech issues to non-tech colleagues and I'm good at it. I have good soft skills too.\n Which jobs would be good to apply to?\n    submitted by    /u/rudyxp  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings. I am making this post to seek assistance from fellow system administrators that have come across difficulty at getting a job at one point or another in their careers. \n I worked as a system administrator in the DoD for several years. I still have a clearance. Recently got out several months ago. I am working through a Cybersecurity degree and I have the following certifications: Network+, Security+, CySA+, Server+, Linux+ and Blue Team Level 1. My experience is quite broad, during my time in I was the head system administrator for a 50+ server network of virtualized Windows and Linux servers. There really isn't a single thing I am expert level at. The nature of my job required me to dip my toes in SQL, Cisco, Alcatel, Linux, Windows, fiber repair, Active Directory, Exchange, and many other things. Despite several revisions to my resume as well as professional resume reviews, getting a job post military has been very difficult. I have upskilled in the security analyst side of things, getting a decent handle on digital forensics tools and incident handling and investigation through tools like Splunk. I did this to sort of round out my skills and open up the possibility of going a more cyber focused route. But again I find myself at a point in which my skills and experience are super broad. \n I have applied to hundreds and hundreds of positions. Only received one interview of which I did really well during. They asked very simple sysadmin related questions about DHCP, Exchange, Active Directory. Baby stuff. Yet two weeks later I was told I didn't get it. At this point I decided to specialize and get better at Linux. I am not sure what to do really. I know many are struggling with the job market. It has been absolutely demoralizing and at some point my savings are going to run up. I have even applied to numerous jobs below my skill and experience level with no success. I don't know what to do.\n    submitted by    /u/marble_grapevine  \n [link]   [comments]",

Secondly, our current environment for background is 4 Hyper-V hosts running Server 2012 R2 with each machine running 2 VMs\n So, has anyone done an in-place upgrade of Server 2012 R2 to Server 2019 of a Hyper-V host that's running VMs? I appreciate that the relevant VMs will be down for a period during this (if it works) which I'm cool with as we're a Mon-Fri 9-5 business but I'm more concerned about any pitfalls or issues that could occur during this that I haven't thought of (mainly because I've not done it this way before)\n The plan was to shut down the VMs, disable auto start, throw up the 2019 ISO on the host and just follow the prompts for in-place as though it was a standard server (I've done plenty of in-place on the average server). Is there anything that will stop me from doing this? Anything I need to look out for?

Basically they would open them, print a report from them, close the file, then try and open another .mdb file (there are 4 of these) and they would just get a spinning circle of doom and you would have to open task manager and end the task. \n These files live on a network drive and I tried several things but nothing seemed to permanetly fix the issue. The odd thing was that on any other PC the files works fine for these same users and they never got the spinning circle of death.\n Well I had talked to them and gave them a work around of going into task manager and finding a second Access task and ending that and then the files opened fine, and I got a verbal confirmation from the users that this was good enough so I stopped working on the issue.\n ​\n Fast forward to today where I get a call from their supervisor pissed that this issue is occuring for them and when is it going to be fixed. Yeah, it's my fault for not CYOA, but I recalled at that moment that whenever they had this issue the .accdb access files would open fine no matter what.\n So I opened each .mdb in edit mode where I could see all the forms, macros, tables, etc and I just copied all of them and pasted into a new .accdb file and named it the same thing. From what i could tell everything seemed to be working fine. They were not some crazy complex things, just a few tables, forms, queries, and macros.\n I really won't know 100% though until end of week, but that should be fine right?

It's a VM so I just reboot it and now it's stuck in a blue screen/reboot loop. Okay whatever, needed an excuse to retire/upgrade that server anyways, and I've got a physical DHCP 2016 server on hot-standby so not too big of an issue.\n Come in this morning and now the issue has spread to our Printing Server and Domain Controller VMs. Print server actually seemed fine with a reboot but the DC got stuck in a boot loop just like DHCP. Also not a big deal since I've got a physical 2022 server that actually serves as the primary DC but still this just seems wild to me that it all happened at once.\n Granted none of this has been a real show-stopper since we've got redundancy but I was just wondering if anyone else had run into 2012R2 suddenly offing itself recently. Or just any other fun monday morning blues.\n I'll also update this thread if I figure out anything. Servers seem to be booting when I remove their networking adapters in Hyper-V so that's a thing\n    submitted by    /u/DH_Net_Tech  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have our guest network segregated by VLAN and it cannot communicated with any other internal networks. However, our Guest to WAN (internet) firewall rule only allows HTTP/HTTPS and a few other web and email related ports. Lately we have had some people complain about certain smart phone apps not working on the guest wifi. After doing some digging I found that some apps require other ports to be allowed in order to fully work. One example is the Sonic Drive-In app, it would not allow you to get to the check out screen. When I did a packet trace it showed port 5671 was blocked. I opened it as a test and now the app works. I have a few other apps with similar connection issues.\n Does anyone just allow Guest to WAN with ANY service allowed?

We had the cable company look but they said there was no signs of water on the outside. The conclusion is there must be some area in the conduit under the foundation that allowed water to seep in.

I need a script or tool that detects file changes or deletion in a specific folder and restores the files by deleting the newly created files and copying the original files over from a backup folder. \n The reason why I need this is because I'm running a program that keeps deleting two files and creating two new ones with the same name that keep breaking the whole thing and I am tired to keep copying the two old files back and forth. Before I could just mark the two files as read only with the windows tools which kept them untouched, but as of now since a new update of the program it now deletes the files and makes new ones. \n ​\n Thanks in advance! :)\n    submitted by    /u/iMD20  \n [link]   [comments]",

When a user opens Edge (after signing into their office apps as above), there is a message to complete the sign-in. \n “Work – <User Email Address>\n Not Syncing\n We’ve detected this account on your device and we need to verify it before you can complete sign in, and set up sync.” \n If you click on the “complete Sign in” button, the user is then signed in with no additional prompt or MFA.

          "description": "I'll try not to make this too long, here is the basic recap of the situation:\n I was hired as the first security engineer for a company with around 300 total users. They have absolutely 0 infrastructure or security tools in the environment currently.\n  \nAll windows machines running windows 10 home\n no active directory\n no endpoint protection\n all machines currently have the same login credentials and each user then logs into office 365 and other apps using their own credentials\n  \nThe infra/security team was recently created when the CTO hired a sysadmin (2 months ago), 1 tech support guy, and myself. I didn't really receive any sort of training since well there's nothing really to train. I asked the CTO for any diagrams or info about the current setup and she gave a single network diagram with switches and 1 gateway (which we can't access - it was setup by a third-party and they didn't leave a config file or credentials). I decided to try to use the CIS controls as a base point to suggest security improvements. Basically I wrote a proposal with the help of the new sysadmin saying we should get Windows 10/11 Pro, install AD, and use Defender for endpoint protection (this would required upgrading from O365 business standard to O365 business premium). \n Long story short, the CTO rejected the proposals saying she's not convinced that what we proposed will solve the security issues. She said to focus on security policies and to prepare for ISO certification.\n My question is what the fuck do I do here? Has anyone ever had a CTO who either didn't know what AD was or was really against its use? Is there any other way to manage machines remotely that is more cost-efficient? Should I just look for a new job that has more reasonable leadership?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/faubsam2020  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then gave us tools which created 20GB+ log files in the span of 15 mins and said they couldn't assist us any further so that ended up getting parked. The actual MS \"SME\" on the call was mediocre next to a helpdesk tech.\n As part of the analysis/fix we accidentally disabled a setting in Group Policy which effectively broke a lot of app services and caused other issues as it stopped the SOE / IE from being able to call out to the internet properly.\n At no point did the MS techs warn us of this and when we spent a day running through everything to figure out the problem and identified it was issues with the SOE using the PAC we sent more logs to Microsoft who literally just said \"yes it looks like you have a problem communicating with the internet we should do a log network trace\" and it's only after handing over to the EMEA support (which nobody communicated to us, we were just sat waiting a few hours) that we got a good way forward. \n The only time I've seen (Non MSP) vendor support any worse was dealing with Oracle's APAC managers and DBA support.\n    submitted by    /u/TheUrbanisedZombie  \n [link]   [comments]",

The plan is to have an e-mail address \"support@ourcompany.com\" that pumps the tickets into the ticketing system (osTicket) and only accepts mail from us to prevent other people from creating random tickets.\n The support of our mail hoster said we could create rules for this using the Sieve language. I've tried multiple variations that should imo get this done, but it's not working.\n Current version of the script:\n if address :contains :domain \"from\" [\"ourcompany.com\", \"ourcompany2.com\", \"ourcompany3.com\"] { keep; stop; } else { discard; } \n I've tried with :matches :domain and with :contains :all but sending test mail from an outlook.com address still lets through the e-mail. I also tried with if not address ... discard; but that yields the same, unsatisfying, result.\n Has anyone run into this before?\n Edit: I accomplished what I wanted to do, even if not in the exact way I'd have liked.\n I created two ticket filters in osTicket to do this. I need two filters because if I only apply the second filter, all e-mail gets rejected for some reason and no tickets are created.\n Filter 1: \"E-Mail accept\" \n Priority: 1 Stop execution on filter match: Yes Filter any of criteria: User Email contains \"ourcompany.com\" User Email contains \"ourcompany2.com\" User Email contains \"ourcompany3.com\" Do: Set help topic to \"Support\" \n Filter 2: \"E-Mail reject\"\n Priority: 2 Stop execution on filter match: No Filter any of criteria: User Email NOT contains \"ourcompany.com\" User Email NOT contains \"ourcompany2.com\" User Email NOT contains \"ourcompany3.com\" Do: Disable notification on new ticket Discard ticket \n    submitted by    /u/electric_medicine  \n [link]   [comments]",

The software is monolithic & can't run in multiple instances. So, we're forced to deploy new hardware to each location. My idea would've been to consolidate all of the hardware onto a pair of powerful servers (one located at our offices, the other one off-site) and virtualize all 100+ machines onto these servers – that way, if one of these VM servers were to fall over, the team would be able to rapidly spin up a new server & get the branch up and running very quickly (15 minutes max). this idea got shot down. \n \nWe use a mix of local AD, Google Workspace & M365 as our environment. I've been trying to convince both my team lead (who's the IT manager) and boss (the CIO/CTO) to try and unify everything under one vendor for ease of deployment, management & troubleshooting for the long term – once again, the idea got shot down. \n \nAll our infrastructure is not managed by any form of MDM, I pitched this idea, and it got promptly shot down. \n \n I really like the current workplace, but trying to convince them to change/rebuild the current infrastructure for the better, just results in resistance from them. I’ve tried to talk to them to see why they are resisting change/shooting down any ideas. the only reasons that I got from the CIO/CTO was that it's due to financial & \"if it isn't broken, don't fix it\" reasons.

There are several users popping in requests for Google accounts for collaborating with other orgs that are using Google. Most of them have been creating personal gmail accounts.\n At my previous gig we were a Google shop and needed Microsoft 365 for some folks. We had onprem AD and were able to sync logins across all platforms. Am I crazy for thinking we can do the reverse in this case? We have azure ad instead of onprem. I would imagine I can disable gmail and restrict Google drive to make sure we maintain data governance, but that is all conjecture at this point as I’ve never done it before.\n Any thoughts from people who have done it before? Will disabling gmail totally break other apps? I’m probably missing a lot but open to suggestions. My team thinks we should investigate the use cases more as there’s a perception we don’t really need Google accounts to collaborate like this. They may be right but it could end up being more work trying to walk multiple external orgs through proper sharing processes so we can work with them.\n    submitted by    /u/Spudthegreat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all. I've asked this question before on other subs, but none have been able to figure it out.\n I have two fairly old Macs desktops, running windows, and I'm trying to wipe everything and just use Linux (Ubuntu).\n I'm struggling with getting them to boot from USB. I've tried ventoy (not supported on Macs), and making a bootable USB through Linux mints' standard \"make a bootable USB\" option. Both give me \"secure boot 14\" error. But googling that gives we information about windows?\n At this point I just want to nuke the machines, wipe everything and just have Ubuntu. I don't care about the windows partition because it runs too slow to be of any use anyway. There is no important data on them as the owners have resorted to just using their laptops.\n One machine has only windows on it, and it was still stuck at the splash screen after leaving it overnight. The other has a working windows OS on it - this is the main one I'm trying to save. Both throw up the same \"secure boot 14\" error.\n And to top it all off, they're all using Chinese language operating systems. So I'm reliant on Google translate from my phone to figure stuff out.\n Just for laughs: one of the business owners suggested solving the problem by buying a third Mac, and putting windows on it. Before throwing the keyboard at them (metaphorically speaking), I enquired as to why they:\n 1) didn't just use Mac OS in the first place because they just use it for excel, word, and Photoshop 2) didn't use a windows based machine 3) thought that buying a third Mac would solve the problem\n They don't know how to use Mac OS; Macs look nicer; a new Mac would be faster.\n    submitted by    /u/mattizie  \n [link]   [comments]",

The modified URL needs to be loaded from the pop-up window, not from a different browser window, so a little console trickery is needed...\n Below are the steps to replicate my workaround: \n  \nOpen CloudSync\n Click the + icon to create a new link\n Select Box and click Next\n The popup authentication window appears (with the 403 Forbidden error)\n Copy the entire URL\n Pressed Ctrl-Shift-I to bring up the Browser Developer Tools\n Switch to the console tab\n Type the following into the console (note the single apostrophe at the end):\n self.location = ‘\n Paste the URL copied in step 5\n Locate &state=http://x.x.x.x:5000 at the end of the URL and change it to:\n &state=http%3A%2F%2Fx.x.x.x:5000 (i.e. replacing the first : with %3A and each / with %2F. Don’t change anything else)\n Type a closing ’\n Press enter\n The Box authentication window should appear and you should be able to grant permission successfully.\n \n My sync is up and running after 8 days and lots of inconvenience.\n And now we wait for an official fix!\n    submitted by    /u/neillsun  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the last 2 years of support for them, we had like 3 or 4 devices that failed. To be fair, some were straight up old and gave up mostly because of that, however the others suffered from enviromental problems. A warehouse is full of various kinds of dirt & dust in the air that settles down everywhere. Employees touch things with dirty hands and so on.\n ​\n I thought it might be better to instead replace most TCs now with some higher quality devices (and switch at that time over to Igel OS) that last longer because they are designed for that enviroment.

          "description": "Hello, \n We're making our super-late upgrade from Exchange 2010 to 2016 (and after that to 2019), after inheriting an old environment and finding out updates not working. \n After installing Exchange 2016 on a new server, we've ran into issues with migrating mailboxes: \"Unsupported source mailbox version Version 14.0 ‎(Build 639.0)‎.\"\n That version should stand for Exchange 2010 RTM. The 2010 server itself is supposed to be patched. \n What I've checked:\n - In the EMC the server version shows \"14.0 (Build 639.21)\" - EMC is said to be inaccurate: Application binary versions (checked from the running store.exe location, no second wrong install locations) are 14.3.513.0, which should be the very last rollup of SP3\n - Get-ExchangeServer AdminDisplayVersion also shows \"14.0 (Build 639.21)\"\n - The current Exchange schema version is rangeUpper 15332 (or Exchange 2016 CU18)\n - The \"Exchange Servers\" AD group only contains current running (the 2010 and 2016) servers\n - In ADSIEdit, Configuration/Services/Microsoft Exchange/[domain]/Administrative Groups/Exchange Administrative Group (...)/Servers also only contains the current running servers\n What I've tried:\n - First, most of the instructions that were followed are from the Exchange Deployment Assistant\n - Trying to run the upgraded installer for 2010 just to be sure but it says nothing to upgrade\n - Searching for any non-installed updates through Windows update, including hidden ones - Restarted services and machines so no lingering processes should exist\n - Creating a new database on the 2010 server and moving mailboxes to it in case the database has an affected version as well \n Misc:\n - We currently do not intend to move to Exchange Online\n My current understanding would be that mailboxes also have a version and have to be upgraded. How do I go about doing that? Otherwise, what issue am I not seeing?\n    submitted by    /u/WalkFrontAgentParty  \n [link]   [comments]",

So for share permissions I have Everyone full control. For the NTFS permissions I have SYSTEM(FULL), LOCAL ADMINS(FULL), and DOMAIN COMPUTERS(READ). The LOCAL ADMINS group on the file server has domain admins inside of it. Everything is working fine and the application inside of it is being deployed without issue while at the same time no users have any access to the folder except DOMAIN ADMINS.\n Now the strange thing is if I'm on the file server with my domain admin account and I try to open the folder by either the filesystem or the share I get prompted with the message \"You don't currently have permissions to access this folder. Click continue to permanently get access to the folder.\" Remember the local admins on the file server has the domain admins in the group. Not sure why it's telling me I don't have access. Now if I click continue it adds my DA account to the NTFS permissions explicitly. This is screwing up our folder permissions consistency. If I didn't truly have access as the message stated how did it explicitly add my DA account with full control? That seems kind of messed up if that was really the case.\n One final note. If I'm on my office machine and run computer management as my DA connecting the file server and then navigate to the shares, when opening the folder I don't get prompted with the message above. If I look at the NTFS permissions everything is correct. WTF? I have to say I'm confused by this one.

It seems I can't do a poll type post to get a vote, so would appreciate your thoughts as comments below.\n If you do use desktops, what kind / size / form factor? Larger towers, mini towers, SFF, Micro, etc?\n EDIT - Thank you everyone for the replies so far, I'll endeavour to individually comment and thank each of you by replying to your comments as I have time :) It's very much appreciated to ensure we educate our students to join the industry in the future and be well equipped with knowledge by the time they graduate\n    submitted by    /u/humm3r1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyways, I got an email when I sign up for a domain name through the company Hover. I've had a few issues with this company, including very slow emails sinking, and troubles with linking it to my Gmail account, but something that I find it very weird and doesn't make sense to me is why a lot of times when I try to sign up for some thing using my email address it says that my email is invalid. For example if I go to a grocery store and try to sign up for their rewards card or something, usually it says that my email is not valid and they asked me if I spelled it right, etc. When this happens I often feel defensive like \"listen pal, I pay for this email address and it's definitely legit - do you want me to prove it to you? what's your email address? I'll email you right now!\" lol. Only half joking. But seriously, why is this happening, and is there a way to fix it? I did use my email name to be [info@myname.com](mailto:info@myname.com) - so perhaps some people think it's a fake name, and like a chump like me couldn't possibly have such a personalized email, but is it a problem with Hover? Or is it a problem with my email settings?

So far I've looked into Printix, ezeep, PaperCut Hive - those solutions would cost me 3500$ or more per year - way too much for me.\n Can you recommend cheaper alternatives?

In the past I tried PaperCut Mobility Print but I couldn't find a way to control who can print.\n Thank you in advance\n    submitted by    /u/JanarReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of them being that a basic tier VPN GW can only use Certs for P2S and its SSTP.\n So therefor we are going to be using certs. the vpn gw has a self signed root cert. and all clients need a client cert signed by the root.\n we want to be able to deploy individual certs to each employee to allow for evoking access to individual users.\n Manually making client certs for each employee is not feasible. so i want to deploy a script via intune that makes this cert for each employee.\n now here comes the problems, i need to sign these certs with a remote root. but i cant for the life of me find out how. we have the root in a key vault. but every article talking about using csr is for for signing something to the kv. \n how do i sign with a remote root cert from the client device via a powershell script.\n    submitted by    /u/EmSSoH  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is something that may have been covered already if so, I apologize.\n My company has roughly 400 employees and 3 IT staff and I'm the only one who works on any of the O365 management, and I'm looking for some advice here. We recently went with KnowBe4 for security training, and we are utilizing the phish alert button. Currently it's setup to send an email to our team with an attachment of the email (I think this is the default) but with how many employees we have vs how many people are monitoring and managing it the folder I have them going to is filling up rather fast.\n Does anyone else using this service have any tips or tricks to possibly automating this to grab the header information of the emails using PowerShell or even power automate? This is my first admin job so I am kind of a beginner to power automate and the exchange module in PowerShell. I currently have 250+ emails that are reported as phishing and it seems counter productive to open each one then go into the properties and scroll through the header info to find the domain or IP and block it in exchange. I also know I would need to proof some of them as some people report emails that their bosses send to them lol. \n I do know in KnowBe4 there is an option if using the add-in via exchange to add header info to the email when reported but that isn't working for me for some reason, I also would prefer to learn more on the automation side if possible.\n I know they also have a package you can purchase that would help with this via KnowBe4 but just getting KnowBe4's service for a security audit was a nightmare due to an \"IT Budget\" not existing. \n ​\n TLDR: Looking for recommendations or pointers in the right direction to automate the KnowBe4 Phish Alert Button to grab the header information from emails that are reported by users and sent to me to help efficiently block them in exchange.\n    submitted by    /u/nice_crocs  \n [link]   [comments]",

It appears randomly people will report the attachment either takes extremely long or doesn't end up finishing scanning. Now since my few years in IT, I feel like I would always hear this was a thing for Microsoft and this service. To me, it sounds like something out of my control (or anyone of us in this position). I speculate this can result from how the service is running and how many attachments are being filtered by Microsoft at that time. The only possible actions I can either attempt to change my safe attachment setting to send an email upon full scan (which doesn't appear to be a thing anymore from what I've seen) or forward the original email yourself to have the email rescanned.

          "description": "Currently not using Apple Business Manager but I do have iOS devices in an MDM. Going to move things to Intune and drop the current MDM. One thing that the old MDM couldn't do was automatically upgrade iOS devices. For the current MDM to do that it needed devices to be in the ABM. The current MDM can also control a lot of settings (CIS policy recommendations) but some settings required the devices to be in the ABM so those can't be set by it. So to me, it looks like Apple only lets an MDM solution have access to whatever it decides to allow it to manage. Of course that could just be the MDM I'm using. Now with the move to Intune I'm being told by the consultant that it can push iOS updates without the ABM being used. Is this true? Also, does Intune have access to all of the iOS settings/controls without the ABM? I would like to be wrong here but I'd rather get in front of it now if the ABM is needed. Last thing I want is to find out later that I was right and using ABM is necessary to have full control over the apple devices.\n    submitted by    /u/pw1111  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I was thinking about using Grafana, there is some module I can use with Apache mod_status extended. But this sounds like not really \"professional\", it uses a github module to export status on prometheus, and then I have to re-code some part to get the extended status which interests me... Also I saw I can monitor databases with Grafana, so it sounds fine to me. Maybe some of you have good or even better solutions?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/antomaa12  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Has anyone gotten smart card authentication working using pam_pkcs, pcsc-lite and coolkey for a virtual machine in subject hosted in VMware workstation player/pro? I've got it partially working to recognize the card, prompt for pin, check user principal name in the card certs to match against AD account, then finally login. But issue comes when machine goes to lock enabled screensaver after some idle time, the user tries to unlock but it never prompts for PIN though it might say please insert your card. If you manually lock and unlock within a few minutes, it seems to load the smart card module and prompt for PIN then login in. If it's been idle for a longer time, it fails to recognize the smart card and user has to reboot machine for it to be recognized again. Reading online the solutions I've come across are using VMware horizon client but I don't have licensing or setup for that. The issue is also supposedly fixed in RHEL 8 with a newer version of pcsc-lite. I have also turned on gdm debugging and have seen a few errors regarding account expiration policy not found and the pam_pkcs module failing to load. Not sure why if during initial login it works 100% of the time. I'm thinking it's unreliable USB redirection with the VMware player and card reader so I'm gonna try installing the image directly on a machine to circumvent using VMware player/workstation software.\n    submitted by    /u/kenyakickz25  \n [link]   [comments]",

In order to keep systems available and secure at the same time, a thorough and working patch management technology (along with people and processes but out of scope of the question here) needs to be manageable, too.\n RHEL has Satellite, Windows has WSUS and so many 3rd parties exist for the ecosystem. If the environment is not fully RHEL, Satellite is not enough. WSUS does not patch 3rd party applications, so we need another solution for that. Also, you need two solutions if you pick the default ones, so a 3rd party looks like better but comes with cost. So many trade-offs.\n Aside from all the marketing online and tools in Google search result first 5 pages, what do you do to solve this puzzle?

The project covers 4 different facilities and quite large networks. We're still a little ways out from configuration, but I'm trying to do some homework so I'm more prepared when we get to configuration.\n The basic SPAN/RSPAN stuff seems fairly simple and straightforward, but I guess what I'm struggling to find is any documentation or literature on how to properly \"place\" SPAN and RSPAN ports/configuration. Mostly just some considerations or best practices for properly and efficiently designing a SPAN/RSPAN configuration.

We have two Datacenters utilizing Cisco ACI with 100G DCI between them. I'm not a data center guy, I'm a transport/radio guy.\n My task is to properly connect the MPLS environment to the two Datacenters. (Currently only commented via legacy DC equipment at one Datacenter only) this task wasnt completed by our senior in 3 years they had to do it and now that person is gone so I'm up.\n My thought is to connect to each DC via EBGP where my MPLS nodes are AS1 and the DC environments are AS2-5 (vPC pairs with separate AS numbers. Idk If that's good design, I didn't set it up and I don't know DC/ACI. I'd almost think each vPC pair would share an AS but have separate AS per DC.)\n Regardless, I'd set route policies to only allow DC to DC traffic to traverse the DCI and any user traffic. From DCA site to DC2 site would traverse the MPLS backbone.\n What general approach would you all take to this? I can provide more details if needed just let me know. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/somerandomguy6263  \n [link]   [comments]",

In order to whitelist IPs for our remote workers we have to split tunnel that MS Traffic in to exit our ISP for the whitelisting. \n I'm using Palo Alto Global Protect and domain forwarding to accomplish this since there are regional IPs all over and VPN users all over. \n I've basically added every domain found here: \n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide#skype-for-business-online-and-microsoft-teams\n This seems to work for the whitelisting, I can see the traffic come in and out and it satisfies the client logon. However active Outlook and Teams sessions seem to go offline and can't show online anymore. I've gone through all sorts of logs and captures and so far I haven't been able to narrow down what and why this is happening. Nothing is getting blocked so the only thing I can think of so far is that there is some traffic that is getting missed (either not on the urls listed above, or direct IPs not getting DNS resolved) and splitting the traffic between two egress points causing the session issues. I'm trying to get something setup to where I can test and capture myself so I don't have to rely on client interactions but for now I thought I'd see if anyone has run into this issue. \n I'm wondering if there are less domains I can split just for the login and leave all the others.\n    submitted by    /u/supaflash  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sadly I cannot add a route to the gateway statically or with something like bgp. \n If I assign the IPs to the router, it doesn't forward the packets because they are (from the routers perspective) at the destination.\n If I use KeepaliveD to fill the ARP Cache of the Gateway and then remove the address from the interface it works until the cache gets cleared. \n The Router runs VyOS (a Debian based Firewall / Router). \n Any Ideas and Tips are welcome :)\n    submitted by    /u/pfz4  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are also using the Cloud controller (Aruba Central, on v8.10.0.6_86193, tested with latest 8.10.x as well).\n We've configured a test SSID as we have begun deploying more 6e devices. We're seeing roughly half the throughput on the 6GHz as we see on the 5GHz radio with the same clients, running speed tests and iperf to local destinations (as well as Internet Speed Test reflecting the same). We see this throughput loss across 40MHz, 80MHz and 160MHz wide channels (it scales up as you'd expect with the increased widths, but we still see ~50% loss of throughput compared to 5GHz). …",

          "description": "I have an old slingbox that tries to reach out to the internet for connection to download configuration data several times a minute. This configuration data will brick the slingbox so it is not wanted. \n I see two solutions. One is to have a packet drop rule at the firewall to drop all these packets from the slingbox. I’ve tried this and it works but I hate the excessive logging. \n The second solution is to set a dummy gateway in the slingbox gateway field. Unfortunately the device would not let me set 127.0.0.1 and I had to pick a unused ip on the lan. This works great. Nothing is logged on the firewall and I can access the device from the lan as I don’t need internet access to it. \n So my question is from a network perspective. I’m assuming the dummy gateway on the slingbox to an ip not used on the lan will create additional arp request looking for it every time the slingbox tries to connect to internet for its bad config data via that dummy gateway.\n What would have the least network impact. The dummy gateway method or using the real firewall gateway and dropping all packets to internet?\n I’m assuming the dummy gateway method would free up any logging and load on the firewall but at the expense of broadcast additional arp request looking for the unused gateway ip. \n So what’s the better solution?\n    submitted by    /u/Proudx2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone. I've run into an interesting/potentially alarming discovery at the office and I wanted some opinions. I'm primarily a SysAdmin but I do have my CCNA so I'm not entirely useless with networking. Our previous NetAdmin left ~2 years ago and we've (I've) been slowly uncovering everything that's been done here as necessary. To say it's over-complicated is an understatement (~100 subnets for a company of then 40 people, not including the /30s for OSPF PTP).\n Background: Our ISP provides us a /30 as well as a /27 that we specifically requested. The /30 subnet is terminated (is that the proper term?) on the ISP's hardware: they provided us x.x.x.124/30, the gateway is x.x.x.125 on the ISP hardware and our IP is x.x.x.126. The /27 is terminated in our hardware connected to their hardware: with block y.y.y.160/27 our hardware has y.y.y.161 and acts as the gateway. x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 are on separate VLANs routable via a VRF.\n The question: is there any benefit to using VRF in this situation? Or is there any benefit to the subnet being terminated by our hardware rather than the ISP's hardware?\n Side note/question: These IPs and the VRF are configured on a switch, not a router and/or firewall. I've further discovered that both x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 provide console access to the switch PUBLICLY. I've since closed that via access lists, but are there any other security concerns regarding this situation?\n Flaired this as routing but it could qualify as security.

When connected to a Loadmaster and looking at the statistics, I am trying to understand what the Total Conns means. Is that just a connection for an individual service, port, user connection, etc? It is a total connection over 24 hours? The ask is because I do not know why some of my numbers are so high, when the system is a test system and not heavily utilized by more than a few people, however the total connections is over 2000.\n Seems Kemp questions are pretty vague here in this sub, but I am hoping for the best.

What if a host is physically connected (through the topology that might include some switches) to the router acting as Standby?

So I guess this post is for one of two things.... has anyone done anything similar to deal with one-off bugs that would be hard to identify in a lab environment before changes, and 2.... is there a solid Cisco API that I could parse against a keyword or software function (eg: BGP, SNMP, etc) and a list of device types/versions to try and proactively identify these types of issues? I'll be using Python, but language/nuances don't matter too much as I know not everyone here is super familiar with code.... more looking for if anyone knows manual methods or data sources/api's they've leveraged in the past that I can put code to in order to make a web front end that does these checks for us prior to changes.\n Thanks for any info!\n    submitted by    /u/syntax24  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then IIRC I'd set up permissions in their account on the server.\n I've been called upon to set up a VPN for someone, and it looks like things have changed remarkably. Whn I search in order to bone up, most returns are for commercial VPN companies who are focused on providing anonymity on the web.\n Has my method of creating simple VPNs become completely outdated? I assume that security issues and methods are very different nowadays.\n Are there any good resources out there to re-learn basic VPN principles and best practices? Perhaps as I've gotten older my search capabilities have dwindled, or else I'm so hopelessly out of the loop that I don't even know what to search for within the context of small office VPNs.

I understand there is a core exam (ENCOR) which needs to be passed before undertaking a concentration exam. I have very basic scripting knowledge but like idea of network automation and hoping to spark serious interest to this area.\n I may not know enough to properly make a decision on which specialty field to take for the concentration exam, but hypothetically speaking, if I were to choose the DevNet Professional for the concentration exam, would it make more sense for me to take the DEVASC exam rather than ENCOR?\n I would likely enjoy studying for the ENCOR exam since the topics appear very important to know and interesting but because I want to strengthen network programming, the DEVASC exam look nice as well.\n Btw I’m not in a rush to get CCNP certified, it’s something I would like to study slowly in addition to working full-time.\n Open to everyone’s opinion and advice!\n    submitted by    /u/tomatoget  \n [link]   [comments]",

I haven't been able to find any method to do either from a shell script, I tried looking at how people would do it on Cisco hardware and see EEM scripts mentioned, but I don't know how to adapt them to my situation.\n I am very new to configuring routing protocols on linux and writing scripts for such purposes, sorry if this sounds like a stupid question. Thanks a bunch!\n  \nEdit: Found the solution! I'm really stupid for not noticing this earlier, but you can use vtysh -c and chain commands, just like you would use sh -c to chain and send commands to the POSIX shell from a different shell.

We would see this usually when a specific firewall model was about to fail and starts acting buggy and shortly after totally dead (needing reboots and dropping connections the weeks leading up to failure sort of thing). Seen the exact scenario at least 3 times with this hardware.\n Anyhow when the FW would have it's issues devices on the LAN would also stop working bringing, basically the entire switch is affected for locally hosted programs that typically continue to work when internet is down otherwise. We replace the FW with a new model all is fine of course, but it's alwaysbleft me confused.\n My question though is how is the L3 firewall/gateway managing to screw up a dumb switch for L2 communication? I understand while it's having issues internet may not work but this phenomenon feels like it violates everything I learned about the OSI model?? \n I can only think something with ARP getting messed up or basically FW overloading the switch and basically DoS it? \n Simple flat layout.

Cinderblock walls that are concrete filled, so signal doesn't travel well between units. Looking for suggestions on best \"cheap used enterprise\" hardware to look at. Don't have much experience with Cisco, Aruba, Arista, etc. Read dozens of threads and can't tell whats legit and what's a Ford vs Chevy thing. Tried using 30 Google WiFi routers in topology described below and it failed horribly. Tenants are mom and pop so just needing basic wifi across the building plus extensive security system cause building is in the ghetto. \n Cat6 to each unit from roof, forming wired backbone of one hard-wired AP per unit into 2-3 48 port POE switches. Add more wireless APs in each unit to form a hybrid mesh network without have to run more Cat6 everywhere. Wired backbone would also contain dozens of POE security cameras. Wired backbone would have a few switches spread geographically aross the building (left, right, center) and all connected by SPF uplinks.\n I want to avoid licensing fees and recurring costs. Ideally I can buy cheap enterprise hardware on ebay/offerup, link it all up, write a script or two for configuration (or click some buttons on a web portal) and be done. If need to expand, buy more of the same used gear then plug and play to expand the network. Don't want to worry about getting bricked out because a vendor discontinues some cloud product or because my license expired or I didn't buy from approved vendors. Also confused on the internal vs external wireless controller -- seems like sometimes thay is part of the AP and other times it is seperate?\n What brands/models do you all recommend and why? Give me a shopping list that can get it done as cheap, easy and robust as possible.

Initially, a soft reset of the device had re-established serial as well as TCP communications.\n Within hours, all of the serial devices lost communications again. Several different configuration changes were tried to no affect. A TCP/RTU testing utility was unsuccessful in establishing communications to the slaves via the Converter (failed on handshake), but the Web UI for the converters was still accessible. Soft reset did not help this time.\n Ended up changing the statically assigned IP configured on the Converter to a different address, same port (502), on the same subnet. Comms started working, everything stabilized.\n It is still working but I don't understand why.\n    submitted by    /u/murphinate  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is replicated with the second pair in another rack and then the two pairs have a 4 line LACP bond to connect them. All of this is a standalone isolated network.\n My hope for this was a complete redundancy with zero downtime, as our use case is really sensitive to that and any network downtime can cause major headaches.\n Overall this solution seems to work reasonably well and survives reboot of up to 2 devices (one of each pair) at the same time. There however often are small network down times of 1-4 seconds when one device goes down or reconnects after getting back up.\n Is this normal? I've not been able to experience these technologies on one of the more expensive brand devices, so I can't compare, but I'd generally assume bonds are meant to mitigate perceivable network down times.\n    submitted by    /u/Anteros5  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey All, \n Long time lurker, first time posting. \n I've got a bit of a situation that I thought I had a solution to, but am now stumped. Please excuse any ignorance or lack of detail. \n The scenario is, we've got a location that just had a 3rd party install a Fortigate FW needed for remote access to their devices. Said firewall needs direct internet access. Normally this vendor would use an LTE device to accomplish this, but the location is out in the boonies and service sucks, so that option is out the window. \n Our current ISP has a Ciena fiber hand off with two 1 gbe ports (will come back to why this is relevant), one of which is being used to connect to our firewall for Internet access. The demarc for this fiber circuit is in a separate building from where the 3rd party Fortigate fw is located. The two buildings are connected via mm fiber and use Brocade/Ruckus switches. \n My initial thought was to run a link from the open port in the handoff, to our switch in an access port with a newly created vlan in building one, and trunk the vlan across the network to building two where the Fortigate is located (access port again) and assign the interface on the Fortigate one of the IP's from our block. Well, that was the plan until I just got off the phone with our ISP, where the indicated that that open port is actually for an entirely new circuit that we would have to add to our account. So, I'm back to the drawing board. \n As I eluded to early, we do have a block of IP's (/29) that we can use so I'm sure there's a solution, but I'm not sure how to achieve that. While I was only the phone with the ISP, they also indicated that in order to use that block, I'd have to have a L3 device to handle the routing of said block. I don't think leadership will agree to purchasing any equipment for this as things have been extremely tight. \n Apologies if this is all over the place, it's been a hell of a day, and not just for the problem above. \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/Iamjim1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys. My company will be having a new ISP line installed at a new site and I was shown what the IP details were by my colleague. I'm quite confused! This is my first time being involved in this sort of stuff so I'm trying to understand as much as I can.\n In our other offices we have ISP circuits where we have been given a /29 IP range and we just assign the IP of our firewalls from this range and point the default gateway to that of the ISP router so it is a lot simpler.\n Now it's LAN IPs and WAN IPs and I've no idea how they relate to our current setup which is:\n Firewall (DHCP,NAT) > L2 switch > ISP router\n I know we need a router that will point all traffic to the ISP default gateway, that much is clear. There is a /29 range for the LAN side and a /30 for the WAN side.\n The way I see it is that we have to use 2 IPs from the /29 for the firewalls and another IP for the router interface facing the firewall. Then from the /30 range another router interface (pointing to the ISP router) will be configured with an IP and then a default route will point to the ISP's default gateway.\n I think that our setup will then be:\n Firewall (DHCP,NAT) > L2 switch (ISP failover) > Router > ISP router\n Am I on the right track with this or am I completely misunderstanding?\n    submitted by    /u/hweb47  \n [link]   [comments]",

I appreciate any insight you might share.\n On my side I have 1G service delivered from Zayo into an eth port on a Nexus C93180YC-FX running NXOS 9.3(10). Zayo indicated that I should use QinQ and they're delivering the primary on VLAN A, secondary on VLAN B.\n My QinQ-fu isn't strong but at a high level my understanding is that I should be receiving S-tags A and B and using C-tag C, which is what I've configured for VLAN ID in Azure. Do I have that backwards? Microsoft's routing examples, though for IOS-XE, seem to indicate the reverse.\n I am consulting this article for configuring QinQ on the 9K.\n My issue is that all of the documentation I'm reading is around multiple inner tags with one outer tag. I believe I need the reverse. I've tried both the Configuring VLAN Mapping for Selective Q-in-Q on a 802.1Q Tunnel Port and Configuring Selective Q-in-Q with Multiple provider VLANs examples. I enter the first VLAN mapping switchport vlan mapping vlan-id-range dot1q-tunnel outer vlan-id and when I try to enter a second mapping with the same inner VLAN ID I receive an error about a conflicting mapping for the inner VLAN already existing on this port.\n Other info:\n I tried a configuration with just the primary to see if I could get BGP peering but nothing is coming up.\n interface EthernetXYZ description erc switchport mode dot1q-tunnel switchport vlan mapping C dot1q-tunnel A spanning-tree bpdufilter enable ! interface VlanC description erc no shutdown ip address 10.10.3.1/30 ! ! router bgp PRIVATEAS log-neighbor-changes neighbor 10.10.3.2 remote-as 12076 ` \n    submitted by    /u/Selcouthit  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I don't know if the fact that all the devices being configured in the same subnet would allow me to assign them to different VLANs, as far as I understand, each VLAN in a L3 switch should have a different subnet.

However the Xray machine shows a window of 50000, and the Server its communicating with shows 64240 for the window size. \n Is there a way on Server 2019 to set that window size?

          "description": "So I am trying to understand the benefit of VLANs and how they work still. Hopefully I can clearly and concisely explain my setup and confusion.\n In this example network topology, there is currently zero VLAN or network segmentation. We have one WAN feeding a Fortinet Firewall, with the Fortinet configured for DHCP relay pointing to a 2012 R2 server. This server only has one scope that all devices live in. The scope is 10.10.8.1/22 (but only handing IPs out from 10.10.8.10 - 10.10.9.248). Then the Fortinet is feeding a few miscellaneous switches that are essentially dummy switches all daisy chained together feeding them. There is zero configuration on them.\n So now I have a new HP 1920S switch I would like to integrate. And I would like to segment 36 out of the 48 ports of this switch into 3 different VLANs that cannot interact with our main 10.10.8.1/22 network. The groups being VLAN10; ports 1-12, VLAN20; ports 13-24, and VLAN30; ports 25-36, while using port 48 as a trunk for the 3 VLANs. This \"trunk\" (HP terms) is being fed into the piggybacked dummy switches. But when I test the isolation of these VLANs by plugging in two devices across two different VLAN segments, I can still ping eachother. This is where I think my lack of foundational network knowledge is hurting me...\n Even though I have 3 different VLANs configured on the switch, do I also need to create 3 different DHCP scopes to truly separate the various VLAN traffic from each other and the rest of the 10.10.8.1/22 network? If so, how do I tell the relevant VLAN traffic to be assigned to these new particular DHCP scopes? Is that done through more configuration in the HP switch, itself? I am trying to determine if I setup VLAN incorrectly and it's not behaving how it should, or it's setup correctly and my understanding isn't correct.\n I hope this makes sense.

The core network is running MPLS but they want to move the connections to the newer ASR9900 routers while they convince customers to move to ethernet and they no longer want to introduce legacy circuit types into the 9900 routers (not sure if there's any module that still supports it there) The interfaces consists of L3VPN and L2VPN doing interworking. Are there any suggestions here on what device we can possibly put in to migrate those legacy circuits into a separate box so that we just connect that box into the ASR9900 as ethernet?

The role is based on Fortinet SD-WAN/Firewalls, Ubiquiti WiFI/Switching. Company consists of a large number of sites, though the sites are small in size, so Ubiquiti makes sense for their business requirements. \n Something that is making me hesitant, is the fact that this company is using Ubiquiti WiFi/Switching & doesn't sound like there is much of a solid plan to move away from this to an enterprise solution. The cash for this role is more than what I am currently on, but I am a little concerned that by taking the role, my skills with enterprise equipment will squander, and it will be hard to move into a more enterprise role in the future. \n I use Ubiquiti equipment at home, and it is fine, but not sure I'd use it an enterprise setting. \n TLDR: If I take a role working on Ubiquiti equipment, will this tarnish my resume/skillset? \n Luppa\n    submitted by    /u/lupriana  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi r/networking!\n I'm a junior sysadmin/hobbyist working on a script and ansible suite for managing an automated lab infrastructure in a VMWare environment and am now looking for some input on E-W traffic design! (Preliminary note: As of current design, for any edge router 1-8 internal firewall 'zones' can be implemented and any one internal firewall 'zone' can be a mirrored DMZ of an internal zone. Any firewall in turn can manage 8 different portgroups connected to an arbitrary amount of hosts. All backdoor management is through an isolated private vlan.)\n In the first image I've connected the edge router to two portgroups, one for internal traffic and one for dmz traffic. Any firewall-router belonging to one of these two categories would be connected to one of these two portgroupps. https://snipboard.io/oSHWN5.jpg\n In the second image all firewall-routers have been isolated to their own portgroup, connected in turn to the edge-router. https://snipboard.io/oIU4r1.jpg\n My question is: What would be best practice with consideration of system internal traffic and separation of duties? Would you want the edge router to route internal east-west traffic if it delegated to different firewalls? Or would you want them on a shared 'uplink' portgroup and subnet and do the east-west traffic by themselves? Spontaneously I'd say that the edge-router should primarily be concerned with North-South and internal traffic is to be managed on the internal firewalls, but then again, I have little to no experience. Would these be easier to manage as well rather than muddying the waters to have the firewalls do *some* firewalling in regards to internal EW traffic and the edge router do *some* of that as well?\n I appreciate any input and thanks for reading. :)\n    submitted by    /u/manpagebob  \n [link]   [comments]",

Aruba uses Airwave, while Cisco relies on DNAC. This disparity in UIs makes it time-consuming for us to navigate and configure both platforms efficiently. \n Lack of Central Management and Monitoring: We're struggling with the absence of a centralized solution for managing and monitoring devices across both platforms. It would be ideal to have a single management system that allows us to seamlessly control and monitor both Cisco and Aruba devices.\n Single NAC Solution: We're in need of a Network Access Control (NAC) solution that is compatible with both Cisco and Aruba devices. This NAC solution should be fully functional and comply with standards such as RADIUS and TACACS+. Specifically, we're looking for features like MAC profiling for dynamic MAC registration, BYOD portals, and guest portals. Additionally, it should support both wired and wireless 802.1x authentication and provide administrative authentication for Aruba and Cisco devices.\n  \nOpen to any suggestions or recommendations that can help us address these challenges. If you have faced similar situations or successfully integrated Cisco and Aruba devices in a mixed deployment, your expertise would be greatly appreciated!\n Please share your experiences, or any solutions you might know of that could help us overcome these issues.

The peer noticed the first one wasn't sending heartbeats, so it tried to acquire the resources and tell the first one to release resources. The first one stayed online, and the result was both were stealing each other's TCP sessions, causing random session resets, until I forcibly rebooted the first LTM VE node.\n This could have been prevented if the TMOS supported either sending a 'power off the peer' command to VCSA, or if the ESXi/LTM-VE combination was capable of having a watchdog configured, where the hypervisor would reset the VM if it failed to receive any watchdog heartbeats after some period of time.\n Are either of these possible?

          "description": "Given a setup like this: snipboard.io/TrJVaH.jpg\n In the first step, let's assume two separate DSL lines going into two separate routers (VyOS machines). Both DSL lines provide public WAN IP via DHCP. VyOS boxes are configured to use NAT. On the inside VRRP is used for router redundancy.\n Now my concern is is NAT and its connection tracking. When a router handover occurs, all the connections will slowly have to time out (I believe). Is this the best that one can do?\n Now here is VRRP connection tracking sync. But I don't see how this would help since both boxes have a different WAN address. So even if all connection tracking is synced, responses from the internet will fail on handover because responses are sent to the old WAN address.\n ​\n The only way how I see this working if the internet somehow sees the same WAN for both routers. How can this work?\n Question 1: Let's assume we have no own IP network but only the two dynamically assigned WAN addresses by the two ISP. Is the sketched setup (without connection-tracking sync) the best that can be done?\n ​\n Question 2: Suppose we do have a /24 that is routed by the two ISPs. Now the public IPs are, say, 192.0.2.100 and 192.168.0.2.101 respectively. How would would one build a redundant router for an internal NAT network with that config? \n The only way I can see this working is assigning the same public IP to the VyOS machine (some sort of \"multicast\") but that's of course not permissible. Or add another box in front of the two VyOS routers that performs NAT. But then there's again a single point of failure and no point in having redundant routers behind it.\n    submitted by    /u/segdy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Okay, so I was always the guy who told everybody that SA Lifetimes should match on both sides of IPSec tunnel.\n That was until last week when I was troubleshooting periodic downtimes on a tunnel that I just moved from ASA to our new Palo Alto. Remote side is a Virtual Private Gateway in our contractor's AWS VPC.\n They were occuring at random times when rekeying Phase 2 SA.\n Sometimes the tunnel was up for two days and then suddenly dropped. Sometimes it dropped after just 3 hours. (Phase 1 - 8 Hours, Phase 2 - 1 Hour)\n The worst thing was that only Phase 2 SA went down and the AWS endpoint wasn't able to deal with that so it always meant that nothing could pass through the tunnel until the IKE SA expired or until I cleared the SAs manually.\n Finally I got some time to troubleshoot and enabled debugs on PA. I also requested logs from the guy operating the AWS infrastructure (not a networking guy).\n After I had a look at these logs, I figured out that sometimes it would occur that we started rekeying the Phase 2 SA at the same time which eventually caused the new and the old SA to get deleted on PA.\n I ended up changing the P2 SA Lifetime so it's longer than configured lifetime on the other side and I have no problems since because only one side initiates the rekey now...\n Never stop learning...\n    submitted by    /u/PatrikPiss  \n [link]   [comments]",

Power cycle did not work. I had the same IP address in both configs but ended up using the reset button after the power was back. It did the same thing when trying to update the SwOS firmware. ???\n I have a simple setup with a few workstations and a laptop. They have very fast SSDs that can copy to each other in the same workstation at around 4-5GBs and to themselves at around 1-2GBs.\n I used the /int bridge port print command and all the ports have HW hardware on.\n __________________________________\n I've looked at it a bit more and with workstation1, workstation2 and the laptop all on the same CRS305 switch. Both WS1 and the Laptop get 1.00-1.02GBs and the Windows file copy graph looks flat with only very small dips. Looks really good. But if I copy from the WS1 to the Laptop or the Laptop to WS1 I get around 400-500MBs and it's all over the place.\n WS1 and the Laptop are using Ethernet ports and Ethernet SFP modules on the CRS305 switch. WS2 has Fiber SFP modules. Not sure if that matters.\n ​\n Here is a video copying first on the laptop in the RDP window from WS2, then on WS1 from WS2.\n Then from WS1 to the Laptop and then from the laptop to WS1. The last one, laptop to WS1 is always the slowest to start, it goes up slowly.\n I just don't get how/why copying from WS2 is rock solid on both but then between WS1 and the laptop is so bad.\n All three PCs have SSDs that can read and write over 3GBs.\n File Copy Video\n    submitted by    /u/Tanquen256  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, I am looking to set up a SOHO network supporting 10GoE, which will have around 6 workstations, two NASs with dual bonded nics, printers, a WAP, and a few other network connected devices. There are times of heavy data transfers of 1TB or more and regular transfers of ~50GB+.\n I’m thinking a minimum 24-port switch, which will allow for future expansion. I’m looking for suggestions on a switch, that will probably need to be managed for possible future VLAN setup. Please let me know what you’d implement and what you’d avoid. While I will likely have the support of the IT department, this will likely be managed locally by me, with some networking (and learning more rapidly) knowledge.

          "description": "Hello,\n I recently took over a new network and we have been asked to reduce cost across the board including our SDWAN. Currently we use an MSP with Velocloud devices. We pay ~$1000/month on average per branch for the Velocloud managed-service. Most of our branches are very small ~5 users, leveraging Velocloud Edge510. We have ~20 sites.\n I have a couple of questions:\n  \nCan Velocloud devices be customer-managed? (wondering if we can save by removing managed services)\n Does anyone have good experience with any other lower cost \"branch router\" options that have simplified/central management? It doesn't have to be SDWAN necessarily but if it is SDWAN, we are looking for an SDWAN that can be customer-managed so that the cost is lower.\n  \nThanks.\n Edit:\n  \nJust found the $1000/month average was skewed by mid/large sites. My apologies for the confusion!\n The correct average cost for small sites with Velocloud Edge510 (with 30Mbps throughput) is around ~$200/month per site, this includes hardware device(s), license and managed-service (it's a bit lower for sites with a single VCE router and higher for sites with dual VCE routers).\n Based on the comments this appears to be a more reasonable cost for the small sites though it's still good to see what others are using or recommending for lower cost alternatives.

The ISE is not used as a CA, it's a client/endpoint with its own system certificate, only. It is just a node with its own publically signed SSL cert. Yet, you can litreally only choose a certificate from the trusted source certificate page, which is a page dedicated for Root/Intermediary CA certificates. So the config doesnt make sense. It's like the ISE is saying to the syslog server, Hi syslog server I am some upchain CA server, we good?\n If you read the Cisco ISE documentation in the link below, under the section heading \"Configure Secure Syslog Remote Logging Target\", it states, step 12:\n \"Choose the CA certificate that Cisco ISE must present to the secure syslog server from the Select CA Certificate drop-down list.\"\n https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-1/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_3_1/b_ISE_admin_31_basic_setup.html\n So you are forced to present a CA certificate, even though we don't use the ISE as a CA server.

          "description": "I work at a university and we have an newer outdoor athletics facility that has fiber ran to each corner of the facility. The boxes are built into the ground so that they're inconspicuous. The issue is that each winter they fill up with water, it ruins the GFI switches to the power inside and the fiber that comes into a second smaller box located inside still gets filled with water and gets dirty. They were barely able to host the event this year due to this issue but it's been a recurring problem for the 3 years the facility has been built. \n So my understanding of the setup is: fiber from a pressbox to a subterranean enclosure, fiber goes into that box into a smaller grey box that does something I don't understand, we then bring a switch that we keep inside a pelican case over and plug the fiber from the small grey box inside the subterranean enclosure into the switch, then all the necessary devices plug into the switch using ethernet. The water is getting into the small grey box and breaking things each winter.\n I don't know enough about networking to hold an eduacated converstation on the topic with you all but I just got out of a meeting with some people that presented me with a solution to this issue that I didn't like. They admitted they don't know how other places do it so we're all kinda hunting for solutions to this issue. They want something above ground but since it's an athletics facility that would require a box right on the edge of a playing field which presents competitive, asthetic and safety concerns. \n Is there a box or setup of some kind that can be left in an underground enclosure that would be able to stay dry for a number of years? I asked if there wasn't a way to cap the fiber cable coming into the subterranean enclosure with a cap that was waterproof then just bring the boxes and switches for the events each time but they said there's no cap that would keep it clean enough. \n Any thoughts or solutions would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/jmankyll  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I am trying to understand the need to have both on our network. \n Currently finishing up a network upgrade that included a lot of new things, but some of the main things were adding Cisco ISE for radius and tacacs. Another part is adding wireless to our network for the first time. Wireless is all Aruba and we are using clearpass to authorize wireless clients. APs are all Aruba, and also using AIRwave.\n So basically two AAA servers. One for wireless and one for wired. \n From my understanding, you can do wireless authentication with ISE though. ISE can authorize your wired and wireless clients, all on one device. \n Is it really necessary to have both aruba clearpass and Cisco ISE on the network? I asked my boss why have both, and his response was so we don’t have to manually enter client mac addresses, I guess they populate when the person connects to the Wi-Fi and then we can place them into the right vlan. But in my experience, ISE does the same thing with wired clients. They get placed into a dead group not associated with a vlan, and then we can assign them to a group. But usually we have them assigned before they connect. \n My issue with having two devices for aaa is having to manually enter macs in two different devices. We are a building that hosts a lot of short term guest with lots of BYOD devices. So we are always receiving lists of MAC addresses that get approved and need added into ISE. It can be a pain especially when getting calls because of connection issues then finding out it’s because someone can’t tell the difference between their wireless mac and wired Mac, plus typos and other errors. I just feel it’s unnecessary to have two devices if it can be handled by one. So just wondering if there is a bigger reason why clearpass and ISE are needed that I may be missing?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/GC_J  \n [link]   [comments]",

To my knowledge there are two ways I can go about this, see below.\n ​\n Option 1. Create the GRE tunnels and create static routes with a higher routing priority & distance which would result in the route not being active in the routing table of the Fortigate. Then create policy routes to perform the actual routing. My manager prefers to stay away from policy routes.\n Option 2. Create the GRE tunnels and create static routes with the same distance & priority. The new route will populate in the active routing table, then create firewall policies around that static route. Please see my concerns below.\n If my Fortigate firewall has a simple LAN > WAN firewall policy and the policy only includes the LAN and WAN1 interfaces and NOT the GRE tunnel inteface. If I add another 0.0.0.0/0 static route (GRE Tunnel) to my routing table with the same distance and priority. Does the Firewall start performing ECMP even though the destination interface is not included with the LAN > WAN policy?

I think it's something like this:\n Transit ISP ---> Datacenter ---> Wholesale Broadband MPLS Net ---> BRAS ---> DSLAM ---> CPE\n How does IP addressing work in a small tier 2 ISP such as this? Now this may be because of my lack of subnetting knowledge but I'm under the impression that each router interface will have a unique subnet.\n Therefore, would the subnetting look like this assuming there is no hardware redundancy (for simplicity of this example)?\n  \n Transit ---> Aggregation Switch A (/30) \n  \n Aggregation Switch ---> Core Router B (/30) \n  Core Router ---> Wholesale Ethernet MPLS C (/30) \n  Customers D (/24) Some form of NAT \n \n If anyone has a detailed diagram of an ISP that utilizes wholesale broadband MPLS I'd greatly appreciate it. Are customers generally assigned private IP addresses and then NAT is used or how does this work?\n Appreciate any advice or pointers towards resources.

No amount of troubleshooting can bring them back up working so.. we do reboot that \"fixes\" things.\n One time, second time, and today - for the third time. 50 developers can't work and ask why, what's the issue? We bought industry leading firewalls, why? \n We ran there, downloaded the logs from the devices and opened a ticket with the vendor. The answer was, for the lack of better word - shocking: \n 1) Current Firewall version XXX, we recommend to upgrade device to latest version YYY (one minor version up)\n 2) Uptime 59-60 days is really high, we recommend to reboot firewall once in 40-45 days (with a maintenance window)\n 3) TMP storage was 96% full, this happens due to long uptime of appliance\n ​\n The last time I felt this way was when some of the rookies went over to replace a switch and turned off the AC in the server room because they had no hoodies, and forgot to turn them on.

At the moment, and for the foreseeable future, the only active equipment at these sites will be a single Wi-Fi access point. Currently at each location, the BiDi fiber is terminated in an SPF in an 8-port Cisco switch. The AP is then uplinked to and is powered by the switch. \n These switches are well past their expected life and I will be replacing them before they start failing. \n Since we don’t need all of the extra switch ports, I have been looking for a media converter that has an SFP cage as well as that can provide PoE out on its copper port (for the AP). These have been impossible to locate thus far.\n Does this device exist?\n I know I can get a low port count switch with PoE out and an SFP cage from Mikrotik and likely others, and I’ll likely go down that road if needed. I was hoping to avoid the extra configuration with those, though.\n Thanks for any pointers!\n    submitted by    /u/anderiv  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I work in k12 and I've got this project that I'm working to implement over the summer and I was wanting some advice from those who are more network savvy than I am since I'm still pretty junior in this role.\n I've got 5 campuses all with their own NVRs on-prem to support their respective IP cameras. Each campus is connected to our main MDF/Server room via 10Gb Fiber connections in a Hub/Spoke topology. The idea here is to get rid of the old NVRs (they suck and require Edge in IE mode to even use) and move everything to a single server in our server room.\n The campuses all have the cameras on their own subnets but while some campuses have a completely isolated set of switches that only connect to cameras and the NVR, some of the older campuses don't have isolated switches and simply rely on VLANs.\n So basically this is what I have: 5 Campuses with their own subnets, some with dedicated switches, others with dedicated VLANs (Security).\n  \n172.16.50.0/24\n 172.17.50.0/24\n 172.18.50.0/24\n 172.19.50.0/24\n 172.20.50.0/24\n  \nI need to remove the NVRs and get them talking to a server located at 10.0.9.75.\n Now what I would *think* I need to do, is simply make sure all physical ports that cameras are located on are simply Untagged with the security VLAN, and make sure all successive uplinks between switches all the way back to the core switch (which the server will be connected to) are Tagged with the security VLAN.\n One of my big concerns is whether or not I need to implement any kind of Layer 3 routing (beyond what we already have) with this setup. I don't believe I do, but I would like advice on this if at all possible. \n Please let me know if it seems like I've left something out or if I can answer any questions that might help better explain.

They have logs from their Cisco FTD about failed anti-replay checking. I don't really want to get into the specifics on this, since I think the out of order packets is a red herring, but it did get me thinking about what is \"normal\" in these circumstances over the internet.\n I took some packet captures from our router at their branch site. I can see all tunnel packets being forwarded in perfect order ip.id 11, 12, 13, 14 etc. On the remote peer of this tunnel, I can see these tunnel packets arriving ever so slightly out of order intermittently, by about 1-3 packets. So for example, 23, 24, 26, 25 .... then 62, 63, 66, 64, 65. Again, a very low number of packets are actually out of order, something like a few hundred packets out of a capture file that is 100k packets in size. I am using the IPv4 Identification field to count and identify the packets, as our tunnel is a single stream, so I believe this should be valid.\n TLDR; As a UDP flow crosses the internet, is it normal for their to a very, very small amount of re-ordering? There is a lot of different physical media used by providers, carriers to provide transport and connectivity. Also, there LAG's and different speed links, then QoS and queuing....

          "description": "Hello,\n I’m going to keep my question brief and give as much of an overview as necessary so that you wonderfully smart people can guide me in the direction by way of articles, advice, tips or tricks.\n I am in a pickle. We currently use a vendor who provides us with a service which is awfully useful to us. Without going into incredible detail for the sake of brevity, this service provides us the ability to present our remote cellular routers as existing within the same vnet and from here, we can monitor them with SNMP.\n The reason we do this is because we need to reboot these routers each day, the routers may also be rebooted without warning or reason - and because they are cellular routers, each time they reboot they obtain a new public IP. \n This, therefore, makes it rather hard to simply probe their WAN interfaces. \n Anyway, what I need to do is find away to effectively recreate this service as our vendor is doing away with it - gee thanks! \n I am looking at using an NVA inside of azure - I’m not bothered by the vendor right now, I just need a POC - this NVA will be the VPN headend for our remote routers and I am hoping to present to them a subnet from which we will deploy our sensors to to provide remote monitoring.\n At the moment, I am using a Sonicwall NSv - but I fear I’ve vastly over simplified matters. The testing of my IPsec VPN policy between a remote site and the NVA shows packets coming and going on ports 500, but the ports on 4500 are being dropped somewhere.\n Now this isn’t a tshooting question (I’ve got other posts for that - and yes I’ve enabled NAT-T, IP forwarded on the azure interface, etc etc) \n What this post is asking is, am I looking at the solution correctly? Is a site to cloud solution the best thing to do? We do not have the ability to use on prem equipment - we don’t have our own core network! - so our needs are pretty much all cloud based.\n Anyway long post over - thank you\n    submitted by    /u/Thy_OSRS  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the past few years I have done two installs in which both required about 10-20 accesspoints and at that time I went with unifi and till this day everything is working great. So for my next scheduled install I was going to bite the bullet on unifi again but thought i would get some insight on some other brands/products. I did some searching around and seems like for my price range Unifi vs Engenius Fit vs Aruba Instant On is all kinda in the same price range so I guess I am looking to compare that.\n Truth be told, my budget is max the cost of a unifi install, I could slightly raise it if need to but don't want to surprass the budget of what a unifi install would cost me.\n Right now for this install I am planning around 30 accesspoints, probably need 1 x 16 port switch + 2 x 8 switches or maybe 4 x 8 port switches + whatever else i need to be able to run captive portal/splashpage and will run whatever router i can find that they provide or is recommended.\n maybe i am old school but tbh uap ac pro have been good enough for me (i really doubt people need more speed) but i guess maybe it is time to make the switch to wifi 6, maybe it will have better range?\n i did some brief searching and my potential unifi build was something like this\n 6 x 5 packs of the uap ac pro/nano hd (will buy whatever i can find in 5 pack?)\n udm dream machine or udm pro\n unifi poe switches\n i don't think i want to pass a budget of 8000$ cad tbh (this is what a unifi with nano hd 5 pack would hit)\n i know if i went with engenius i would be able to comfortably fit wifi 6 under my budget but not sure if the product is superior. also for aruba instant on seem like they are pricey as well and prob similar to unifi in price range but not sure if they are better etc\n thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/rpelich  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're only 8 months into it so offering to renew the contract doesn't get them excited. What other levers are there to get an ISP to up your throughput at the same or lower price? What else could we offer that they care about?\n Long version: We have two fiber circuits through Spectrum - 1g directly from them and a 100m carrier diverse circuit managed by Spectrum but actually provided by some combination of GTT and Frontier. We reach 90% of our capacity up and down at least once a day so I'd like to get that second connection up to 1g to A) provide more headroom and B) have a viable secondary circuit. If a backhoe finds our sole 1g line, we'd be in for a lot of hurt trying to run the business on the 100m alone.\n But we're only 8 months into our contract. I'd hoped to get better service at a lower price by renewing (I'd originally been led to believe we were half way through our contract) but they're not interested. Is there anything else I can offer them to sweeten the deal in their eyes? All they're offering right now is to increase our throughput on the secondary line with a corresponding cost increase. \n They're also posturing that they resell price they've received from GTT/Frontier is something they have no control over even though the number Spectrum gave me for a 1g Frontier connection is 30% higher than what Frontier quoted me directly.\n    submitted by    /u/cmrcmk  \n [link]   [comments]",

The majority of data transfers will be directed towards the internet, while a smaller portion will be allocated for local traffic, such as printing tasks and access to a limited number of local resources on the file server, if necessary.\n The proposed video surveillance system will comprise 55 PoE cameras, with each camera potentially requiring up to 10 Mb/s bandwidth to the local recording server (total of 550 Mb/s) and monitoring workstation. As we consider the impact on the LAN, we would appreciate any insights or experiences you can share.\n Switches are planned to be stacked and interconnected in a dozen racks connected to the MDF through 10 Gb/s fiber links.\n I am enclosing a rough rack ports count, which includes a full option (all wall ports connected to switches) and a minimum option (all cables connected to patch panels, but only required ports effectively connected to switches, to lower initial number of required switches).\n https://i.ibb.co/kgKRzzH/Screenshot-6.png\n We are curious about determining if dedicated appliances are necessary to effectively manage the network load. Your expertise and suggestions are highly valued. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/_ReeX_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Upon investigation, I found a bunch of MAC addresses that didn’t register to a vendor. I checked the firewall and each address had traffic indicative of an Apple device. (Apple Maps, ICloud, FB, etc). \n There were roughly 26 different MAC addresses with similar traffic, each reserving a different IP via DHCP. I then checked the wireless controller, and found only 1 iPhone was actively connected. This was during normal working hours. \n Did this 1 iPhone reserve 26 different IPs? Apple mentions the MAC address changes daily when “Private Wi-Fi Address” is enabled, does it also change when hopping from one access point to another under the same SSID? Did this individual leave a trail of DHCP reservations everywhere he walked in the facility, hopping from AP to AP? \n Has anybody else dealt with this?\n    submitted by    /u/RoughOpportunity65  \n [link]   [comments]",

We cannot reach this building with a microwave or fiber, so we purchased a leased line and created an IPsec VPN tunnel from Building A to Remote Building (Building B).\n The end goal of this project is to have Building B fully connected to our network, able to access wireless, fileshares, voip, etc.\n Typically, when we deploy a new building, we simply extend vlans to the building over fiber or microwave. Basically create the Vlan/IRB on the core, and trunk it to where it needs to go. \n There are a few problems here, one of them being I have no control or say over what is configured on the firewall, and the person who deploys our firewall is old, stubborn, and very hard to work with. That being said, his VPN Tunnel works just not how I need it to.\n Here's the other problem: His tunnel provides us with a single LAN. Say 10.10.10.1/24 . We are only able to configure a single VLAN based off this, and the remote location needs roughly 10 VLANs. I have asked him to join me in a call with Cisco to see if we can figure out a solution and he says he doesn't have time. \n So yes I know you cannot help me in dealing with this difficult Person , but I was hoping someone could lend some best practice, tips, or advice. I have a strong feeling there must be a simpler way of extending a network, however my experience is limited.\n If you need any clarity on anything, feel free to ask.

Or is there a required minimum input \n 4) Also do these devices require the plugs they use to be grounded for them to work or is a hot and neutral good enough? \n https://www.mercadolibre.com.mx/regulador-de-voltaje-koblenz-rs-1410-1410va-entrada-y-salida-de-120v-negro/p/MLM17328307\n This is the regulator i want to buy, i returned it because it wasn’t working and then realized after it could have been because the voltage was so low or because the plug wasn’t grounded. I hope the link helps with the questions sorry it’s in Spanish.\n Hope someone can help i’m not getting that far with google 👍\n    submitted by    /u/fewfewping  \n [link]   [comments]",

By creating separate VLANs for different types of traffic, network administrators can apply different security policies to each VLAN to restrict access to sensitive resources and prevent lateral movement between VLANs.\n GPOs: Group Policy Objects can be used to enforce security policies on Windows endpoints. GPOs can be used to restrict access to specific applications, block USB devices, disable unnecessary services, and enable advanced security features such as Windows Defender Firewall and BitLocker.\n Application executions whitelisting: Application executions whitelisting is a security practice that allows only trusted applications to run on a system, while blocking all other applications. This can be done by creating a whitelist of approved applications and preventing any other applications from running. This can help to prevent the execution of malicious software and limit the attack surface of the system.\n Adopting this strategy, one could achieve the same effect as using an NGFW license, but with a more targeted tool for the education world at the same cost.\n Your thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/_ReeX_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Initially our Palo Alto FW was discarding packets because of multiple subsequent SYN packets on the same port coming in & the FW was logging it as \"TCP-REUSE\" . We applied a zone protection profile to help mitigate that discard/reject behavior but there are still I/O erros in the Application logs and I'm still seeing some aged-out sessions. I don't believe it has to do with the way the firewall is configured and when we applied a custom application with a higher timeout value it made things worse..no asymm routing either as there are tcp-fins.95 percent success rate but still errors\n    submitted by    /u/ITNerdWhoGolfs  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I don't have too much knowledge on network)\n The network diagram is here: https://pastebin.com/iENaTizD \n Text diagram:\n  \nI have one RB5009 router (one SFP+ connected to the switch; one 2.5G connected to 2.5G AP; one 1G connected to 1G AP; one 1G connected to a 1G interface openspeedtest machine)\n One CRS309 switch. (all SFP+)\n 2.5G AP (unifi, can go with 2400Mbps Phy speed, 2.5G interface is connected to the router)\n 1G AP (unifi, can go with 876Mbps Phy speed, 1G interface is connected to the router)\n Dell server(10G SFP nic, connected to switch, running openspeedtest, pretty sure the openspeedtest server itself can go beyond 5G/5G at least)\n PC (1G nic, connected to router, running openspeedtest.)\n  \nThe problem:\n Devices connecting to those APs (either 2.5G or 1G) will have full upload speed. But their download speed is always half of the upload. I feel that they might have some issues because of mixed interface speeds on the route. If I run speedtest on the 1G PC server, everything is fine.\n In short:\n 10G openspeedtest <-> 2.5G/1G AP (half download, correct upload). 1G openspeedtest <-> 2.5G/1G AP (correct download and upload). 10 G openspeedtest <-> 1G PC (correct download and upload) \n Does anyone know how to solve this issue? Or any ideas on how to debug this? From the results, does that mean the problem exits on those APs? (since the 1G PC can test correctly to 10G openspeedtest)\n Things I have done:\n  \nI turned on/off all tx/rx flow control. (including flow control settings in unifi controller) They didn't help.\n I heard someone mentioned Mikrotik devices have small buffer. And they said there is no solution to 10G>1G cases. (but why my 1G PC doesn't have this issue when testing with 10G server?)\n I have a SFP+toRJ45 on the way.

Now the real problem is, We have multiple work places. Both ISP runs perfectly at local station. If ISP-A is up and which is connected to C-Name, then issues for other station client or work from home clients. If ISP-A is down and ISP-B is running(which is not connected to C-name), other station clients or work from home clients unable to open to subdomain or run program, Hence we need to change the CNAME to ISP-B to run locally and other stations.\n We have ubuntu server.

Network guys want me to continue using OSPF (vs BGP). I'm a sysadmin, and only a routing noob. \n I've largely moved our quagga configurations over to frr test systems. However, I noticed that setting OSPF costs for interfaces (lo loopback) seemed to have no effect. In the quagga config (same lo loopback architecture), changing OSPF cost affects routes (as it should). In the frr config, it does not. The router guys can see the cost changes on their route updates when I change quagga configs. They see no route cost changes when I change the frr config. In fact, they have a cost of 0 for ours no matter what I set ours to (10 total, technically, but that includes their default cost for the hop).\n I would expect my configured cost to be picked up by my neighbor, but it is not (for frr). I assume this is a bug, but maybe it's different functionality of frr from quagga regarding loopback?

          "description": "I overheard a network engineer vendor we work with describe a proposed topology I didn't quite understand. Two distinct networks each with their own respective VLANs would be connected by L3 switches across an MPLS link using only SVIs, so something like a /30 only between the edge switches like so is what I'm presuming. I tried to do this in PacketTracer but couldn't get it to work, so I assume I'm missing something:\n interface GigabitEthernet0/1 description SITE2_EDGE_SW-SITE1_EDGE_SW switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 100 ! interface Vlan100 description SITE2_EDGE_SW ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.252 ! interface Vlan10 description PC_VLAN ip address 10.0.10.0 255.255.255.0 \n Is it possible to simply route traffic from SITE2 that is destined for VLANS at SITE1 across an SVI like this? Normally I would have done this using a non switchport physical interface that I assigned a /30 ip address to Gi0/1 instead of doing it across L2 trunk, but I could easily be missing something obvious. \n Is it possible to route traffic from, say, the PC_VLAN in SITE2 on 10.0.10.0 out through Gi0/1 to a SITE1 VLAN on a different subnet like 10.0.100.0 using a L2 trunk?\n    submitted by    /u/72dragonses  \n [link]   [comments]",

They will never install ACs in every room (and they change the configuration of the rooms almost every time I come back, it’s a Zimbabwean thing).\n So, the internet gets so bad that we can’t even load websites, and while I know they could be doing stuff to help, they’re thinking simply upping from 25 to like 40mbps would do the trick.

          "description": "I am working on a project that uses a spool of ethernet cable on a modified hose reel which can be wound in and out. One end is connected to a device which reads gas composition and dropped down a hole about 100 feet. The other end is plugged into my laptop where I can view live readings. This connection must be made and the device turned on manually at the surface, before it is dropped, so I cannot unplug the connection to the laptop at any time. \n The problem I have is that while the cable is being unwound and the device lowered down the hole, the cable end going to my laptop is simultaneously spinning/twisting up. If it drops 100 feet, there's suddenly 70 or so windings in my 6 ft of ethernet cable between the laptop and the spool of cable. \n Can you think of any solution to this? I essentially hand wind/spin the cable in the opposite direction 50 times or so every time I connect to the spool so it minimizes the problem but I am looking for an elegant solution. Perhaps some kind of preload spring/spool that keeps it wound in the opposite direction or a special highly-rotatable cable or something. Any ideas would be appreciated! \n Also, any ideas for a powered winch which holds 200 ft of cat7? I've been looking at anchor winches but they only seem to hold 100 ft of .20 rope.

Once you move the VM to another host, new network route will involve different equipment which is unaware of the preexisting connections.\n How is it achieved that existing TCP connections to the VM are preserved without an interruption? Are there scholarly articles that explore approaches of proprietary vendors such as vMotion in detail?\n    submitted by    /u/Kentzo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I remember learning that this was a big no no when I was in school, but that cable was installed 3-4 years ago prior to me working here and has remained connected ever since without any noticeable problems (from my perspective, at least), so what exactly are the concerns associated with this improper mating? For reference, the demarc has the APC connector (female) to which our ISP's NID connects via a SC/UPC-terminated simplex fiber cable.\n The main reason for my asking is because I'm about to send a strongly worded email to our ISP telling them to get out here and fix it, but since I've never dealt with this before I don't know what expectations I should have as a customer. Do they need to polish the demarc's connector before they install the new cable, or should it be re-terminated? Do they need to bring an OTDR out and re-certify the connection?

We used single mode fiber all the way through and installed a second line as a secondary. This was pre existing fiber infrastructure, I just patched things into the adjacent dark fiber patch panels to get from point A to point B. The second building is a new building and the patch panels are new. \n I’m not very well versed in fiber and such but I did do a ping test from switch to switch and got under 1ms responses which I thought was all good. Now Network team conducted a TX/RX optical power test from the switches and found that we’re losing about -10db on the run on both lines and both ways. So right now our RX on both switches is around -13 to -16 db. So my question is, is this normal or is something seriously wrong and what is most likely the cause?

I am looking to see if a proposed network design is possible.\n We currently have a network that is double-nat'd as that is what the customer is providing us. Our network is communicating via cellular to a separate building to view all required devices. We are looking to bring all devices over to one network, however, there seems to be stability issues and due to the nature of the customer, want to keep the networks separated.\n The caveat is that both networks are programmed with the same subnet, so adding a third router will not work. (I know I know)\n As a temporary solution (Again I know), I want to propose the design below to see if it is feasible. It would effectively require the addition of two new routers to a tripple nat'd design. The requirement is that router 1 be able to talk to the devices behind router 2.

Link at the bottom for abstracted architecture.\n We have two ISPs and two firewalls in different buildings.\n The ISP Routers are connected to a switch, whose only purpose is to connect both Firewalls (Fortigate) to the ISP router in case of firewall failure.\n Outgoing traffic gets replies that are properly handled by the firewall (doesn't seem to be a L1-L3 problem on the side of the ISP).\n Incoming traffic however does not get handled properly - Pings from WAN to the interface do not receive a reply, Port forwarding does not work either. On the other interface the configuration is the same but it works.\n When pinging the WAN interface of the firewall in ISP1s network (1.1.1.2), there is no reply.\n When pinging the WAN interface of the firewall in ISP2s network (2.2.2.1), there is a reply.\n When capturing network traffic on switch 1 (traffic on the interfaces that are connected to the firewalls, both directions) i can see that the ping request gets sent to the active firewall. There is no reply though.\n When i plug a laptop into the switch 1 and give it the IP address of the router (1.1.1.1, no further addresses available sadly) i get a reply to the ping.\n The firewalls are fortigates, they are configured as active/active but from what i've gathered only the primary firewall handles traffic, the secondary firewall gets used to offload security processing.\n https://imgur.com/a/TDSU8xW\n ​\n Any ideas what i could look into further?\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/PerceptionSmooth8959  \n [link]   [comments]",
