PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and allied networks as well as software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive networks.\nThis joint CSA builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal and state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government; critical infrastructure, including the Def…",

During incident response activities, CISA uncovered that likely multiple APT groups compromised the organization’s network, and some APT actors had long-term access to the environment. APT actors used an open-source toolkit called Impacket to gain their foothold within the environment and further compromise the network, and also used a custom data exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to steal the victim’s sensitive data.\nThis joint Cyb…",

These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber actors’ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.\nOT/ICS devices and designs are publicly available, often inco…",

          "description": "Let's put aside the fact that throughout the years whenever I faced a problem with CPU usage/high clock I usually faced a 95+ System idle. I faced similar situations on Linux with 100% of the cases ending in htop (linux command) showing me the exact culprit. If not by CPU usage then by CPU wakes.\n Recently my opinion solidified when facing the highest CPU usage I've ever seen on Windows 10 on my laptop. This time I knew the culprit upfront (broken windows search, confirmed by windows reliability history error messages). Windows Search constantly banged the CPU and failed to start, CPU die constantly at 65 deg C. As soon as I fixed Windos Search the CPU die temperature dropped to ~40 deg C! The thing is the entire time neither of the built-in Windows Tools (including the Sysinternals Process Explorer) showed any useful information on the issue. No listed component spiked to more than 3-5% of CPU. Even the memory usage tab in Resource Monitor was better at hinting the culprit than the releavant CPU sections!\n What are your thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/rimbooreddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Company is standing up a new enterprise application that is going to be the backbone of the organization. Needs to be extremely highly available and fully support blue/green deployments. The application has a content storage component that just needs to point to an NFS share. Making that NFS share highly available / fully redundant is an exercise left to the implementer, and I'm waffling a bit on deciding what makes sense.\n Solution needs to be fully replicated, clustered, and highly available (instant failover either during outage or during deployments). We also need to be able to support our DR process which currently is replicating on prem VMware VMs to Azure.\n We were going to go with GlusterFS, but just found out that Redhat has killed that product and we definitely want enterprise support for whatever solution we choose.

Due to compliance, I have to prevent them from being able to talk to other devices on the network (such as home PCs, IoT devices, etc...).\n We use ESET Endpoint Antivirus and RocketCyber SIEM/SOC software. Both of those applications have an isolation mode that prevents that PC from talking to anything other than the ESET/RocketCyber console.\n Is there anyway to achieve this type of protection using only software, but still allow WAN/Internet access (so basically it can talk to the gateway and nothing else). The isolation modes in the applications I mention, prevent general WAN/Internet access as well... so they won't work in this situation.\n However, since they are able to lock it down to a specific port/application... I assume there must be some way to do what I am describing. I searched around looking for Windows Firewall rules, but those seem to be limited to very specific protocols/ports. I would like true isolation like Wireless access points do in Guest mode.\n Since this is in multiple home networks, I don't really have the option to create network segmentation (VLANs, etc...).\n Any help is greatly appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/g2tegsown  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, this is something new to me...\n We have a customer who's got 30-40 users within a latency of circa 5-10ms to the remote desktop session host. However, they've just had 4 outsourced users added from India (we're in the UK). Each Indian user is around 150-200ms.\n When we have 40 UK-based users concurrently online, the server CPU can sit roughly at 60%. However, if you swap a couple of UK users for Indians, the server CPU will spike and sometimes sit at 90% with spikes to 100% and the associated freezes you get when out of resource.\n Strangely, this manifests itself in a Windows Explorer process taking between 10-20% CPU for each user. However, if you right-click the Windows Explorer process and choose to restart it, the user sees a brief flash on their session as the explorer is reset, and CPU usage dips back to the circa 0% that it normally uses for other users. It quickly returns to the 10-20% range though.\n I was just wondering whether anyone has noticed the correlation between client latency and server CPU usage?\n    submitted by    /u/pentangleit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I had a call yesterday with AT&T, during which they were trying to sell me on their \"new\" Switched Ethernet solution to replace our DIA fiber. (We have multiple locations - most of which have 50mb fiber as the primary connection and some flavor of cable or non-dedicated fiber as the backup.) The proposal looked promising and would save us around $200/mo per location. There would be no managed router, and supposedly I would get an online portal where I can throttle speed in real time. Not a huge need, but an interesting proposition, none the less. Of course, the ATT rep couldn't/wouldn't give me any other 'cons' that might be an issue and even said they could get us out of our current contracts and give us the same or better SLAs that we have now.\n So, I come to you, good people of Reddit. Who has experience with this ASEoD product, can offer insight as it compares to DIA fiber, or any other advice along these lines. Have you used this portal they speak of? Is it awesome or meh? Pros? Cons? TIA\n    submitted by    /u/geo972  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a really good business move for all involved. We're now talking about the collaboration between our IT departments, and they would like to migrate into their 365 tenant, which they have done for all of their previous acquisitions.\n I don't inherently have an issue with this, but we are considerably larger than their previous acquisitions, and utilise O365 a lot more than these smaller companies (and it sounds like we utilize more than the new parent does with regards to Azure and Intune/Autopilot, etc.).\n I did a very brief stint at an MSP before working here, and there we used some kind of Partner Portal to look after all of our 365 tenants. Is this something that the parent company can do and onboard our tenant as a whole, separate entity? I thought this was the case, but the more I look at it, the more it looks like the Partner Centre scheme is something for resellers (which the parent isn't, but the aim is for them to provide licences to us, along with collaboration on projects, so there might be some overlap there).\n Am I barking up the wrong tree here and have the wrong idea about the Partner Centre?

          "description": "Ridiculous task of the week, we've been tasked with securing access to Office 365 for someone using a personal MacBook. With Windows 10 of course, we would Azure register the device and use MAM in Intune/Endpoint Manager with Windows Information Protection. And of course on iPads, iPhones, and Android phones, there's app policies available too\n Obviously this is not something we can do with Mac. And as it's a BYOD laptop, we are not at liberty to lock the entire laptop down. Is there any sort of data protection policy or software we can use with Mac, or are we SOL? They're basically just going to be using Office and OneDrive\n Edit: I did find this from MS, which seems to offer some level of support, but as commenters have already stated, it's just a terrible idea and I'm going to strongly make that point\n    submitted by    /u/DeifniteProfessional  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both scenarios upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11 22H2 and upgrade Windows 11 21H2 to 22H2.\n After this bad experience we created a case at the HP Support. After some troubleshooting and sending them our logs we have found the issue.\n It's the Synaptics touchpad driver. \n When we remove the driver the upgrade is working fine.

I have only one certificate with private key stored in Kleopatra, and it's set to my default identity, and \"ultimate\" trusted.\n I've googled for hours, read through documentation, found examples, but a few of the option switches that are widely referenced don't seem to work with gpg4win (IE, --passphrase-file or --passphrase_fl, or even just --passphrase).\n Here's my current syntax for a test encryption\n .\\gpg -r \"KEYNAME\" -o testencrypt.gpg --pinentry-mode=loopback --passphrase \"PASSPHRASE\" --default-recipient-self --always-trust -encrypt test.txt\n yeilds :\n gpg: ypt: skipped: No public keygpg: test.txt: encryption failed: No public key\n I'm not sure if I even need the passphrase for encryption, rather than decryption - but if I omit --passphrase, it prompts for one.\n I haven't gotten to decryption syntax, but figure it will be pretty much just the opposite process.

Hardware team resolves the issues, comments on the ticket saying issue has been resolved, can we proceed to close the ticket, customer comments back about a quey on something that is not related the issue i.e. warranty status of the HD which we have to email the OEM and await their reply. Which will extend the SLA even though the main issue has been resolved. \n Do you get the customer to create a new ticket or keep the ticket open?\n For me i think it is a bad practice to keep the ticket open, from my experience usually we'd get the customer to create a new ticket. \n But then again, back then i was working for companies had some of control i.e. HPE, big IT corps. \n But the new company i just joined, i am still getting used to the practice, and i was wondering if i should address this as this might give the customer too much power to dictate and of course my previous question\n I find such practices bad and is making things very confusing which in turn would reduce productivity.\n ​\n Am i wrong?\n Or should i address this? \n I dont wanan address something that would shoot myself in the foot\n    submitted by    /u/ChmodPlusEx  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I just had this discussion and it reminded me that I wanted to raise this point here.\n My current team lead gifted me with this concept - the turd system. A 'turd' is a task that shouldn't exist, doesn't make sense to exist in its current form, and is a pain in the ass to handle, especially in bulk. Turds tends to naturally accumulate into heaps of shit, until either some poor responsible souls goes shovel them, or they get stomped down the drain.\n My team lead is of the firm beliefs that it's a good thing for turds to accumulate, as this triggers the 'turd system' - someone eventually complains that the turds aren't being passed in a timely fashion, and after a few iterations this provides the impetus to restructure or remove the task so as to eliminate the source of turds.\n This strikes me as something that is typical of organizations in general. Dumb shit creates work no one wants to do it, least of all the people who realize it's pointless. If someone handles it, that process never gets reviewed. However, if it's left to break, then eventually decision-makers will resign themselves to changing the process.\n Does your shop have a turd system too?\n    submitted by    /u/senove2900  \n [link]   [comments]",

It helps Outlook users handle those emails with extra attention. \n Now admins can switch from the transport rule as it has few disadvantages,\n  \nIt takes up a lot of space in the subject line, making it hard to preview the subject.\n As the transport rule might not be aware of the end user’s language, it leads to localization issues.\n Multiple external tags: If the external users keep replying to the thread, it will add multiple [External] tags in the subject.\n When you reply to the external email, they won't get any clue that you have enabled external tagging.\n  \nAdmins can enable it through PowerShell.

Actually, what I am asking is the best practice covering both security and ease of access, how are you guys implementing a similar case?\n I should mention that we are not using LAPS or any other Endpoint Privilege Management software, we are considering this scenario though.\n    submitted by    /u/johnenxada  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I apologize if this post is against the rules. I'm not asking for support. I'm wanting to either confirm or deny a perception I've made.\n It seems like Windows can occasionally become erratic in small ways until I install pending updates. This can be anything from weirdness with a mouse being difficult to control to losing internet connection on a single machine seemingly at random. Other devices are fine. What has me pointing to Windows updates specifically is that even though my apps, test pings, etc. all return error responses Windows update can sure as shit download updates and install them no problem.\n These usually go away with the handy dandy restart as well (even if I don't install the updates yet) but crop up soon again before long. I've noticed this for years and ran into it again today (the no internet issue specifically) and finally thought to ask. Between these periods my experience is pretty good until they happen again and quite usually there are pending updates. Rinse and repeat. It's not even an every time thing though quite often I am prompt about installing them once I notice the icon. Occasionally when I'm not though is when I've noticed this behavior.\n What gives? Am I mixing correlation/causation? It's hard to imagine Windows having poison pill code to prod users into installing updates, but honestly it wouldn't surprise me either.\n Edit: Thank god I'm not alone. 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/derplordthethird  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I set out to implement syncing with cloud-hosted Snipe-It, I wanted a solution flexible enough to deal with possible problems in the source data. The result is a set of PowerShell scripts utilizing snazy2000's excellent SnipeitPS module ( https://github.com/snazy2000/SnipeitPS). The main premise is flexibility, working off cache wherever possible, and creating and assigning entities in snipe-it when needed (departments, companies, locations, etc.). The scripts can be found on github at https://github.com/mattcarras/SnipeItSyncPS.\n Quick tidbits about each script:\n - SnipeIt-Sync-PS.ps1: The main API script, which is dot-sourced by the other two scripts. Requires snazy2000's SnipeitPS module.\n - SnipeIt-AD-Sync.ps1: Complete script for syncing user information from AD. Syncs the SID to the EmployeeNum field by default for greater flexibility. Supports all fields supported by SnipeitPS, including syncing info about departments, companies, and managers, as well as setting groups. Also supports flagging or deleting users which no longer exist in AD. Should work with minimal changes. Also technically supports updating passwords, it's recommended to use SSO instead.\n - SnipeIt-Asset-Sync.ps1: Script for syncing asset information from previously exported CSV, direct from SCCM via WMI, direct from AD, or direct WMI queries. You will need to set the fields in each function to match whatever you're importing.\n Hopefully the scripts may prove useful in some way. Feel free to build your own syncing solution using parts or all of the API. And while the scripts are currently being used in an enterprise environment without issue, feel free to submit bug reports on github if you encounter any problems.\n    submitted by    /u/mattcarras  \n [link]   [comments]",

Found that several user groups weren’t being governed by this policy and added them. Now I’m potentially in some dire straits…\n Some users who had newer versions than what we needed to use had their Chrome installs rolled back to the assigned version. When this happened, is basically reset the browser to zero - all bookmarks, passwords, auto fill data, etc. is gone. I verified by doing it to my computer that you can restore the data if you were signed into a Google account before the reset (sign back in and turn on sync).\n However, if a user wasn’t signed into a Google account before their browser was reset, does anyone know if there is any way to restore this data short of a full system rollback?\n    submitted by    /u/stignewton  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are letting Server 2019 handle the search database - not UPM or FSLogix - as per MS recommendation. We can see that the per-user database (.edb file) is created in the user profiles. However, they do not seem to update and the size of the .edb files never increases from the initial size of 8196 KB. \n When we look at the indexing status in Outlook, it shows that Outlook is a location that should be indexed, but it also shows that 0 items have been indexed. And it shows that 0 items are still needed to be indexed. \n On a normal Windows 10 PC with Outlook it shows how many items have been indexed. And I've read somewhere that the size of the per-user database .edb should increase, when indexing large mailboxes. \n So what is your experience - is it normal that Outlook shows 0 items indexed?

When booting up everything is ok, no errors, no faults, no lights...\n The drive passes ITDT health test with all passed. Since i only use lto6 at home i also only tested lto6. Speed it does in health test is 151 mb/s, not full 160, but no failure either.\n I then started full write test. That fails after about 1 hour with EC 6 in ITDT and F3 01 SCD 5 Dtive broken on the library. Wont accept tapes or anything unless powercycled. After powercycle all good.\n What i dont understand is, why does the drive pass health test but fails full write. Both failed ok, but one passed one failed doesnt add up for me.\n Use data: 12/2018 built, 1200 day Power on time, 40 power cycles, 40 cleans so far in lifetime, 3000 catridge loads.\n Newest firmware is installed.\n My first guess due to the high load count is worn out head. But can you really wear out a drive in just 3 years? My other hp drives are 8-10y old and work super fine. Or do you have any other ideas, suggestions, tips?\n If its the head: does anyone have a source for the spare? I am not afraid of a bit DIY, and wont pay 1500 eur to a company to fix it for my home use case (used just for me ar home, have 3 working lto6 drives so i am fine).\n Would be great to find some help.\n    submitted by    /u/modtta4455  \n [link]   [comments]",

Certificates are deployed and placed in the System keychain via MDM w/ access to the required cert granted to the AnyConnect VPN client.\n Everything else in our configuration can read and access keychain items without issue but AnyConnect appears to have a really hard time validating the certificate it needs.\n When a user is hit with the cert validation error, they can \"fix\" it by running \"security unlock-keychain\" in Terminal and successfully activate VPN on the next attempt.\n Is anyone else dealing with this in macOS Monterey as a consistent issue?\n    submitted by    /u/TacoNinja125  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did what I guess was the natural progression of 1st level helpdesk ->desktop support ->sys admin. Made it from my 1st job to sys admin in 2.5 years and aside from a few failed forays into other areas, I've remained a sys admin almost exclusively since early 2001. I had a brief go as a team leader/management and discovered very quickly it was not for me. \n I've been working project implementations exclusively for 5 years now and do enjoy the work. I tend to become the goto guy fairly quickly on projects (not saying I am perfect or know everything, far from it. I think it's just an age/experience thing and probably happens to everyone who has been around for 20+ years and a lot of the ppl I work with are younger than me)\n I'm curious about infra architecture roles but really don't know what the day to day is like and how to go about moving into that area.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Zealousideal_Ad642  \n [link]   [comments]",

I covered the full SC-900 - Microsoft Security, Compliance & Identity Fundamentals course in one video, the editing for this nearly killed me, well not really, it was just a lot of work to make lol.\n Anyway the video is about almost 5 hours long since it covers the whole dang course obviously. With that said, if someone is looking for something specific in the course, it would take them forever to find it so I added a list in the video description with most of the main topics that are covered with time stamps next to each topic.\n The time stamps will make it quicker and easier for people to find what they are looking for if they don't want to watch the whole thing and are just looking for something specific.\n I will be adding a extra video after the course which will have practice questions in it to help prepare for the exam. Now before anyone goes and asks, no, those practice questions are NOT the questions out of the actual official exam, those kinds of questions are against Microsoft's rules and not allowed.\n The practice questions I make will however cover the same topics and measure you on the same skills so they are legal and allowed by Microsoft.\n As I said in the beginning, I hope this helps some of you out since I know what it's like when your boss/company forces you to write an exam and not being able to find any study resources for it.\n Same can be said for folks who can't afford to pay courses or who just can't find anything online. This should plug that hole.\n Below is a short 4-5 min course intro video I made which explains the course.

Ltd, a company that appears to be based in South Korea.\n Extended Stored Procedure files extend the functionality of SQL queries by using an API that accepts remote user arguments and responds with unstructured data.\n Maggie abuses this technical behavior to enable remote backdoor access with a rich set of 51 commands.\n A report from DCSO CyTec says that the variety of commands supported by Maggie allow querying for system information, executing programs, interacting with files and folders, enabling remote desktop services (TermService), running a SOCKS5 proxy, and setting up port forwarding.\n The attackers can append arguments to these commands, and Maggie even offers usage instructions for the supported arguments in some cases.\n    submitted by    /u/GullibleDetective  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please do the needful to mitigate and provide turnaround time for resolution!\"\n Turns out, the resolver (the OS-component, not a DNS-Server) on some linux systems regularly checks the Root-NS directly for the trust anchors. Not really critical and can be turned off with 2 commands.\n What i found strange is that it has been like that for several years and only a handful of customers was either paranoid, curious or bored enough to actually notice this so far. \n So yeah...maybe look into that in advance if you have spare time before somethings pops up during an audit on the firewall and it becomes a high-prio issue.\n    submitted by    /u/Octa_vian  \n [link]   [comments]",

They don't have significant financial resources, but they're cresting the amount of \"random\" systems that I can support without some management capability. \n Setting up an entire active directory domain is extremely cost-prohibitive for them, so I'm looking for solutions. They already have a new Synology NAS, and it appears that Synology's offering for their Directory Server is pretty alright for what I think I need.\n I'm looking for a way to standardize accounts & permissions across their workstations, as well as a way to push group policies to the machines. It looks on the surface that all of this is supported. \n They currently use a paid Google service for all their email, etc. but I've also thought of Microsoft 365 for them if the juice is worth the squeeze. From what I've been reading, they'd be paying the same price, but I would get all the added benefit of AD features (not all, but the critical ones).\n So, my question is this... \n  \nDoes anyone here have any experience using Synology's DS offering?\n \nWhat are you using for secondary DNS? I know the primary DNS is recommended to be run on the Synology along with the DS. \n Currently DNS is on their pfsense, but I wouldn't mind turning that into the secondary if it would support all the weird things needed for DS to work correctly.\n \n Has anyone use the Microsoft 365 offering? Is that worth checking out? How does it handle Group Policy, etc.\n  \nI'm sure this conversation will evolve, but I'd love to hear folks impressions.\n Full disclosure: For my background, I spent 10 years as a Windows System admin from 2000-2010 and am very comfortable in that environment. I then switched careers into Cyber and now focus on OT, so I've been Linux focused for the last 12 or so.

I am happy everyone is being safe but I thought the warnings make it obvious.\n Again, curious what other people's strategies are for spoofed emails and warning the user base.\n (I would prefer to block them outright but, numerous Execs use personal gmail, yahoo, outlook etc. to email themselves)\n    submitted by    /u/cmaniac45z54  \n [link]   [comments]",

I came from a position where I was using SCCM for imaging, so I'm familiar with Task Sequences, but I'm familiar with SCCM TS, which are a bit different from the MDT. (SCCM provides more options in the TS - More steps that aren't available in vanilla MDT)\n That being said, I've got my TS to install the Operating System, but it won't install applications. If I try to install applications without rebooting, it says that it can't install applications from WinPE, so it's going to reboot. Then it reboots and never finishes the TS.\n From doing some Google searching, it seems that it's the WinRE that performs this step. However, I can't get my TS to boot into WinRE to do that step. When I do the reboot step, it reboots into the main Windows OS, and just finishes the windows setup. The steps after that reboot never run. What am I doing wrong?

But this is just like “working from home”.\n What I want is a second AD DS server over there which will act as a backup DC and allow “local” authentication, etc. Corporate laptops will therefore always be domain joined.\n Where do I begin?\n My research says something like purchasing: a router/firewall, a switch, a windows server, then the various cabling/infrastructure and probably an Aruba Instant-on AP for wireless.\n Do I configure the windows server to VPN on over to our domain? \n I’m getting a flight over and buying a Netgate 4100 running Pfsense. Do I configure the VPN there?\n I appreciate this is a big question and a big can of worms, and I can see why people might suggest employing a 3rd party network specialist to sort it over there, but I reckon getting over the domain join hurdle and setting up the firewall are the 2 only obstacles I have.\n Any thoughts greatly appreciated – thanks from an overworked, overhatted, accidental sysadmin.\n    submitted by    /u/saladnicoise  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n tldr: Got computers getting DHCP leases from the wrong VLAN\n Got a weird issue. At my current $job we have multiple VLANs for various systems, the basic network is CLIENT (untagged) --> Cisco Phone (Tagged) --> Meraki/Netgear Switch --> Cisco Nexus --> Router (VyOS) --> HyperFlex + Vmware --> Windows Server 2019 with DHCP (in fail over) + MDT Server.\n The VyOS router has DHCP relay listeners on all the client networks to route them to the Windows servers for DHCP (or MDT).\n Now the issue is VLAN 1 (as the default) is only used for network management, everything else is on their own VLANs.\n 100 - VoIP / 200-202 - Client / 300 - Servers\n So the issue is, some PCs (Dell desktops) or laptops (Dell Laptop + Dock OR Lenovo Laptop + Dock) picks up a DHCP offer from the wrong network. Some times it could be on the old client VLAN or currently it's attempting to bind to VLAN 1's range.\n Most of the PCs, if we get Windows (10 or 11) to do a network reset (or manually do netsh winsock reset & netsh ip int reset), the system comes good.\n Notes\n  \nStatically setting the IP address, allows the computer to work on the correct VLAN\n The computer gets the IP but fails to release OR communicate with anything (IE if it's on the wrong VLAN)\n All the DHCP is running from 2 servers in a failover configuration under M$ on Windows\n The computers are either freshly built or been running for about 3-9 months\n Everything is updated to the latest versions (as per M$ for Windows, Dell/Lenovo for drivers, Cisco/Netgear for switches, VyOS for router)\n Each port is configured for the native VLAN to be the correct client VLAN + the VoIP VLAN being tagged for the phones.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/nephi_aust  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I’m considering hosting my own mail server for this purpose.\n But self-hosting on a VPS can have outages…\n I don’t mind if some emails get lost if the senders don’t retry, but I don’t want them to stop sending me all together if my server goes down temporarily.\n Let’s say my server goes down for 1 or 2 days for whatever reason. (Let’s not discuss how likely it is. There may be an outage, or I may screw something up.) Also, let’s assume my server is either up or down, but when it’s up, it’s accepting mails normally. So, I’m not rejecting mails.\n So, the question is this: If there is a busy sender that sends out a huge number of emails, and they see my server went offline or port 25 is not responding for a day or two, then what happens? What’s the most common behaviour? Will they resume sending me when my server comes online again? Or will they consider me gone forever?\n Phrasing it in another way: How long would a receiving mail server need to be down in order for a busy sender to stop sending to it all together?\n Or does it depend on the sender and the situation, and there is no standard behaviour?\n The special situation here is that these are busy senders. I understand that normally a sender should and will retry. But when a sender sends out hundreds of emails a day or more to each of its subscribers, they may handle this differently.\n Again, I don’t mind lost mails, I just don’t want to re-subscribe to the newsletters after every outage I may have.\n And I don’t really want to have a backup MX unless I really need to.\n Some expert advice would be appreciated… Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/BurnedShipMan  \n [link]   [comments]",

It’s no secret that DevOps and cloud are some of the hottest spaces in IT right now.

So pretty general sysadmin in the modern world I would say.\n To create a plan of action, I’m looking to determine what skills to develop and how to prioritize them.

I am mostly interested in reads, not so much writes into the DB. As I said it is an API backend that mostly serves JSON via relatively simple selects and an occassional joint here and there - nothing too crazy though.\n I will probably off-load the homepage for not-logged in users and some mostly accessed parts of the app to Redis, but still, I want something that would work relatively well when it comes to the available 2 GB RAM even without Redis - at least from the beginning ;)\n It will be mostly mobile apps accessing the API, so frontend rendering etc. is not the problem here.\n Thanks for your recommendation and advice - especially if you have used Hetzner CX11 servers or some other servers like this with databases.\n    submitted by    /u/DragonfruitTasty7508  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are working as system administrators even though we do not access to a lot of stuff, we have a HQ group called Central , they have to give permissions for certain stuff( I assue they are level 2 or level 3 ). So recently for preaparation for Black Friday our packing department have been prepared and did some mock test with like 50 packers at the same time. \n The problem is that as soon as people (30-50 start to work the invoice from our printer gets really slow to print sometimes (1- 2 minutes, normally it takes like 5-10 second).\n We use DLX as a WMS. We have given a list to Central with all the cabinets and sockets that these printers are using so they can monitor it. They said they have not seen any slowness from that part. ok.\n In DLX we have a thing called \"Run Task\". It basically shows when the sytem processed the order. So if you check the time from the moment you press the print button after you packed an order until the run task actually run you can see the time it took to process it. its quick like couple seconds. ok. \n And then we have a print server where we have all the printers added ( something like a print host). This is the last idea we have currently to check how long does it take from the DLX to send the information to this print server. Everything we have checked or sent to Central came back as no issues or signs for slowness.\n Also its confusing because during people's breaktime there were like 25 packers only, printing went back to like 5 second. And then after an hour with like 30 or 35 ish people it just slowed down to 1 minute again. ( it is kind of inconsistent.)\n ​\n Does anybody have any other idea what would worth to be checked?\n    submitted by    /u/Nervous_Lab_4287  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have just a bit of experience with scripting, but mainly simple commands (I don't dare calling them scripts) like get-something|foreach{ do some stuff}. And I composed this first big script that I intend to use in automated AzAD user provisioning. \n The script will take the employee data (Firstname, lastname, workmail, etc) from the HR System (BambooHR) with an API call and it then creates users/modify them in AzAD using a foreach loop, some identifiers from BambooHR attributes+AzAD attributes and IFs to identify the operations needed to be performed. I also wanted to have logging as good as possible, there are still some things to be improved on this part too. It's not yet completed, this is the first working and tested version, (I did run it in production, yes :) but before I did, I exported every single user attribute/licenses info to a csv and prepared a script to restore everything back to the state using this csv) I will also adjust the documentation based on the final result. I'm also thinking of a better...logical way to go for 3 big IF-s. But I was thinking, what else can I use instead of those many many If-s? I thought of array comparison, but there would still be IF-s....some custom function? Please let me know some suggestions, and how good I'm doing.\n Overall, the script performance looks \"ok\" from my perspective (the company has less than 150 employees right now) and, when it had to modify about 10 users and create 2 accounts, it took 2 minutes to run.

I think we found if N-Able is on the device it takes over all elements of the patching aspect and ignores Intune.\n In any case we are meandering options but would be good to know what you do.\n Another question - if you set the target release on a device does that prompt it to update immediately or does that just say to the device you can only go up to this release as and when its made available?\n ​\n Many thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Wu-Disciple  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically every place I've seen PDQ. Sure, PDQ added LAPS functionality somewhat recently, but I haven't seen a client that has used LAPS with PDQ.

After checking, I realize how easily we let users access the organization's information without any privileges. To make you all aware of this setting, I came up with a blog that includes the steps to restrict users' access to Azure AD data and PowerShell modules. But, I got a negative impact from a few Redditors saying that it is invalid and nothing can be changed with this setting as it is a directory.\n Though it is a directory, do non-admins really need to access the organization's information? Even one single vulnerability can easily break the security chain nowadays. Isn't it? But, the comments made me conclude that restricting user access is not as significant as other security measures. \n But today, I came across an update from MS on the recent two zero-day vulnerability issues and the required mitigation steps. Their strong recommendation is to disable the non-admin access to the remote PowerShell module.

I have a SuperMicro CSE-118 lying around with an Intel 340-T4 (Quad Port RJ45) and an Intel X520-DA2 (SFP+) in it which I would use as an pfSense Server.\n Would it be possible to connect 4 Ports of the 5G Router to the Server, link aggregate them, connect the SFP-Port to a switch, and distribute the whole possible bandwith of 2Gbit to other devices?\n This is just a rough idea and I haven't thought about possible hickups (or none came to my mind thinking about this)\n Thank you all in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Suggestion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every crime initiates with going over all the organization information to uncover the weakest links in the security chain to creep in their attack. Thus, their key target would be standard users, as getting their credentials using password spray or purchasing via cybercriminal economy becomes effortless.\n Few days back, I wrote a blog with the steps to restrict users' access to the Azure AD portal. When considering Office 365 environment, the organization info will be scattered and viewable through multiple places like Azure AD portal, PowerShell, MS Graph, etc.But, many Redditors commented it was invalid and unnecessary as it is a directory. \n Though it is a directory and non-admins have access to it, do they really use portal.azure.com or PowerShell to view Azure information? Even a single loophole make the attack worse. Moreover, why shouldn't we restrict them from accessing crucial information when we can do it? What's the point in letting the weakest security link be active right before our eyes? Isn't it essential to restrict them?\n    submitted by    /u/Clara_jayden  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have checked DNS (it never is DNS but everything in me is screaming it is...), LAN settings, everything... However we still cannot seem to find the issue.\n We even went as far to try and add google DNS or open DNS to one of the servers DNS server to no avail.\n ​\n Any pointers?\n ​\n EDIT (mostly for laughter)...: Router settings somehow got reset and was blasting DHCP over the network. This blocked everything. Turning DHCP off and restarting the servers solved everything. Still weird how nothing about this showed up in eventviewer.\n    submitted by    /u/sjsame1  \n [link]   [comments]",

The high score I recorded so far is 135 days of uptime. I’ve had users complain they’re falling behind because of their computers performance speed. Users who don’t restart because restarting takes forever to boot. Users who insist they tried restarting multiple times before reaching out to the help desk. There are many examples but my favorite come from power users who try to resolve the problem without restarting thus making the issue more complex.\n I share with you all my journey of enlightenment.

While working I'll sometimes put Mark Russinovich Case of the Uxexplained talks on and listen to them in background. Nearly all the time I'll suddenly hear a bit I've never noticed before.\n Remember in the old company I was in we had a weird issue on laptops only. Still on XP (they were behind. Was in about 2012) The user would go to explorer and the laptops would freeze for about 5 mins. Then eventually the network drives would appear. I'd grab process monitor traces where I could but instead of giving me time to look our manager would say \"Just rebuild them. Don't waste time\". Rebuilding them was a cocking waste of time.\n Eventually her own laptop got hit with the issue just as she was going on leave. So convinced her to let me look at hers. Ran process monitor as it happened but couldn't see anything obvious so ran process explorer. Just like in Task Manager you could see explorer at 50% but we all know task manager is useless. Looked into the explorer deeper with procexp and could see one .dll it was using running at 50%\n Ooo, could it be that? The .dll was being used by PGP the software we used to encrypt the laptops. Googled what the .dll did. All it did was scan the network looking for encrypted files so it could change their icon. We never used encrypted files so wasn't needed & apparently there were rare issues with it. So I unregistered it.\n Problem solved. Now instead of having to rebuild the laptops that took quite a while, I could fix them in under 5mins.\n I still take traces of issues wherever I can to look at them later. Started to build up a collection now and keep notes with the traces where I used the tools to fix issues.\n    submitted by    /u/steviefaux  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have choosen one, the SuperMicro X12SCA-F (pictured here) but I have some questions about adding a 10 GB network card on it.\n I have already an ASUS NVMe PCIe x16 Card, which allows me to add up to 4 NVMe Drives (4 x 4 x 4 x 4 lanes) destined to be mounted on the first PCIe slot (X16).\n Consequently, the 2nd PCIe x16 slot will be disconnected.

          "description": "Hello,\n apparently there is a function in the MS Office applications to send an email with the spreadsheet directly from the application (now I know it).\n Last month (a week after the August patches were applied) the first user from company A complains that this function does not work and an authentication window appears. -> enter AD credentials -> \"general error - restart microsoft excel\", window appears again. Tried domain-netbios\\username, username@domain-fqdn and username only. Since it's not really a critical function, just dragging and dropping the file from File Manager into Outlook, I decided to put the ticket on hold until I have time to investigate.\n Today (Sunday) the 2nd manager of company B called me that this is not working, tried the same -> no success.\n My findings so far:\n - All systems with issues are Windows 2016 Server with Office 2016 (sometimes 32 bit, sometimes 64 bit), September Windows and Office patches applied, both RDS farms and Citrix systems.\n - The issue may have been introduced with the August patches and has not been fixed with the September patches.\n - Sending an email from Word works fine, Outlook opens and the user can write their message.\n - it's not user specific it's maschine-wide\n - it seems that only customers with on prem exchange have problems, IMAP / POP seems fine, exchange online is not used by our customers, so i can't test.\n - Googling was not really helpful -> only old articles with reinstalling Office.\n ​\n Does anyone else have a similar problem? Anyone have any ideas ?\n ​\n Edit: All systems are fully OnPrem with also fully patched DCs; If I add an pop / imap account to the outlook profile and make it the default one everything works.\n    submitted by    /u/minimaximal-gaming  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I have just spend a whole day trying (and failing) to implement an internal CA setup. One offline Root and one intermediary to issue certs. I was following one or two guides I found on the internet.\n Turns out, internet outdates way too quickly. A test cert I issued to a website got outright rejected by Google Chrome (with no option to move forward) despite having the whole cert chain imported to my system. \n I ran a cert lint tool on the certs using online (https://crt.sh/lintcert) tool, and it spew out so many errors, I was questioning my ability as a sysadmin. \n I won't go into details of what the errors are since they are pointless at this stage. But stuff like mandatory Subject alternative names, and the abolishment of CNs, requirement for policy extensions, are some of the few things that have changed over the past few years, and none of the guides I used bothered to address any of this either.\n Hence, my question is, do any of you guys have a good reference guide that I can follow to create an internal CA the way the internet overlords intended in the current day and age, since apparently all the guides I have followed on the internet are all very much outdated. \n And yes, I am aware I can bypass these warnings by manual adding to chrome, and using secret codes or whatever, but remember that this is going to be used in a real production environment so such work arounds are not a permanent solution. \n P.S. For OpenSSL only please. I don't want to touch Windows ADCS.\n    submitted by    /u/CatMDV  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Someone else is going to run into this request, and the vendor's documentation is very frustrating. So here are some tips to help you along the way. \n The Lexis Nexis has enabled support for modern auth in the Time Matters Exchange Sync tool, but in their article https://community.pclawtimematters.com/pclaw16/s/article/Exchange-Sync-ModernAuth\n they don't give you any information on the API permissions required. Instead, they direct you to ask a Certified Partner. \n I wish they just said \"The API needs to write/read the mailboxes using EWS with OAuth authentication\" or really any indication of the required function/permissions.\n ​\n So, if you're trying to set this up: \n  \nInstall at least TM 16.6\n Create an Enterprise application in Azure, create a corresponding client secret\n Verify that OAuth2 is enabled for the tenant\n You need permissions for the API to Exchange Web Services using full_access_as_app\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/how-to-authenticate-an-ews-application-by-using-oauth#configure-for-app-only-authentication\n Reconfigure the Exchange sync on the server with the API values and verify the connection\n \n Hope this saves someone else some time.

I came to work, no-touch-Fridays and got through some tasks, and my nagios screen went red. Like…a lot of red.\n Came back about 2 minutes later…weird.\n About and hour later, same thing. This time I could see a pattern of what was down…a remote site and everything AFTER it went down. I called the site, no answer, which is normal sometimes people are not there. \n I start logging into switches, seeing some Spanning Tree stuff in the logs, nothing too out of sorts. Sweating a bit, wondering wtf is going on…do I know spanning tree enough (does anyone?) whats going on here. \n About another hour goes by and I finally get a callback. The site was moving furniture and powered everything down..including the ‘splitter’. The what? You don’t have a switch there. Turns out the people before me put in a 8 port switch and stuck it behind the desk. I look it up, its a smart-ish switch with spanning tree, and older than dirt. No documentation saying its there, or what its doing. But its powered back up and everything is working much better now. \n Monday they get a new switch…but until then I need to calm down.\n    submitted by    /u/jdlnewborn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well what do you mean the phone isn’t working, is their no dial tone? No he says, the phone has no power at all. \n This immediately peaked my interest with a small side of anxiety and dread as to what I might discover. So I walk over to that side of the office. We have a whole floor of a building and this was on the opposite side from my office. We have 3 core Poe switches on our side and have a fiber circuit running too a single 48 port poe switch. \n Too make the long story short, the single Poe switch decided to kill itself. Luckily we got a few data only ports to work for the printers. Otherwise the marketing team would have murdered us. So not the end of the world, but I swear it’s always on a damn Friday.

The crew is great, and I have awesome work/life balance (which is why I joined in the first place). But, the pay stinks (I knew this going in, I had a 30% pay cut from my previous employer), even though we are in a union. \n Received a call with our main vendor for our computer database system and are curious if I would like to join them for 2x my current pay (35k) (which isn't a lot, I'm on food stamps) and the work would be remote. \n My chief worry is the economy. Sure the job doesn't pay well, but it's secure. And I fear a possible recession. I see advice on this thread all the time that the best way to get a raise is to change jobs, but I've also been reading that now may not be a great time to do so. \n And, I'm a loyal employee, loyal to a fault, which in the United States, I know conceptually, is a very bad thing to be, but I still feel emotionally that I'm betraying the trust of my coworkers and team. \n I'm scared to even ask for more details on the job offer. I'm stressed now, due to my family finances, so I'm worried that I may make a rash move. \n Sigh, any advice is appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Seathttrail  \n [link]   [comments]",

That did nothing except get one of our mailservers on a gmail blocklist (lots of lost emails). (I can't 100% guarantee there was a correlation, but the timeline fits very well..)

So many external services we rely on don't support IPv6. Github for one doesn't. Docker's registry doesn't. Most of the CPAN mirrors (yeah, we use Perl in a few places) don't. A lot of Ubuntu's repository mirrors don't. It's actually easier to list the things that *do* support it than the things that don't, it's a sad and very small list. \n So tell me, how to transit to a full IPv6 stack when 90% of external services flat out don't support it, and (in Github's case at any rate) don't seem too interested in getting it to work?\n    submitted by    /u/blockstackers  \n [link]   [comments]",

Keep in mind I'm a junior sysadmin at best so I'll try to include all the needed details while keeping them sanitized. \n Quick run down: I have a ipsec site to site vpn between two networks with 1Gb duplex connections through two pfsense 7000 series firewall appliances. Connection is stable however iperf only shows a bandwidth of 68 Mbps with transfer capping out at 8.50 MBytes from two hyper-v vm on either side of the tunnel. File transfers from local to remote site are also very slow at 20Mbps. While these speeds may work for my use case temporarily I can't help but feel I am missing something to speed this connection up.\n Steps I have taken to attempt to speed this up:\n Set MSS clamping to 1396 after calculating my OMSS. Sniffed before and after the changes and it fixed a fragmentation issue but speeds are unchanged. Using UDP over IPv4 for tunnel.\n Ensure there was no duplex mismatch on any NIC and no traffic shaping is in place.\n CPU's are mostly idle and a combined usage of less then 15%\n Asynchronous Cryptography is on, compression is off, no rules conflict with traffic.\n Any thoughts? I am at a loss and about to attempt another VPN option in the mean time to see if I can get better speeds elsewhere.\n    submitted by    /u/boringlichlight  \n [link]   [comments]",

As always it needs to be done on the cheap. \n We need to allow multiple end users, take a photo and upload it to only their specific user folder which they have access to. So I'm thinking a cloud based storage product where i just pay for how much storage i want rather than by user (as that is where it gets expensive, be about 150 users). That product would sync to on-prem AD. The users would log into the app with their domain user/pass and then only be able to see the one folder in the cloud storage product which they have access too where they can simply just add a photo.\n I presume this is quite a easy task but if anyone has any recommendations that would be fantastic.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/315hughes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In case it matters: The region is The Netherlands, Europe.\n About 5,5 years ago I started my IT career fresh out of school. I didn't know anything and learned everything on the go starting with level 1 servicedesk at a ~25-man MSP. Over the past years I managed to step up and implement/solve more complex stuff. I went from rookie to network engineer configuring routers, firewalls and switches in complex setups. On the side I also was \"un-official\" teamlead of support by now. Teaching the new guys the ropes - I was the go to guy for most people to come to who were at our office. It became taxing on me: The workload was high and this made the place unsociable. The mandatory on-call shifts (one full week every 6 weeks on average) were very busy too, often clocking 4-8 additional hours outside of regular times. On top of that the pay was bad too, fairly below market average for a lot of employees on the team (people talked about it which management did not like of course, berating those who discussed it).\n Upcoming Monday I am starting a new job, I am leaving the MSP world and starting as a sysadmin at a company with about 85 employees. Working 36 hours (49) for about the same pay I got when working 40 hours (58). There is one other sysadmin who has been there for about 8 years now and the focus of the company is software development for a webservice they are hosting.\n The reason I am posting this is to gather input of other people who have made the same switch, how did life change for you? Did you run into surprises, is there any advice I should hear?\n Any input/advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot.\n    submitted by    /u/Stevanti  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I did all the usual troubleshooting and internally everything was fine. External email was getting to the Barracuda ok but not being delivered to exchange. All “tests” passed and the Barracuda could send me test emails. I also discovered if I re-queued a message it would go back to deferred but if I skipped the scan engine and just flat out deliver it, the mail would show up… Must be something with email scanning so I reboot the appliance. That doesn’t fix it so I call Barracuda and open a case. The tech said he’s been doing it these calls all night. They pushed out a bad update and I locked up a scanning engine service. A reboot doesn’t clear it. I had to start up the troubleshooting remote connection so the tech could push out an update and restart the service. I couldn’t have done it myself as they lock that ability behind support.\n TLDR: If you’re having trouble with external emails getting stuck in the queue on your Barracuda after Wednesday night, then call support.

The guy who was doing anything with tech is my manager, the director of operations. There's a couple of people who have slapped together some scripts, and my manager's experience is somewhere around \"has built a gaming PC\". They use an MSP for managing anything that's above my manager's capacity and my job is to bring that in house.\n Honestly I'm really liking it. It's a small company of around 60 users and I've got a whole list of projects to accomplish and I've added a couple of my own ideas to the list, I think I can really tighten things up and get them running a bit more smoothly, get some disaster recovery procedures in place, etc. I'm feeling strangely confident in my ability to do what is being asked of me. That's not what I'm here for today.\n I'm only a few weeks in and this company hasn't really had an actual IT guy before, they've just had Chad the Ops Guy calling vendors. So, in order to help ease myself into a company that has a few decades of experience running but zero experience having an actual IT guy I want to do some user training of sorts. I want to do a sort of informal getting to know you and you getting to know me and what I can do with the title and theme being the title of this post.\n I have a few ideas for what sort of stuff goes in there, but I'd love to have your input. Folks who have started at small companies that haven't had IT people before them, what are the weird growing pains as companies get used to your presence? What won't the company expect about what my position brings to the table?

          "description": "Hello All,\n We're curious how other IT professionals are managing ex-employees' mailboxes when they leave the company. The organization is experiencing rapid growth and we've found our current process isn't scalable. We use Microsoft 365, but our users have the desktop applications such as Outlook through VL. Currently, when an employee leaves the company either through termination or resignation, we add ourselves to the ex-employee's 365 account and perform a manual export of their mailbox to a PST. This PST gets saved and stored on our file server forever. Seems fairly simple when it's listed like that, but it's quite a tedious process from start to finish. You need to give yourself access to that person's mailbox, let it pull in their mail on Outlook which usually takes at least an hour if not more before it becomes accessible, (and you'd be surprised at how big we let employees' mailboxes get to), and then perform the export which again, depending on the mailbox size could just freeze your Outlook up for some time. Now ironically enough we recently found that it looks like you could do all of that in the Compliance center in 365, but we still want to look at our overall process and reassess. Do we really need to keep these employees' mailboxes forever? Does 30 days suffice and then we blow it away (with exceptions of course)? Converting to shared mailboxes seems to be a popular method - what does that look like long-term? Do you use a third-party cloud solution to archive mailboxes? \n In short, we're just looking to explore how other businesses retain 365 mailboxes to determine our options. \n Thank you in advance. \n    submitted by    /u/Maverick10121  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also, the SMTP will be disabled for tenants who never used the protocol previously.\n Then, what are we going to do with this deprecation?\n All we need to do is to switch to Modern authentication.\n  \nIMAP/POP: Now, OAuth 2.0 support for POP, IMAP, and SMTP Auth protocols have been released, so users can switch to OAuth.\n Exchange ActiveSync: If your organization still using Exchange ActiveSync, you can use Outlook Mobile clients to connect with Exchange Online.\n Do you spend more time on Remote PowerShell to access Exchange Online? Then, use Exchange Online PowerShell V2 Module which supports modern auth.\n You can begin updating your users' client applications to OAuth 2.0 versions.\n Your code must be updated to use OAuth 2.0 if you have written using protocols with Basic Authentication.\n You need to contact the developers of the 3rd party application and ask them to update it to support OAuth 2.0 or switch to an application that supports Modern authentication.\n  \nFor more details on the basic auth deprecation and its solution, check out this article.\n https://blog.admindroid.com/basic-authentication-deprecation-in-exchange-online/\n    submitted by    /u/Embry_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Have you made sure your organization is ready for the deprecation of basic authentication in Exchange Online?\n  \n⚠️ Microsoft will begin to disable basic authentication for Exchange Online on October 1, 2022.\n  \nSo, what will be the impacts of basic auth deprecation?\n Overall, Microsoft will disable basic authentication in Exchange Online for the following protocols:\n  \nExchange ActiveSync (EAS)\n POP\n IMAP\n Remote PowerShell\n Exchange Web Services (EWS)\n Offline Address Book (OAB)\n Outlook for Windows and Mac\n  \nGot you screaming! Is SMTP protocol also being deprecated by Microsoft?\n No, SMTP isn't being deprecated. But if you stop using it for a while, your SMTP protocol will be disabled. Also, the SMTP will be disabled for tenants who never used the protocol previously.\n Then, what are we going to do with this deprecation?\n All we need to do is to switch to Modern authentication.\n  \nIMAP/POP: Now, OAuth 2.0 support for POP, IMAP, and SMTP Auth protocols have been released, so users can switch to OAuth.\n Exchange ActiveSync: If your organization still using Exchange ActiveSync, you can use Outlook Mobile clients to connect with Exchange Online.\n Do you spend more time on Remote PowerShell to access Exchange Online? Then, use Exchange Online PowerShell V2 Module which supports modern auth.\n You can begin updating your users' client applications to OAuth 2.0 versions.\n Your code must be updated to use OAuth 2.0 if you have written using protocols with Basic Authentication.\n You need to contact the developers of the 3rd party application and ask them to update it to support OAuth 2.0 or switch to an application that supports Modern authentication.\n  \nFor more details on the basic auth deprecation and its solution, check out this article.\n https://blog.admindroid.com/basic-authentication-deprecation-in-exchange-online/\n    submitted by    /u/Embry_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I raised a Support Request with Mimecast over a week ago and have had no response at all, which is rubbish.\n So domain.com is currently in 365 TenantA with MX pointing directly to Microsoft and we will be bringing this domain into our 365 TenantB. We use Mimecast for our email security, so this domain will be added here too. My previous plan for these types of migrations has been:\n 1) Change MX of domain.com to something invalid. Emails will queue and retry at sender for an unknown period. 2) Add domain to 365 and add aliases. 3) Add domain to Mimecast and perform directory sync from 365 so Mimecast is aware of all the new aliases. 4) Change MX to Mimecast.\n This works well, with the exception of the unknown behaviour when switching to the bogus MX records.\n It got me wondering; is there a way with Mimecast that we could bring the domain in earlier, maybe even pre-migration, so that when I start the rip out of the domain from TenantA, Mimecast will queue email and then ultimately deliver when all the aliases are added to TenantB?

I'm looking for some recommendations on how to segment the network and also recommendations on securing the Guest network.\n We are going with Ubiquiti/Unifi equipment. When everything is all said and done we will have:\n  \nUDM/router\n POE Switch\n 4 WAPs\n 6 (or so) outside security cameras\n 1 badge reader for door access\n 1 video doorbell\n 6 smart TVs\n I think that's it but will update if I think of anything else\n  \nThe couple computers that are used only need internet access. There will not be a file server or the need to share files. All that is done through OneDrive/Teams which just needs internet.\n ​\n What recommendations would anyone have for different networks to have? I was envisioning possibly 3 networks:\n  \nMain Network\n Guest Network\n IOT Network (not sure if we need this one)\n  \nThe Main Network would be for all the stuff in the list about except the TVs.\n The Guest Network could be for the handful of computers they have. These could also go on the Main Network but I don't think there's any real need for that. Could go either way on this one. Smart devices could go here.\n The IOT Network could be for the TVs and any other \"smart\" devices that might get added down the road. Again, not sure if this is actually needed as these could just go on the Guest Network.\n ​\n The other question is, How would you recommend we secure the Guest Network?\n  \nWide Open - Company Computers would then go on the Main Network\n WPA Key - Post a key on a sign, people can connect to it just like any other network. Smart devices could go on this network\n Wide Open w/ Terms & Condition - Need to click \"I Agree\" like at a hotel - This is annoying at times and some equipment doesn't handle that sort of interface very well. Smart devices would probably need an IOT network then.\n  \n​\n Thanks for any input and ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/kelemvor33  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have recently passed AWS SAA C02, CKA. I have gone thru some courses on Ansible, jenkins, Terraform, Python to understand all the moving pieces in the world of DevOps. I have done some small projects at my home lab to get an understanding of these technologies. \n I have started looking at the job market this month and started noticing very few postings. (I am based in Canada, looking for opportunities in US and Canada). \n I spoke to few of my friends and colleagues who are in the industry and i have got mixed opinions. Some say, DevOps job roles won't be affected even if we end up in a recession. Some say, just stick to my current job (stable job) until the dust settles. \n I m really confused of what to do. Should i wait until early next year or should I continue with my job search. \n Please advise.\n    submitted by    /u/kkt_98  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve checked this log and can’t see any errors? \n I’ve filtered the event ID 1125 on one particular server and it’s very random. One day it happened 4 times, another day twice and some days not at all. I’m really stumped, nothing appears broken on the GPO front, the furthest the error ID 1125 goes back is Jan 2022. Looking back through them again it’s very random when the error is logged. \n Just curious if anyone else has these event IDs regularly in their environment \n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/Clear_Kale5947  \n [link]   [comments]",

The colleague has been involved with app support for the past two years. He has made zero contributions to any scripts, processes or improvements. A few months ago I figured out he hasn't logged into the app in several months. Now that I am transitioning support to him, he only does support when specifically asked. No insightful questions, or how does XYZ work, or request for meetings to show feature ABC. I am the one who has to chase him to show him how to do things.\n During a critical issue where I was on the call with the vendor, the colleague seemed \"Away\" in Teams. I told my manager (tactfully) that I need to show my colleague how the issue was resolved, but he is away. Manager just said, \"Yes, continue to work with him and let him do the work\".\n I have a feeling this will come back to me some how. I was thinking of keeping a record of all meetings, how-to sessions, meeting invites etc. Later on, if this does come back to me, I will just my manager what was done to transition support.\n    submitted by    /u/txs2300  \n [link]   [comments]",

Setting up servers, etc. I’ve always been SUPER into hardware (passion).\n But lately I’ve been setting up our new hosting servers for the company im at because they trusted me enough to move from managed hosting environment to rented servers where we manage the hosting ourselves.\n Most hosting clients are past clients where we made their sites. We host a few hundred but obviously want to increase.\n Im looking into collocation, but honestly I’m super surprised at the cost of servers. We are in South Africa so there aren’t many big DC providers. So only when we get a few servers would we look at collocation, but how “worth it” is hardware like Xeon CPU’s? I see there are now some new Intel consumer level CPUs that support ECC, and most new AMD CPUs support ECC. So for largely Wordpress and NodeJS environments is there an issue with going with AMD? Is there something I’m missing?\n Honestly I’m just not sure where to start with hardware, I’ve learnt what I can in theory, but real world reasons for certain choices, and advice is very different. \n This post was a bit of a ramble but I guess I’m just looking for any good nuggets from you pros 🙂\n    submitted by    /u/Jordz2203  \n [link]   [comments]",

I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.\n I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...\n But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI.\n I'd prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc.

Launching any other application gives the error ‘this operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer’\n These accounts are only a problem with this server, it’s the only one they would normally access\n I’ve cleared down the local accounts from there, including the registry.

However, the loss is a bit high (no link possible) so we wanted to try 1550nm which of course has better attenuation figures, but I can’t locate any QSFP28 100G modules operating at 1550nm??\n Funnily enough though I have found posts in this subreddit with people saying that at 80KM all DWDM modules will be 1550nm - but the exact opposite seems to be true.\n The loss over the link appears to be about 23-26dBm according to our 10G 1650nm 80KM modules, so I’d expect at 1310 it’s closer to 36db of loss.\n I assume the recommendation would be EDFA, but any other suggestions for reliable 100G over this link would be appreciated :)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/TryTurnItOffAndOnAgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the Windows side of thing everything is working flawlessly but I'm struggling to get a working MAB policy on NPS for the IP Phones (This model does not support 802.1x) \n I have seen a few methods of configuring MAB on NPS. One involves setting up a user with username/password as the MAC address. This wont work in my environment as the password is just getting rejected due to complexity requirements. \n The 2nd method I have seen involves setting up a connection request policy like so : \n Conditions: \n  \nNAS Port Type = Ethernet\n Calling Station ID = ^00-00-00-00-00$|^11-11-11-11-11$ \n  \nAuthentication: \n  \n'Accept users without verifying credentials'\n  \nThe the switchport is configured like so: \n interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1 description Access-Port switchport access vlan 101 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 107 access-session host-mode multi-domain access-session closed access-session port-control auto mab dot1x pae authenticator spanning-tree portfast spanning-tree bpduguard enable service-policy type control subscriber DOT1X2MAB end \n When connecting the PC works fine, but the IP phone is failing , then the switchport gets err disabled as a result.

          "description": "I'm in a bind to look for an elegant solution to get the following failover solution working and I wondered if anyone here might have any ideas? \n Diagram as follows : Diagram \n Simple two site setup with both sites having their own WAN link for internet as well as site to site connectivity. \n The MPLS wans are setup with eBGP so each Cisco router receives the prefix of the other site via that WAN link for reachability to each other. \n The LANs of both routers are setup with two subnets and are setup using VRRP. with each router acting as the active VRRP group for each subnet: \n Site1 : 192.168.1.254\n Site2 : 192.168.0.254\n VRRP is setup so in the event of the WAN going down the other router takes over as VRRP master. \n This means that as well as resilience that both WAN links are fully utilised instead of all traffic just using the one WAN link. All good! \n The issue is that due to the point to point interface and VRRP that if the point to point dies so site1 can no longer reach site2 using the point to point that you would want that traffic to go out via the WAN into the MPLS to reach the other site. \n The problem is of course it won't do that due to each of the Cisco routers having LAN's which belong to both subnets. So if traffic was going from Site1 to Site2 then as soon as those packets destined for 192.168.0.0/24 hit the Site1 router then it would just not send it out's its WAN as it has an interface belonging to that subnet which is up and part of the VRRP group. \n This is the problem I'm trying to solve. A solution which I don't like is to create a EMM script which will shut down that LAN in the event traffic is no longer using the P2P but I don't like how messy that could be. \n Anyone got any ideas or suggestions then I'm open to them :) \n I hope that made at least some sense?\n    submitted by    /u/Busbyuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I work for a company with around 200 sites around the country and a pretty big DC with ACI, ISE, SD-WAN etc.... all across these sites.\n The normal way of doing things like segregating users has been via VLANS and FW rules. However with this new site I've setup and tested an 802.1x config I've done with TEAP for Windows users, EAP-TLS for MAC'S and MAB for cameras etc... all working. My plan was to see what AD group the user coming into ISE was in and the delegate them a VLAN tag on ISE and pass it back to the Authenticator switch, it all works. But after speaking to my lead today, he suggested a couple of things or ways of going about doing user segregation at the new site.\n We have been talking about what is the best way to go about IP addressing schemes for users at the site, do we create seperate VLAN's for infrastructure/networks, finance, HR etc.... with their own subnets or do we put them all into one big range (a big broadcast L2 domain I know, but kit these days can handle it to be honest) and then look to use SGT's on ISE and assign them segregation based off them that way.\n Any opinions or other suggestions would be welcome.\n Thanks everyone\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a small-ish site that provides Internet or managed network access to a few hundred remote SATCOM terminals via a small number of high bandwidth uplinks. My background is in radio networking (MANET, microwave, trunked voice & data, etc) but I'm fairly competent with Cisco R&S gear.\n This site has been badly neglected and is in acute need of a tech refresh. It currently has about 12-14 access switches and six routers that manage IP traffic between the modems and other infrastructure, and an old ASA that connects to the Internet and provides remote access via AnyConnect. I plan to replace the switches and routers pretty quickly, and the firewall soon after.\n I'm going to write a preliminary proposal to outline the tech refresh project and justify funding for subsequent trade studies and eventual capital purchase.\n Now for my question: I'm a little turned off by Cisco's extremely high prices, the complexity of their feature licensing, and also their super long lead times right now. I have positive impressions towards Juniper and Extreme gear, though my experience with them is limited. Given the relative simplicity of this network, I've wondered if I could get by using Ubiquiti or Mikrotik, but ultimately I think we'll want a paid support option.

But it has only 4x100G ports, which is not sufficient. So we started to look to other options:\n Cisco NCS55A1-24H - it has 24x100G, but limited scale - supports only ~2.2millions of prefixes. The maximum could be reached in a few next years. So this is not very good. Filter all /24 prefixes would be a workaround for future, but it could bring some new un expected problems, so we're looking very carefully to this.\n Cisco NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S - It has 36x100G with Extended scale for prefixes - support 4millions of prefixes, but seems too expensive.\n Maybe you know so other models would be not so expensive as NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S ?

          "description": "Hello\n I have some networking knowledge and experience, but I am still growing my skills and advancing my career. \n I was thinking about how layer 3 switching for interVLAN routing is more efficient and quicker due to the ASICs and such for routing traffic between VLANs compared to a standard firewall with inspection and such. But layer 3 switching ACLs are very basic and doesn't allow any sort of traffic inspection/analysis. \n Firewalls have all the great security features for traffic inspection and analysis, but can the bottleneck/slower for interVLAN routing to internal systems.\n One scenario I can think of is; lets say you have a media department (10+ people) that works with a lot of large files and directly edits off a network share through a 10gb link connected to their desktops. Using a firewall to separate the server network and their desktop network (as well as all the other standard user networks) may be the bottleneck when it comes to those connections but more secure for internal threats. Layer 3 switching would be faster, but way less security to defend against internal threats as well as more complicated to maintain with ACLs the larger the distribution layer grows. Or is this just a money problem and a beefier firewall should be purchased to handle something like this?\n I guess the question is, at what point do you choose firewall or layer 3 switch for interVLAN routing and ensuring the network is properly secure and why?\n    submitted by    /u/clifford641  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have a DHCP server which distributes the IP addresses. Sometimes computers just don't get an IP address and they get a default IP and are not in the domain because they can't find the DNS and DHCP server. The workaround is when you unplug the network cable and plug it back in or turn the PC off and on again. Both does not always work and you have to test which variant works. Of the 250 computers, not always the same computers are affected, but different ones. Now my consideration is to give each computer a fixed IP address, there is otherwise no solution.

We've been using the CSV tool within the Configuration piece in the GUI and importing static tags with the format <mac addr>, <policy-tag>, <site-tag>, <rf-tag>. After we upload the CSV and point the APs to the 9800, they come up perfectly as designed.\n ​\n As we look to move wider chunks of APs, I want to make sure this work is done in advance of moving the APs. Cisco has said there is no way to dump all this IF the AP is not actively on the controller. This doesn't sound right since it's stored somewhere in the controller for when the AP does eventually join. Does anyone know of a way via CLI/GUI/API to dump these \"staged\" static tags?\n ​\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/rocknsock316  \n [link]   [comments]",

The buildings have fiber, but they want a redundant link to avoid downtime. Apparently there's some upcoming construction and the boss is worried the fiber may get accidentally get cut in construction. \n I've installed the Ubiquiti Power beam on each building and connected each end to a Cisco switch. I am using the PoE injectors. \n In the testing phase, the PtP is working fine. The warehouse end comes out of a trunk port on the Cisco Switch, go through a PoE injector, then wireless goes across the parking lot to the admin building and then comes through another PoE injector. \n If you plug a laptop straight to the injector, it joins you to the LAN. If you put an unmanaged switch on the injector, and then plug in, you're on the LAN. \n But if you run the injector into the second switch, it doesn't go anywhere. The CLI doesn't even show the port (port 2) as active. \n What am I missing? I have full access to the switches, but I don't really have a good background of Cisco Training.\n Ideally, I'd like both links to be active, so if the fiber broke, the PtP would keep everything online, and I believe STP would prevent a loop, if activated. \n If all else fails, it's fine if the PtP stays unplugged from the switch until actually needed. \n I've tested it both with the fiber plugged and unplugged, and it does not make a difference.\n    submitted by    /u/Ezra611  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm not entirely understanding what the best practice is for managing VLANs, subnets, and broadcast domains is when designing an enterprise LAN. \n Here's a basic LAN segment to reference throughout this post.\n Across an organization, let's assume that at that a small size site with a single switch has VLAN 69 specified for interfaces connecting to PCs. \n At a larger site, there will be multiple switches connecting to a central core switch (or switch cluster), which then connected upstream to a router (router-on-a-stick). If I deploy VLAN 69 on both of the access switches, despite them being in different subnets, the trunk links connecting the access switches to the core switch will expand my broadcast domain to include both of these networks. The L3 traffic will be contained to whatever the mask is set to (in this case, the two /24s as shown in the diagram), but the L2 traffic will include all three switches and the LAN-facing router interface. \n Q: Is it possible to keep the broadcast domain limited to the scope of only the respective /24 networks without having to specify two separate VLAN IDs, or do I have to make one of the switches operate on a different VLAN ID? \n If separate VLAN IDs are required, how do you best design your VLAN deployments? Do you have ranges of VLAN IDs for specific purposes (i.e. VLAN 60-69 for PCs, VLAN 70-79 for Servers, etc.)?\n    submitted by    /u/EyeDewBrowse  \n [link]   [comments]",

The students and professor are complaining about the wifi. \n The distribution of clients heavily favors 2 APs. One 5Ghz radio had 35; the other had 30. Other APs in the area had 0-10 clients. I have tried adjusting the power levels and will do further tests to try to determine why so many APs are favoring 1-2 5GHz radios when there are 4+ more to choose from in the immediate area. \n This lecture hall has tables for each row so the clients aren't as densely packed as you're imagining and the APs are evenly distributed overhead. The only way to fit ~100 people in this room is to have an even distribution of bodies in seats. I think that rules out favoring 1-2 radios based on proximity. But I'm no expert\n Load balancing is not enabled on the controller. Does anyone have experience with this feature? I can't find much information on it aside from Cisco saying it will totally work. \n We do have band-select enabled and that appears to be working.

Can see the internet, can ping other VLans. Routing is working fine, DHCP to a new test Server is working fine, and DNS is working fine. \n The issue is that on the core switch we're getting that error %IP-4-DUPADDR: Duplicate address which is seeing the downlink interface MAC as assigned to the Gateway IP for the Meraki Management VLan, but that Gateway IP is also assigned to the SVI on the Core Switch (Cisco 4500x). \n You can easily see this by either pinging outside from the Windows Server (Google DNS is the main test IP), but it's the same from the Windows Server to the 4500x (Pure Storage -> Nexus -> 4500x). But pinging from the 4500x to the ASA it fails not at all. \n I believe that by removing BDPU Guard on the 2960S downlink interface so I could attach the Meraki I should also enable Root Guard on the Meraki to allow BDPU frames to flow down and to not have the Meraki think the uplink interface is the root bridge in its little STP brain. \n Any assistance would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/GreenChileEnchiladas  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ever since the change, we've had persistent bandwidth issues. Upload is pitiful, download is meh on what's supposed to be 200 symmetrical. I spent way too much time this week digging through firewall configs, running iperf tests throughout the network, checkin MTU size, cables, and generally tearing our network apart while the ISP was unresponsive. \n I tested multiple devices of different brands isolated on the direct connection, all capable of pulling gigabit+, and all pulled 60 max. Configured the firewalls to be glorified routers, both still pulled pitiful speeds. \n I was running a tracert during this diagnosis and saw an interesting IP in there... our old gateway for the previous static pool we had. But the firewalls and routers I tested on the connection all had the new IP and gateway set. On each, packets hit the router, hit the old gateway ip, then went on their way. All show the new public static. \n I'm not sure if that's the cause of the bandwidth issues we're having (though I believe I've conclusively ruled out anything on our end causing it unless like 6 different routers/firewalls with no extra configs have the same issue). \n Anyone seen an ISP route you through the wrong gateway regardless of the config on your end?

          "description": "So we have been having issues with a switch we recently put into place in a building on our base. The setup is as follows....\n Core switch > 3850 fiber switch > 3560 access switch\n With this setup, we have been having some problems and we believe they are related to AAA. Our AAA server is ISE and it is doing TACACS as well as RADIUS and MAB for clients.\n The failures seem to be intermittent, but basically out of 4 clients, only 2 of them will authenticate. The other 2 are not failing authentication, but the MACs are also not showing up anywhere. Its like they aren't even there, even though the interface is up. The 2 devices will briefly be put into the correct VLAN, but then after a minute or so, they go back into our \"black hole\" vlan, and nothing about them shows up in the switch logs or ISE logs. \n So my question is, could the issue be the fact that we are daisy chaining the 3560 and not going directly to our core switch? My boss seems to think that a setup like this is not how networking should be done. I do agree that it probably is not best practice, but I feel like the issue would be more so if the 3850 switch can handle the load of traffic going over it. Would there be any special type of configuration that needs done with a setup like this, besides just configuring a normal trunk port?\n Another thing that just popped up is we noticed that we have \"switchport block unicast\" on the trunk ports. We referenced another network that we managed and on that network, we only have that command on the access ports. Could that possibly be causing the inconsistent authentication errors?\n    submitted by    /u/Nats_daddy  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have a small network with a file server, Unifi edgerouter and UAP 2.4/5 access point. Because of the nature of the nonprofit's work, specialists need to bring their work laptops in and out and switch rooms frequently, and so hardwiring really isn't an option. Recently, users have been getting disconnected from the wifi intermittently in the afternoons between about 2 and 4. I added a second AP to a corner of the office where a lot of interruptions were reported, but it hasn't seemed to help. I've tried different channels, as it is a crowded environment, but no luck, and the APs automatically choose channels in normal operation anyway). I've confirmed that it isn't an issue with the network itself; hardwired devices work fine, and network activity appears normal. The issue is disconnection from the access points. I've spoken to several of our neighbors; a next-door neighbor reports the same thing, the one on the other side doesn't. \n I'm wondering if there's some kind of RF interference that's causing this, but I'm at a loss as to how to track it down. The issue of whether it's a 2.4ghz vs 5ghz issue is a bit murky to me, since (as is common) the two bands share the same SSID, so it's difficult to know which one a device is connecting to.

Just the username authentication failures. \n When we look at ISE, we do not see the authentication failures, all we see are the successful authentications. So that tells me that when we are having the authentication issues, we some how are losing connection to ISE because these failures are not shown. \n We are also using ISE for RADIUS and doing client authentication with MAB. Clients are also losing their authentication intermittently. Same thing though, this failure is not shown on ISE.\n This issue only occurs with the switch that is \"daisy chained\" and not directly connected to the core. And again, nothing in the logs indicating a loss with the ISE server.\n Does anyone have any idea what could be the issue? We are on a webex with TAC at the moment, but seem to not be getting anywhere. My assumption is that the daisy chained switch is some how losing connection to ISE, but again not seeing any logs indicating this. Connection to the switch is not an issue, because like I said , when this issue occurs, I can still reach the switch and login with the local account.\n    submitted by    /u/Nats_daddy  \n [link]   [comments]",

But when plugging it into the router, it does not work. We tried 6 different routers, from home ones to business ones. We tried to check for any policies with the IT team and everything is alright. We've used the same switch for diff. companies and it worked fine. In fact, we have the same exact setup at a diff. location and it works just fine. The connection is through a microwave link. We've tried to add multiple public IPs, and extend but nothing worked. We contacted our main provider and they said the issue is not from their side (their customer service is non existent) we have 48 hours before the customer cancels their service. the only solution i can think of is to use the server as a router but obv there's a deeper issue.

Also the VXLAN tunnels seems to be up, with the command \"sh int vxlan 1\" i can see the other vtep-peer IP adn MAC address on the other side of the topology. I'm going through the process following guides and the official Aruba documentation https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.07/PDF/5200-7890.pdf\n Onto the switches which are vteps i've created vlan 50 and associated it to vni 100. Then i went on the interfaces where i have VirtualPCs attached, i put them in \"no routing\" and then into \"vlan access 50\" (obv i enter \"no shutdown\" command). So this is only L2 configuration, no routing interested here. I gave ip addresses to the vpcs 172.16.0.10/24 and 172.16.0.15 /24. They're in the same subnet but CANNOT ping, giving me \"host not reachable\" as feedback.\n I replicated the vlan configuration on Aruba CX 10.04.0001 version (which NOT support vxlan interfaces) and worked, the vpcs can ping each other.\n Is this a bug for the Aruba CX Virtual 10.07.0004 version or i have misconfigured something?

Cost isn't an issue as it's fake and the budget is almost irrelevant, just need to justify the design. \n I'm in a networking course and part of the class is to design a medium-sized business network.

So I apologize for this low level question but I have 0 real-world experience. The assignment specifies cat5e.\n My question is, when running the cat5e cables out, is there a standard number of cables per destination (to rooms, workstations, etc.), or should it be exactly as many as needed? Is it 1:1 end component per cable (like if a room is expected to have 5 PCs, should there be 5 cat5s, extra? twice as many?)?\n I've tried googling this and watched videos of people but I still haven't figured out a specific answer.

Reboot is the only way to get it to respond. Disabling VXLAN fixes the issue. \n We emailed the account manager and she got someone involved ASAP, they didn't even ask for any logs or TSRs and said it was a memory leak and sent us a new firmware that fixed the problem, \n The fact of the matter is I've seen and heard of similar issues with Cisco switches, and routers that cost a lot more, what are your thoughts on this? \n Personally, I don't think I will use this for prod or dev, and hope I can convince management to give me one so I can use it in my home lab :D.\n    submitted by    /u/LucidZulu  \n [link]   [comments]",

Guy in remote office was moving furniture and not only found an 8 port cisco switch plugged in (not documented by people before me) but unplugged the POE on the bridge.

I want to blame this old cisco SG250 switch, which I looked up and shows STP on out of the box.

I want to be sure I am understanding what the configuration means, and I'm not just continuing to copy what I see just because it works. I do understand how vlans and tagging work for forward traffic and separate it between different subnets. Something \"tagged\" for a vlan I understand fine. But when doing a show run on an HP switch, I am seeing the labels \"no untagged\" and \"untagged\" listed, and that is throwing me off. \n When I see the words \"no untagged\" it makes me think that a port that is untagged cannot be part of this vlan (therefore only tagged ports can go here), and untagged means they are not part of that vlan. But then again, why would anyone need to specify a port is untagged? Wouldn't it be implied it is untagged on that vlan unless it is manually tagged?\n Below is an example (keep in mind, I didn't set these up):\n vlan 1\n name \"DEFAULT_VLAN\"\n no untagged 1-22,25-52\n untagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 5\n name \"MGMT\"\n tagged 23-24\n exit\n vlan 9\n name \"PC\"\n untagged 1-2,4-10,12-15,18-22,26-40\n tagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 10\n name \"DATA\"\n untagged 3,11,16-17,25,41-52\n tagged 1,23-24,28-40\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 11\n name \"VOICE\"\n tagged 1,23-24,26-40\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 12\n name \"SecWIFI\"\n tagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 13\n name \"GuestWIFI\"\n tagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n    submitted by    /u/This_guy_works  \n [link]   [comments]",

Initially I noticed there were a lot of CRC errors on the interface so we changed the cable which seemed to sort the problem. Now though, we have the same error again on the AP portal saying that the AP is unable to reach the cloud. I did a shut/no shut on the interface (which worked prior to changing the cable) but that hasn't helped. The MAC address isn't detected on the port to which it's connected (Cisco switch) and I've tried pinging the but the interface was showing as up/up.\n I then noticed that the speed was 100Mb/s. I've changed that to 1000Mb/s but now the interface is showing as down/down and a shut/no shut isn't bringing it up. All metrics on the interface look fine and nothing at all has changed in terms of configuration. Anything I have missed?\n    submitted by    /u/hbk990  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've even tried a win10 laptop, gave it the same IP and i'm not able to get to it thru vpn as well. gave it a different one and it's good! \n As far as path goes, vpn -> fw-> core -> access switch-> box. the 10.9.9.x network is L2. i'm not a linux guy so i'm not sure if there's an internal (i doubt it because i have access to it on-prem). i'm clearly missing something here. fw rule, routing, something.\n    submitted by    /u/d3adbor3d2  \n [link]   [comments]",

I apologize if I don't word things correctly when trying to explain this, but honestly the most I've done on phones has been static configs and configuring switchports for VoIP VLANs. This rollout we have ESXi, VMs, we're configuring Option 150 on a server, and I need to figure out where to point the ip-helper for the VoIP VLANs (there are about 12 but they should all point to the same whatever will be acting as the DHCP server; my problem is I don't know what that is. On the last setup it was the CME on a Cisco 3925 router. (Sorry if I didn't word that correctly.) I was told specifically by the vendor (Presidio) that it would not point to the router this time, but she didn't know where to point it either. I'm looking for suggestions and your experience in helping me answer the question of where to direct my ip-helper on my VoIP VLAN configs. Our server admin says he configured our internal DHCP scope on a server (on a server VLAN and not a VoIP VLAN, and don't internal DHCP scopes only assign to to those in it's own subnet? ) but the only time I’ve heard of internal DHCP has been for wireless so that doesn’t sound right. I know it’s supposed to be a L3 device but if it’s not the router, then I’m lost again.\n    submitted by    /u/UnitedWolverine5501  \n [link]   [comments]",

Keep in mind I'm a junior sysadmin at best so I'll try to include all the needed details while keeping them sanitized. \n Quick run down: I have a ipsec site to site vpn between two networks with 1Gb duplex connections through two pfsense 7000 series firewall appliances. Connection is stable however iperf only shows a bandwidth of 68 Mbps with transfer capping out at 8.50 MBytes from two hyper-v vm on either side of the tunnel. File transfers from local to remote site are also very slow at 20Mbps. While these speeds may work for my use case temporarily I can't help but feel I am missing something to speed this connection up.\n Steps I have taken to attempt to speed this up:\n Set MSS clamping to 1396 after calculating my OMSS. Sniffed before and after the changes and it fixed a fragmentation issue but speeds are unchanged. Using UDP over IPv4 for tunnel.\n Ensure there was no duplex mismatch on any NIC and no traffic shaping is in place.\n CPU's are mostly idle and a combined usage of less then 15%\n Asynchronous Cryptography is on, compression is off, no rules conflict with traffic.\n Any thoughts?

I've watched the airheads youtube series about AOS-CX which was very helpful, and I have been scrolling through the 1900 page manual, but I am not sure if I got it right. \n I am trying to use MSTP, have my client access ports configured as admin-edge with bpdu-guard and loop-guard enabled. In my example config the first 10 ports are configured for wireless access points, the next 10 for clients, and the last 4 are for links to other switches, and to the firewall. \n When I connect an older 2530 switch to port 1/1/24 I'm getting STP issues and the 2530 disables the port. \n I do not have a config to compare mine to, or anyone at all to ask. Did I get this right or did I make some rookie mistakes? The VLANs are not the issue, I'm not completely new to networking, its just the MSTP that I'm struggling to understand. \n According to what I learned I should not have to enable bpdu or loop guard on the uplinks, but only on client access ports? Does this include APs? \n ​\n Any videos/info about MSTP in AOS-CX would be very helpful. \n !Version ArubaOS-CX PL.10.10.1010 !export-password: default hostname LAB-SW6000 vlan 1 vlan 202 name MGMT vlan 203 name LAN vlan 204 name WLAN CLIENTS vlan 205 name WLAN PUBLIC spanning-tree interface 1/1/1-1/1/10 description ACCESSPOINTS no shutdown vlan trunk native 202 vlan trunk allowed 202,204-205 spanning-tree loop-guard interface 1/1/11-1/1/20 description CLIENTS no shutdown vlan access 203 spanning-tree bpdu-guard spanning-tree loop-guard spanning-tree port-type admin-edge loop-protect vlan 203 interface 1/1/21 description INTERNET no shutdown vlan trunk native 202 vlan trunk allowed all interface 1/1/22-1/1/24 description RESERVED UPLINKS shutdown vlan trunk native 202 vlan trunk allowed all interface vlan 1 ip dhcp interface vlan 202 ip address 10.100.2.51/24 ! https-server vrf default \n    submitted by    /u/SuccotashOk960  \n [link]   [comments]",

But which? 192.168.0.50 or 192.168.0.150?\n I have read different recommendations so far, from definitely inside, definitely outside to never mind.\n Sometimes I stumble over devices that don't even allow a reservation outside the pool.\n That's also why I've always defined reservations within the scope and only really fixed IPs outside of it.\n On the other hand, the pfSense Docs says:\n  \nISC dhcpd only checks via ping to ensure that an IP is not actively in use when making assignments.Making a static mapping does not “reserve” that IP out of the pool.The static mapping in this case merely represents a preference for an IP and others are not prevented from taking the IP if it is not in use. \n (...) \n As such, it is best to only make assignments outside the range/pool, and the GUI enforces this practice.\n  \nSo how it the right way to do it?\n Thanks and greetings,\n Martin\n    submitted by    /u/mfessl  \n [link]   [comments]",

SPLUNK will be used to log everything from clients, servers, network devices, and whatever else. It is currently setup and running, but not currently collecting anything from out network devices. \n For our syslog, we currently use Solar Winds Kiwi Syslog and that collects the data from all of our devices. My understanding with SPLUNK is that we set up a forwarder and the forwarder takes all the logs the Kiwi collects and forwards them to SPLUNK.\n Our department director is tired or waiting on the contractors to figure things out, so we he wants us to start configuring SPLUNK. He stated that he thinks SPLUNK has modules or packages you can setup that are made for Cisco devices which should make it easy to setup.\n What is the best way to go about setting this up? Is using a forwarder the right way to go about doing this? And if that's the case, do I still need to setup some type of module on SPLUNK for cisco devices? Or do I just forward the logs and analyze them that way? I was told to figure out what devices I need data collected from, but we already have kiwi collecting logs from all devices, so was thinking that those logs could just be forwarded as a whole. I didn't think I would have to install modules for each device that I want to collect date from. \n I have zero experience with splunk, so just looking to get pointed in the right direction.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Nats_daddy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Surely they haven't enabled DoH on their DNS servers and created a bypass for their own product?\n Edit: disabling Secure DNS via Group Policy for corporate users is definitely a possibility.

We have a network change/design opportunity and I am wanting to eliminate some route redistribution between OSPF and BGP. We use BGP for WAN routers to some of our sites around the state. We have remote connectivity from all around our state via our private fiber network, DMVPN tunnels (iWAN), and various peerings with Telco providers. We do this via 2 different data centers where we peer with different Telco routers via BGP, Cisco's iWAN, and our statewide aggregation routers that connect to our private fiber network across the state. The fiber network continues to grow as we lay more and more down each year. We bring those BGP routes into OSPF via route maps that have prefix lists attached to them. I wanted to go more into BGP and stop the route redistribution wherever I can. \n I am wondering if I should use BGP community values or route tags to allow our sites all around the state to determine what the best path to take would be. Basically every one of our remote locations have several methods of communication back to the data centers. I would like to make one path look better, and fail over, or be able to easily switch paths by changing a route map somewhere centrally to our data center. So if I change a value of a community string or route tag, all the sites switch paths at the same time, should I decide that needs to happen. Am I going down the right path here? Are route tags the best way to do this, or are community values the standard way to do this?\n    submitted by    /u/bardsleyb  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have figured a lot out by Googling and watching videos but I can’t seem to find this exact scenario that I am trying to recreate. \n I am wondering if I can just setup the DHCP scope, set the network inside of Unifi with the new IP range and point the DHCP relay to the firewall without using VLAN or if I need to use VLAN how I can get it to function properly across the network.\n Do I have to create a VLAN in the Sophos for this or do I just need to tag the firewall and point the DHCP relay back to the server? Also the switches are Layer 3 which I honestly have never used personally. I have been reading up about them but still unclear how I can utilize the layer 3 in this situation. \n I hope my post doesn’t get locked this time for being low quality. I hardly ever ask anyone for help when trying to do stuff and figure it out on my own but this one has me over thinking everything.\n    submitted by    /u/Revolver034  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am designing a hypothetical network for a homework assignment. It is fairly simple thus far, but this question I have is proving more difficult to answer than I expected. I have watched networking educational videos, I've looked for sources, but it seems that my firewall implementation idea is somehow novel, though I am certain it is not. Or, perhaps it is such a dumb idea that it does not exist online. \n I want to segment my network. Simple enough. My idea was to use firewalls at the edge of each network segment (\"star\" topology central router leads to firewalls at each outgoing port for the various departments) for high security. \n Is this... Reasonable? I only seem to find network segmenting that simply uses switches, but with no firewall other than that which leads to the WAN or DMZ. Additionally, how would these firewalls generally be configured? I would imagine I could allow only the ports that are reasonable for that segment's network usage?\n Also, can I use application proxy gateways at the edge of network segments? Online sources imply that proxies should only be used at the outside edge of the LAN. I want one proxy for one department, but a different proxy for another. Each then accessing the central router of the star topology. \n TL;DR can firewalls be reasonably used as a security measure for multiple internal network segments? What might that look like for security purposes? Same question for application proxy gateways?\n    submitted by    /u/CreedyBabyBoi  \n [link]   [comments]",

The client will typically send 2-3 packets for any given chunk, but the server only ACKs the first packet. The client then retransmits the next two packets and then gets an ACK for each.

          "description": "EDIT:UPDATE-my question was answered and pointed in a better direction. Turns out I should have probably posted in a industrial automation sub. Thanks for the info. \n Are there switches on the market that support RSTP with multiple rings in a switch. I am a design engineer for a BAS manufacturer and the industry is migrating out of rs485 twisted pair to using RSTP compatible switches with a Ring topology to keep costs low on the networking side. For example do switches allow you to set a root and backup port for multiple rings or are you limited to one failover port per switch. I imagine there are a wide range of options based on cost but this would be in the area of 3-5 rings per switch at most for very large networks. \n To clarify the end goal is to move into An IP friendly physical layer that maintains the cost effectiveness of daisy chains while using ring topology to give a fail over route if the cable is ever damaged/or enough nodes fail we exceed 100m between devices that are online. \n The current direction looks like a small 8 port industrial switch per network but I grow curious if there could be cost benefit to a single switch 18/24/48 port that could have multiple networks on 1.\n    submitted by    /u/Knoon1148  \n [link]   [comments]",
