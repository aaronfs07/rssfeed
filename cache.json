          "description": "This is clearly a trail of thoughts about the transition and the opportunities (not) from helpdesk to junior/mid admin. I’m not looking for “the answer” just want to rant about it because I had enough!\n By this time, I believe it’s almost impossible to make it, no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, study or do things just to learn, either the companies or the “co-workers” trying to push back and pull you down.\n There’s clearly no way out of the hell of helpdesk and if they labeled you as a junior admin, you are just a glorified helpdesk with a global admin account to just reset password, formatting the workstations and update the god-damn antivirus or fixing the f*@#$ng printer!\n No matter what or how you study, pay for yourself online trainings or a Pluralsight or whatever, getting certified with new technologies, setting up a lab on your own, nothing matters as it seems.\n The companies want someone with 10years experience and be the one man show and pay him as a junior. The seniors “co-workers” just don’t want you to learn and mess around with their stuff even if you are doing it alright and actually helping them, even if you are hired to do system tasks, they throw you back on the helpdesk pit for the d2d, because “you are more experienced with that” and you'll endup doing something actual worth doing maybe once in a couple of weeks.\n And let me ask you, how should I be more experienced if you do not give me a proper task or a chance to learn and do some actual work on a corporate environment, even if I do correctly everything you ask so far no matter how big the task was?\n Is it too much to ask? Getting paid decent money and doing the work you suppose to do on the role they hired you?\n    submitted by    /u/Balr0gDooM  \n [link]   [comments]",

Funny story time:\n A client I really like helping (they really appreciate the work I do for them) rings up in a bit of a flap. \"i'm watching my emails disappearing in front of me, I think i've been hacked!\"\n I say \"OK, shut down and I'll check access logs\". I check access logs, nothing other than his mobile and their IP. OK, not that then.\n I ring him up and say turn your computer on and I'll have a look. Turns out he didn't turn his computer off, just closed Outlook. Whatever.\n I open up Outlook, and check his inbox. Sure enough, emails are disappearing really quickly!\n OK, maybe he's accidentally archived emails newer than 1 second or something? Nope, no archives.\n OK I check his deleted folder to see if they're going there, and there they are - only they're being deleted there too!!!\n I check another folder, WHOA! they're being deleted there as well!\n What about Online? SAME!!! OH CRAP!!!!!! I'm thinking quickly. What could it be???\n Maybe it's a rule? OK I'll check that. I open up the rules, and I struggle to do anything. It won't let me click.\n It's then that I notice that the tabs across the top are flashing as though someone's got tab pressed. So I call the customer, and say \"is something on your keyboard???\"\n He gives it a thump, and suddenly, emails stop deleting. It was his keyboard, the delete (and possibly Tab) key was stuck or are faulty.\n Overall, it wasn't a long time - about 20 minutes. But I feel like I only thought of the solution because of Silicon Valley:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDK8tMyCic\n Turns out, 15 folders and over 10,000 items got deleted. I know this, because my powershell script to restore them capped out at 10,000 cos I forgot to add -resultsize unlimited at the end...\n    submitted by    /u/Darthvander83  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's about 300 users with 4TB-ish of data and some overly critical public folder mailboxes as well. Ideal end state is a hybrid setup, as we do have some legacy servers that need SMTP access. In addition, inbound mail will still go through Mimecast prior to being delivered to EXO.\n Since we are a small team, we engaged with an MSP to provide a quote to do some of the migration. They provided a \"get your tenant configured to best practices and migrate data\" quote in the six figure range. That seems very high to me based on the scope of work provided. \n Those of you who have done this migration, is it six-figures difficult? Also is the use of BitTitan (or similar) really necessary or can the built in migration tools do the job just as well?

It's beyond thrash, as it would be more apt to call it malware.\n The amount of times I've had a tech veer off and start making unapproved changes to a production server are ridiculous.

No matter what position I'm in I seemingly can't escape this customer service mindset from management and its driving me insane. I don't care about their issues. I don't care about their whining. That's for helpdesk. I'm here to build infrastructure, improve security, and ensure five nines of uptime. I'm not putting on any sort of customer service persona. Put in a ticket to helpdesk, do not approach me personally.\n The kicker is that I'm actually a very nice person for an IT guy - I frequently go out with coworkers, go to almost all the company events, get coffee with users, etc, but the enforcement of customer service has gone so far to extend to my real personality. I hate it, I want to be nice and not view everyone as an annoyance but this mindset makes it impossible.\n Anyways, did I get into the wrong industry? If so, what's an industry where you don't have to deal with people, or listen to their whining? At this point I'm totally willing to change career paths so I can get my personality back.\n    submitted by    /u/42069420_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was in desktop support for a larger internal IT department for 3 years before this (total of 7 years including my first job there in helpdesk)\n Didn't touch intune/group policy/or another form of remote management previously. I was just on the but end of stick and kicked off images and did deskside support for workstations and hardware support for laptops.\n An opportunity came to me 6 months ago from my old boss who changed companies for a MSP and I became a \"Systems Administrator\" basically everything to do with remote workstation and application management with a bit of apple mdm in the mix also. Intune/group policy/PDQ/some PowerShell scripting/MDT/SCCM/remote application deployment and updates.\n This was everything I wanted to do in my last role but it went to the sysadmins to do and I had no access.\n When I started there was a senior guy who knew everything and was loads of help to escalate to. He has since resigned since a few weeks ago.\n So now me and the other new guy are on our own. The ticket queue keeps building up and there are dozens of tickets that neither of us have any idea how to fix. SLA's are ticking away and customers are expecting updates for ticketd that have been sitting in the same status for weeks\n Yes I'm getting my googling and actioning stuff, making mistakes and fixing things but everyday is completely miserable.

For patching we use a 3rd Party Patch Management solution (Matrix42 PatchManagement) which manages the new office versions.

We upgraded to server 2019 standard, installed QB DB Manager as we would normally. Soon as we did almost every day they tell us they can't switch to Multi-user mode. We can't find anything wrong, no errors reported by DB Manager, service is always running. We simply login, tell it to scan, accept the warning and it starts working. Maybe for a day, maybe for a few hours, maybe for a week. \n They can all get to the files just fine from the file share. When they choose multi user mode it doesn't work until we click the scan button again. We have several servers with DB manager installed but this one is the only one giving us a problem. Quickbooks support has no clue what's wrong. \n The only oddity that occurred, while we were running the both the SBS 2011 and the 2019 standard some users had issues getting to file shares, as in the connection just seemed very slow. All local lan GB switched. As soon as we cut over the 2019 to be DC and GC with all roles, that issue disappeared.

They recommended, that users should switch to the browser version of MS Teams, until a patch is available. I made all my users use the browser client after reading this article.\n Now I accidently found an article by Tony Redmond, in which he argues, that the vulnerability is not easily exploitable in the real world. He recommends not to switch to the browser version, and still use the desktop version of MS Teams.\n Microsoft itself doesn't think, that the vulnerability is critical, and has no priority of fixing the bug.\n So, did I overreact, when I advised my users to use the browser client?

To collect knowledge from people that are smarter than me.\n Surely some of you have gotten to a point, at which you struggled to solve a certain problem. I noticed, that I often find myself in such scenarios, with no idea on how to address the issue.\n Are there a single or more processes a sysadmin can go through, to solve problems? I am willing and eager to learn, but I cant seem to find the thing I'm looking for. I know that there is no single way to solve all problems, but surely there has to be some kind of approach, to determine what the issue is, right? \n I'll define what I would call a \"process\" using a problem, I've got to solve at the moment. \n I've got VoIP PBX that works like it should, with one exception: the FAX service.\n Since the PBX doesnt send faxes like the old way, it receives an incoming fax , converts the content into a mail and sends the mail to the recipient. This stopped working a few days ago. \n After a little search, I noticed that the mail server doesnt work anymore. The testmail results in an error message. So I changed it to a Google SMTP to check if the function still works, which it does. The testmail is send successfully, but someone never arrives. \n Is there a way to check why my testmail does not arrive, and if yes, how?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Artistic-Throat8754  \n [link]   [comments]",

Still cannot login as the MFA code isn't working.\n At this point my imagination is running wild and I'm assuming that it's been hacked and the MFA for my admin account has been reset to the hacker's phone. Other normal user accounts (non-MFA) are working. The data is still there, no encrypted files or anything else untoward seems to be going on.

All that I need is activity audit logging, MFA, and granular permissions. It's used maybe once a year for a month or so during investor rounds, which makes the price tag even more painful.\n While we have SharePoint, I keep SharePoint use to internal only because its confusing to people, permission management is a PITA with external users, and audit reporting is no easy feat. I also want that clear delineation to employees to understand internal and external. I am just saying this so that I am not asked why I don't just use SharePoint for this.\n Is there something missing that I don't understand between the definition of a \"data room\" and just normal cloud storage setup to share with external/guest users?\n If you go look at Citrix ShareFile, theres specifically a data room tier that drops you from unlimited storage to 5GB of storage, and costs $448 a MONTH. Why is that a thing??\n Thanks!\n ​\n Edit: Based on the comments explaining the differences, it seems like we may be using a data room when we don't really need one for our specific purposes. I'll evaluate the other options. Thank you for the clarification!\n    submitted by    /u/Future_Is_Cloud  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We use a Windows 2016 server to run print jobs for our ERP system. All printing is direct - no print servers/sharing involved.\n For the past year, it seems like about 50% of Microsoft's updates breaks our printers. The exact scenario is: post-update, about 90% of the printers will have been defaulted to duplex printing, and about 90% of the printers will be using the generic Microsoft printer driver. (Note that these two groups do not always overlap; sometimes a printer will still have the correct driver, but will have been changed to duplex printing, or vice-versa.) This is not printer or driver specific; it occurs across several different makes/models and drivers.\n Fixing it is a relatively simple, but frustrating process: Just go into each printer's \"Advanced > Printing Defaults...\" and disable duplex. Afterwards, both issues will be resolved.\n We attempted to resolve this with a simple bit of Powershell, set to run (as admin) on system startup:\n  $printers = Get-Printer foreach($printer in $printers){ Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode 'OneSided' } \n However, Set-PrinterConfiguration only works after the printer has been manually fixed. Otherwise, it generates the following error:\n  Set-PrintConfiguration : Could not access configuration information for the specified printer. At C:\\Scripts\\Set_SingleSidedPrinting.ps1:7 char:5 + Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode ... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (MSFT_PrinterConfiguration:ROOT/StandardCi...erConfiguration) [Set-PrintConfiguration], CimException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x80070002,Set-PrintConfiguration \n Very frustrating.

I'd be up at 7:00 am, I'd be scripting, I'd be documenting, I'd be on calls helping out people, I'd be helping teammates even if they didn't ask for it, I'd volunteer for tasks, I'd be working late or on the weekends trying to get something done or working the way I wanted it.\n Now? Fuck all that.\n I did that for years, and I'd see people getting promoted and then try to figure out what I did wrong. Or at the end of the year my review comes back with all 'meets', and just get the standard raise. At my third job, it hit me like a baseball in the nuts with a simple comment from another co-worker. \n \"Why, the boss didn't tell me to do it\"\n It's that simple. All your manager is interested in is that you getting done what he or she assigned to you. Spending 12 hours making sure that documentation is just right might get you a \"good job\" comment from the manager and might get you the recognization of being a good document writer but you know what a quick bullet list you did in 20 minutes will tick that task complete and that is what your manager is interested in\n After I got that concept through my head my life in IT became a cakewalk and more important my salary has tripled over the past 10 years (and pretty much no overtime). \n That's not to say I don't do anything extra. I spend a fair amount of time studying but I take a two-pronged approach. First, learn what is needed for the current job, the processes, the tech stack, the DBs etc. That is usually a month or two then, as I like to change jobs or get promoted every 2 or max 3 years I start studying for the job I want next. \n I no longer waste my time trying to be the go-getter, the superstar, or that person everyone goes to for the answers cause at the end of the day it's just a job and I'm going to get paid the same to write an amazing doc or a bulleted list.\n Also, remember the rule of 5.

Would there be any advantage to power loss data prevention by switching to the WD GOLD SSD with the power loss prevention feature? I have been looking for an excuse to move them over to SSDs, but only if it is a good safe guard against power loss.

          "description": "Hi guys,\n I have a mostly WFH job in IT which requires the occasional local onsite visit. However, recently my company have mentioned they want to potentially send me to a large city that is roughly 6 hours away (flying or driving, all travel is expensed) for a week out of every month for a project that’s expected to last a year or longer. \n Travel time are hours that go on the timesheet to make up my 40 hours for the week. A hotel and car will be provided. All work related expenses can be expensed if I provide a receipt. If driving my own car, I can expense the gas at .55c/km, which adds a nice small bump to my pay cheques.\n My main concern is that a quarter of my year will be spent away from home and family. I don’t have kids, only a girlfriend who would miss me being home but can deal with it. After a while, I don’t think I will really be able to enjoy my leisure time when the day is finished if I cannot go home to relax. \n It would be a decent learning experience but it’s experience I could get locally as well. I make under $60k CAD (~45k USD) in Ontario.\n I enjoy my job but feel they are asking a bit much of me. My boss implied that travel is part of the job but I feel that there needs to be additional monetary compensation.\n Do any of you guys receive compensation for this type of extended travel for long projects? What do you think should I be asking for? Is it just part of the job? \n Thanks in advance for any input.\n    submitted by    /u/EliteTurtle2468  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our 4 locations are basically small, gated cities. The big center has essentially the leadership (government), a medical clinic, a store, a school, and 70 residences. Nearby is the airport and aviation team. The other 3 remote locations are each about 10 homes and an office. Each center relies on a single internet connection for everything (houses, et al) at that location.\n We have an IT team of only 6, all at the central location. Our documentation is old, disorganized, and thus hard to go through and find what you need. I think we're making progress though.\n Computers are a mixed bag of domain computers and BYOD. Letting a tool scan the network has always given unwieldy results or so many results there's not a clue where to start.\n The issue is that we have no idea WHAT we're managing, and that needs to change. We've setup a trial of iDoit and had a go. It's a nice tool, but perhaps too manual. We have PRTG that can help, but it's got so many alarms from \"false\" devices found during the auto-scan.\n The question is...what are others using for inventory and documentation? I'm looking for a tool that can tell me what devices are where with what configuration. Hopefully, something that can schedule maintenance and show a change history.\n I've been googleing on and off for months, finding a lot of sales pitches and promises. Maybe a short trial, maybe not. I'm hoping that by asking here, perhaps the options can be twiddled down to a good couple instead of what I'm (not) finding.\n    submitted by    /u/QuimaxW  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now, only some of their chemistry tests auto-verify, so I know it's possible.

Obviously I'd have to talk to IT at some point but hoping to get some input here before I even bring it up (in case it's absolutely crazy).\n As a side note, their Cepheid (COVID instrument) is not interfaced to Cerner at all, so they're manually typing in the 100s of Flu/COVID/RSVs they get in a day and then having a 2nd tech do a clerical check, which is absolutely bananas for the volume they get.

          "description": "Hi all, I'm a hardware engineer at some company. We have a device we collect data with that spits data out to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi has compiled code on it that saves the data to its local files and sends these files back to a lab PC over a closed wifi network. None of these devices are connected to the internet.\n During our testing, we're using Matlab to perform our testing procedures. Our auxiliary hardware is all reliant on proprietary Matlab drivers.\n To send commands to the RPi, we currently use Matlab to make a system call to Putty, which SSH's into the RPi and executes local code on the RPi. We need to do this hundreds of times per test, and it currently takes a couple seconds per Putty call, so the time stacks up. To push/pull files off the RPi, we have Matlab make a system call to an SFTP server.\n My question is: how would you execute the commands on the RPi faster than making system calls to Putty? My scenario to test speed is to execute a copy file command from Matlab 20 times, and time the results. Number to beat is about 40 seconds for those 20 copies. I've tried using the Paramiko library in Python, but it was slower than Putty. I've also tried using a 3rd party Matlab plugin based around the Ganymede Java library, but there's some problem with keys on our model of Rpi, even when I manually try to add keys to the RPi. My next move is a Python library called ssh2-python, but I need to get Visual on the lab PC, which will take some time given our IT situation.\n I was also toying with the idea of using TCP sockets in either Python or C++, but I'm not really familiar with TCP. I'm not a network person, so I'm kind of blindly stumbling from potential solution to potential solution. Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/jlark92  \n [link]   [comments]",

You import and trust the root ca and every certificate signed by the intermediate should be trusted too.\n Well. That doesn’t work. If I, for example, check the certificate of google with MacOS Certificate Assistant, the whole chain of trust is visible. If I check my certificate, I only see the TLS cert and the assistant cries about the untrusted intermediate certificate.\n It looks like the chain between root and intermediate is broken. If read the Wikipedia article about x509 and the lead me to more questions. It looks like the certificate only contents some basic information about it’s ca (in my case the intermediate) like public key ,algorithm, etc. but no information about the root ca.

The files are necessary for the cases they're working, and the 115k items in their inventory account for 3 months worth of work. The file share will lag for up to a minute before loading on occasion.\n I don't have experience in this area, but I'm certain there has to be a better solution than this.\n What would you recommend?\n    submitted by    /u/minnesotarox  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n Our org is 100% Cloud - all in on O365. We use SharePoint for file management and many of our staff use the onedrive app to sync folders to their pc's. Twice this year (so far), users have deleted massive folders/files (10-50k files) because they wanted to get rid of the sync'd folder on their pc - when they should have simply stopped the sync in the onedrive app.\n As you can imagine, doing massive restores from the recycle bin is extremely time consuming and it's tricky restoring from our cloud backup provider as it's usually not the entire site that is deleted.\n I was hoping MS had a policy we could set to stop bulk deletions (max deletions at a time = 20 or something along those lines), but from what i read and what MS support tells me, the only way to stop these deletion is to remove 'delete' permissions from all of our permissions, except for a select few staff. This also appears to disable renames as well.\n Is that truly the only way to stop this from occurring? Are there any O365 SharePoint settings to stop deletions in general? \n Thanks for your input!\n    submitted by    /u/Someone_Says_Hello  \n [link]   [comments]",

Neither Adobe or my licensing provider has been able to provide a fix in over a month, and I'm at wits end.\n Edit: So fun fact, Adobe Sign doesn't come with Creative Cloud K-12 Shared Device licensing, so if an Adobe employee tells you otherwise, you call them a damn dirty liar.

If I close the Microsoft login prompt it works for a while then disconnects and asks the Microsoft login again...\n The Exchange autodiscover is correct and only pointing to itself but if I use Outlook's Automatic configuration tester it immediately asks me for a Microsoft login, then if I close that it correctly asks for the domain credentials and once I provide that it gets the correct on-premises autodiscover information.\n The only detail I can think of is that we have a 365 tenant with some of the same email accounts as on-premises but it's only for Microsoft Teams, Exchange online is not configured anywhere at all, it's not even licenced.\n I've tried adding the autodiscover xml to the Outlook registry but it makes no difference, it's like it always phones home to Outlook before trying the actual email server domain.\n Has anyone had this issue before?\n    submitted by    /u/thefpspower  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Happy Friday Sysadmins! Do you have any plans this weekend? If not, I might have something you can sink your teeth into... Number Matching in MS Authenticator. \n It's a feature which essentially rather than prompt a user for a \"yes/no\" \"approve/deny\" response on their phone, asks a user to enter a number into a prompt box. This effectively blocks an attacker from flooding their phone with MFA requests, fatiguing them into accepting, thinking it's something they've done wrong; because the user will never see the number and the attacker will instantly know that attack won't work.\n This feature went GA last week but some of you may have had it in preview for the last couple of months, it's pretty solid and I thoroughly recommend it. From a users perspective, it's no more effort than an old school SMS code, and a tiny bit more than hitting \"approve\"\n The only thing I dislike about it from a users perspective, is that I can no longer simply hit \"approve\" from my Apple watch.. so be mindful of that with your execs and managers, I guess..?\n My video talking about it, demoing it and showing you where the settings are in Azure AD can be found here:\n https://youtu.be/cjsViEclw1I\n Apologies for the croaky voice, I'm unwell but wanted to get my weekly video out there and keep up with helping the small community of followers I've been working with for the past couple of months.\n If anyone wants any help with this, hit me up!\n    submitted by    /u/mnealitpro  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now we have a terminal server which everyone logs into and uses. I want to prevent certain users from turning off the server by applying the specific group policy rule. From my memory, I think I did the right steps but just now I tested it and it didnt work. I did the following steps:\n  \nMove Terminal Server to OU 'Servers'\n Link GPO to 'Servers' with User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar > Remove and Prevent Access to the shutdown command activated. \n Link another GPO to 'Servers' with Computer Configuration\\ Administrative Templates\\ System\\ Group Policy\\Configure user Group Policy loopback processing mode activated.\n Set security group for both only allowing the Standard-User Group to apply the policy.\n gpupdate on terminal server\n  \nWhat I expect to happen is the machine reading the loopback policy on startup, however I'm not sure if I just prevented that using a security-group. Do I need to include the machine itself inside the security group? How is it different than using \"authenticated users\". \n After reading the loopback policy, the Server tries to read the user config policy but ignores it, because it is not a user. Now when a user logs into the machine, although not being inside the OU, the user reads the user configuration from the policy because loopback is applied and applies the policy, when the user is a member of the security group. \n I'm certain I made a mistake somewhere because otherwise it would work. \n ​\n Thanks for any help\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable_Onion318  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This was just a weird situation all around, and I just needed to rant about it for a bit. This happened about 2 weeks ago.\n In the middle of the IT department, there is a table with our primary printer. One day, randomly, there were cupcakes and a bag with a brand name on it (the bag also contained 2 handwritten cards directed to our director and CIO). I asked around, no one knew where they came from. My coworkers started eating the cupcakes, but I didn't because I had a bad feeling about them. You need a key fob to get into our building, we had never heard of the brand before, and no one saw the person who dropped them off.\n Fast forward a couple of hours. I'm in the restroom and so is the building's receptionist. \"How did you guys like your cupcakes?\" she asked. I looked at her, confused, and asked what she knew about them.\n \"Well, a guy came in and said they were for the IT department. I couldn't get ahold of anyone, so I just sent him back.\" Awkwardly, I told her none of us saw him and none of us knew who he was, either.\n \"Oh.\"\n Getting back to my desk, I tell my coworkers what I had learned. Some random vendor we've never dealt with before personally delivered cupcakes. Whatever, vendor wants you to buy their products. What upset me more is that our receptionist just let a random person into the building for really no reason. We're not government or anything like that, but why have key fobs for the doors if our receptionist is going to let just about anyone in?\n Apparently I was the only one freaked out by that - everyone else had a cupcake. Luckily, they were just regular cupcakes, but still. That did NOT sit well with me.\n Rant over.\n    submitted by    /u/TheGreatestJaggi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got a vulnerability warning in the Defender portal showing that 27 of my devices have OpenSSL installed and need to be updated. The part that's confusing me here is that I can find no trace of OpenSSL installed on these systems. The only place that it shows as installed is in the Defender portal. There's no trace of it in the Windows Registry, nothing in the system path, no services running, nothing in the installed apps list, etc. But Defender is going as far as pulling in different version numbers from somewhere. \n Any ideas on what's happening here? This is only showing on about half of my devices. All have been deployed through Intune. We don't do any sort of custom certificate management and I've sure never set up OpenSSL to be deployed, so I'm not sure where it's coming from as it isn't very consistent. Some of these devices were deployed months ago, one was freshly ran through autopilot earlier this week. \n Much thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction here.\n    submitted by    /u/ChunkyMooseKnuckle  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of us - fairly senior member of the team- became concerned about this and basically said:\n \"Well the whole point of MFA is you have a known password, and then a thing, and that thing is either a hardware token, or the MFA app - However if the app now stores passwords, doesn't that defeat the purpose of MFA?\"\n From my point of view, it would be way too much of a faux pas if Microsoft just hadn't thought of this, and with our phones being in Intune, they have to have a password, they likely have biometrics etc, so i cant see it being an issue?\n Also i just tried signing in with my work account to the password keeper part, and it wouldnt accept the details, as it needs to be a Microsoft account, not a Work or school account.\n Does anyone else have any views on this that would help me articulate clearly to my colleague why this wouldnt be a security issue?

          "description": "Hello\n I manage a server for an important site which is regularly the target for DDoS attacks etc. The site is occasionally sending out newsletters to subscribers. That server is hosted on Hetzner. Hetzner has been contacting me with abuse requests (AbusePhishing: SPAM/PHISH Complaint) that people have sent them and is now threatening to shut down the server. I had a look at those forwarded emails and I discovered that the Message-ID hashes cannot be found in my /var/log/mail* logs (I have enough logs to cover the timestamps that those emails have allegedly been sent from my server). The emails content contains the newsletter content from the site but also appends various Pfizer spam links and images. All other legit emails that the site has sent can very easily be found via grepping their Message-IDs in /var/log/mail*.\n Question: Is there a possibility that a malicious actor has subscribed to the site's newsletter, copy/pasted the email that was sent to them, polluted it with spam links, and reported this as an abuse to their provider, in hope that it'll reach Hetzner which will in turn threaten with shutting down the server?

They are on the clock the soon they enter the premises, and they have to be ready to start working asap. \n As a company, we have our internal courses for training purposes, and this includes almost every subject that touches the company, and some of those courses are mandatory, even for IT staff like me.\n However, having this type of messaging via wallpaper, seems overboard to me, and having to file requests to go before CAB, any GPO changes go to CAB no matter what the purpose is, for this is ludicrous.\n Time is better spent to educate the users with proper courses, not via a small text on the wallpaper, with horrible colours.\n ​\n So, my fellow professional Redditors, how would you approach this if it comes into your lap?

          "description": "Howdy! \n We have multiple servers that ~70 staff use daily that I would like to migrate to drive.google.com given the age of the equipment and the recent string of hard drive failures ... but after asking everyone to pair down to the current data versus legacy we still have many department folders that are over the 400,000 items/object limit \n Since a shared drive can contain a maximum of 400,000 items/objects ( including files, folders, and shortcuts) I'm not sure what to do ... also given the large quantity I'm concerned about how well the Google Drive for Desktop application will work (everyone uses macOS and some computers are 5 years old)\n Through discussion, staff have agreed they can split out the files they don't need constant access to e.g. an \"active archive file server website\" and could access via a different site/service or similar but I'm not sure what would be a good service to support split access and doesn't cost a fortune. Looked at Backblaze B2 but its not really built for that. Google cloud storage supports the idea of it but is expensive and still isn't really designed to be easily browsed like a filesystem. Certainly Dropbox or similar services could work well ... but we're duplicating systems and costs then which seems silly. Management suggested just start new on drive.google.com and keep running the legacy servers but that doesn't fix the issue of the old, failing equipment.\n In a perfect world there would be select folders that you would stream to Google Drive for Desktop and then others would only be available at drive.google.com but that doesn't seem possible like it once was in older versions? Thought about setting up a separate Google active-archive user that staff could login to but with 70 people and changing staff that seems cumbersome at best. \n Any suggestions?\n Thanks!\n -Adam\n    submitted by    /u/Hody-dody-tech  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have some domains with Gsuite+M365 and others that are just Gsuite and some just M365.\n Anyways the setup and configuration took me about 25 minutes, I set it all up myself and have all my sites / teams / mailboxes etc... all backed up now and I am saving a few hundred bucks a month which I will use now to setup some other compliance tools.\n I am still searching for a solution that has a faster and easier interface to run searches across multi-domains / platforms (Gsuite/M365), right now I use an expensive tool and its a pain in the bum for the queries, if anyone knows of a moderately priced solution like AFS I am interested.

There's no altnets in the area and leased lines are looking at £800/month which isn't really feasible.\n However, as this site will need to provide public and staff internet connectivity we will need decent bandwidth (say up to 80mbit download), so we're looking to use starlink to provide this.\n I was wondering if anyone here has used Starlink for this kind of fixed site job and had any information regarding reliability and ease of configuration?

You need to be vigilant and always looking for improvements.\n It's a human problem if your company hires humans you have shadow IT\n Decreasing friction and improving the relationship between the service provider (You) and users is the most effective way to minimize shadow IT\n You need to understand what exists where through mechanisms that can't be bypassed. Instead of importing your excel sheet of NetBIOS names into an asset inventory tool, scan all your IP ranges. You will be shocked by how much unknown stuff sits on your network.\n Tools like WDAC and App locker are great if your just starting to tackle the problem.\n Don't villainize your self by snapping at users you catch with shadow IT. Understand why it exists and what you can do provide an appropriate alternative.\n Because your always going to have Shadow IT take a risk based approach and tackle the stuff those poses the most danger even if it's easier to remove that weird app Janet in finance uses.\n Once you have a strong understanding of what's in your consistency explore more 'heavy handed' technologies like Network access control. You can use these technologies to mitigate while you solve the problem.\n    submitted by    /u/LucyEmerald  \n [link]   [comments]",

The provider gave two WAN schemes and were insistent upon having to use both for the service to work, referring to one group as the \"LAN\". I researched dedicated internet for some time and realized it is innately different than the usual internet service with shared pipes. \n This was months ago but am seeing more events of customers signing up for this and then passing the buck to IT and it only being a problem once the cutover happens and nothing works as expected. The last thing I remember in first example was the provider suggesting I set up my \"LAN\" with this public scheme and basically NAT traffic from one scheme to the other to show outbound coming from their \"WAN\" scheme. \n If not obvious already I feel I'm clearly missing something here: can anyone chime in on best practice to get this working as expected? Have set up countless networks and helped facilitate cutovers for businesses utilizing static WANs before, but this dedicated internet setup obviously involves more than just the WAN port config and bridge mode modem that had come to be the expectation.

If adding additional OUs (not removing any) - and a full import on the directory is performed on next sync cycle - will there be any outage or change expected for current users in 365?\n (Azure AD Connect -> Customize syncronization options -> Domain/OU Filtering -> Sync Selected Domains and Users -> Select all additional OUs)\n Being overly cautious, however figured it wouldn't hurt to hear from somebody who has done this also, for peace of mind.\n    submitted by    /u/impostersyndrome2022  \n [link]   [comments]",

The usual tools and logs always point to bad password. User always claims it’s entered properly. Users are mobile, and the problems seem to occur on boot or waking up. OS is Windows 10.\n My current theory is that these lovely (/s) USB docks may be delayed in registering to Windows and identifying keyboards. And in that delay possibly the password, while being typed, isn’t keying in all the characters. Netwrix lockout auditor, DC event logs, etc, never show logon events from any other workstation, so I don’t believe it’s anything malicious. Our helpdesk is done with the problem, so it’s a sysadmin issue now. \n My insane idea is to throw a keylogger on one of their laptops and capture what’s being typed when they have this issue. In order to see if I’m right about mistyped passwords being the culprit. Because I have a feeling if I call Microsoft, I’m going to be pissing away $500 and months of my time arguing with the level 1 crowd, and going nowhere. \n If anyone has any other ideas, I’m game. \n Sorry for the long post.\n    submitted by    /u/thegodfatherderecho  \n [link]   [comments]",

I realized I can't do the constant remote, the 13hs a day... I just can't. \n I'm an introvert, I like to think, strategize and implement. My background is in network security mostly and I like that a lot. I used that knowledge and some people skills to work selling equipment, and even though that is not what I love and where I thrive, I can do it if I need to. I quickly learn IT products and can explain how they work. \n I went to a trade school, studied engineering, dropped out, and went to business administration while working at Net. Sec. - I like the IT world, I'm passionate about security and privacy but I also like the processes and structures where I can create a place for teams in businesses can work and can have success in what they do. I always jokingly called myself the architect of my businesses because I can easily connect or relate all the software, systems, and processes to make sense of it for the business and find ways to leverage all of them. And now I realize that's kind of a career as well. \n I would like to do something with my business experience and I was thinking Enterprise Architecture could be something interesting. I don't want to go back to configure firewalls or anything really. I could sell, but I rather not. \n Has anyone of you jumped and moved laterally like me?

          "description": "I work for a financial company and about a year ago, our security team put a policy in place to forensically image every computer used by a previous employee. We use various cloud platforms to back up the important stuff, but they set this up to get every thing on the local machine “just in case” \n It is incredibly time consuming and in constant need of attention or process change due to OS updates or our MDM applying new policies, and that the software/devices perform very intermittently. \n We use Cellebrite digital collectors (MacQ) for our Mac and Windows computers. Apple is already more difficult to navigate with this, and we still cannot obtain full images from M1 macs. I run into constant issues with the software freezing/crashing and, without any issues, the image can take anywhere from 1-5 hours to complete, so coupled with these issues, I can spend days working on these and make very little progress. \n Since starting this work, I don’t believe even one file has ever been booted with an actual need to find something. \n I am having a hard time seeing exactly why we need to have these images. With all the systems in place to record an employee’s work and the machines activity, I just don’t see how booting these images up later can be too useful. When researching, it seems like I am in a pretty narrow use-case, and it seems like there would be better tools and documentation if this was a larger and needed operation. But, maybe it’s the standard and I just have to keep pushing to get this into a good flow. \n How does your org handle this?\n    submitted by    /u/Smokingrobot666  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is getting a bit too expensive, especially considering that we'd like to add another VM. From looking at the bill, it seems that the main cost is the Windows Server VM License cost. Aside from the cost, the setup is optimal for the owner of the business as all of the employees can login at once (2 max per VM) and the work is synced through the use of SyncThing.\n ​\n Is there a recommended alternative that we can switch to?

OIT, for some bizarre reason, does not provide project sponsors to students and you are expected to find one in a span of about two weeks. Yes you read that right - you need to find a project sponsor with a Capstone-level project lying around for you to complete on top of managing your established work schedule (we're a commuter school). This is obviously insane and thankfully they offer the option to do a research project instead and write about your findings.\n My problem is... I don't really know what to research. Specifically, our project needs to bring to light a problem in the world and how we can apply our knowledge to fixing that problem. My focus for my degree was on Network and Systems Administration. I know how networking equipment/the internet works, how AD works, some basic programming, took several business courses, and learned a bit about cybersecurity along the way.\n My original project idea was how IoT implementation can benefit businesses and the security risks with IoT devices. My advisor doesn't really like this idea and insists that it won't be a big enough topic to fill 350 hours of work for the next year. I worry she may be right, but she doesn't seem to be giving me any usable project ideas. \n Any idea what kind of research project could fit the bill?

I want to upgrade it to a version of Windows Server which won’t be EoS next year, I want to have minimal downtime and I don’t want to do an in-place upgrade. Also, there’s a lot of data. \n So I’m wondering what the most efficient way of doing this is. In the past for smaller sites I’ve removed the old server from the replication group, stood up a new VM and added to the group, kicked off replication and waited. I don’t want to do that this time though due to the amount of data. \n So do I stand up a new VM side-by-side with Server01, robocopy the data, then when I’m ready rename and change the IP of Server01 and put that IP and host name on the new VM? If this is best, do I need to exclude dfsrprivate?\n I’ve also considered adding the new VM to the replication group with a name like Server02 while Server01 is still in production. Then wait for replication to finish, then (overnight) rename, remove from group and power off Server01 and then rename Server02 ‘Server01’.

Option 26 to be presice.\n I added option 26 to our dhcp server, did a reboot on an end device, a forced release/renew, and the mtu ( checked with netsh interface ipv4 show subinterface showed the same default 1500\n from there I grabbed wireshark, grabbed a capture of the renewal, and the ack does show option 26 with the correct value.\n I've checked the logs within the client however there are no entries or evidence that windows knows what to do with this information.\n so, can you help me with a few questions: 1. why does windows not honour dhcp options, speicifcally option 26? and 2. how would you go about modifying the MTU for client devices?\n ty for taking the time and have a great weekend everyone :)\n    submitted by    /u/C-DomiNations  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I would be very greatful if more knowledgeable members of this community would help me find some puzzling answers regarding proper disk benchmarking.\n Here is what I have gathered so far:\n High queue with small block size based on median of files stored on the server usually 16KB-128KB\n Random not sequential read/write depending on read write stats in my case usually 95/5 read/write for web files and 80/20 for database. \n Fsync on, system memory (ram) cache disabled directly in apps used in my case database ( buffer in mysql disabled ), web server ( file logs disabled ), language parser (in case of php opcache file timestamps disabled, error log to file disabled ), any logging and monitoring apps disabled\n Block sector of disk during formatting anf filesystem is equal between tested drives.\n Fill system memory loaded to the 99% to make sure os especially linux doesn't use ram as cache for file operations. Swap file disabled.\n Also because duplicated files in linux are referenced not physically duplicated try to make unique files.\n Also always check extreme parameters like 100% read or write workload or test very small 1KB or 1GB to avoid lags when for example somebody decides to upload big file or put this file as a blob to the database. \n Analyze data in a statistical manner. When parameters are gradually increased look for linear or logarithmic spread of the results to ensure disk performance is predictable\n  \nIs there anything more to know when benchmarking disks to choose the optimal one ?\n \nI'm wondering if apps for automatic tests like webdriver io imitating concurrent users in not so random fashion should be used beside the usual fio and sysbench i use ?\n \nI know that linux filesystem is little different due to points I mentioned earlier, is there anything else worth knowing in this subject which may affect the results of benchmark disk ?\n \n    submitted by    /u/labratdream  \n [link]   [comments]",

Had him on the phone for about 10 minutes and said he didn’t need to be on the phone while I fix this so I would call him back. We hang up and I see him working on his computer (obviously I can’t work while he’s working). I message him twice - once on the app and again on Teams to say only one can work on the computer at a time - no response. An hour and a half passes before he says “sorry, let’s reschedule for tomorrow at 2”. I say fine and call him and 2PM the next day on Teams - rings once and stops. I figure he’s on a call and rejected my call or my call just didn’t go through so I message him - no answer. I was contemplating going upstairs to my main PC where my kid was (I was in the garage) but decided to stay to see if I could reach him. I call him again 10 minutes later and he says “meeting went over - 10 minutes?” This is when I hear my wife yelling my name because my baby fell from the bed about 2 and a half feet asking me if we should go to the hospital. The part that’s pissing me off is this end-user who #1 didn’t have the common sense or listen to me when I said I’m going to work on his PC and to leave his shit alone, #2 I’m trying to baby sit this end-user because he wasn’t courteous enough to give me a heads up that he was late earlier.

As this was 10 years ago, it may not be 100% what he said, but I think it's pretty close.\n troubleshooting FC:\n  \nhost (initiator) HBA driver\n host HBA status\n switch port for initiator\n cabling to initiator\n zoning connecting the initiator to target\n cabling to target\n port on target\n LUN to port mapping\n port security\n  \nStart with 1 and go to 9, for all things able to be checked remotely first, then check physical. 3-7 can be checked partially with one step, checking the switch to make sure they show links.

Their customers might be other businesses or private people. For example a bank that wants to provide the bank statements to their customers via such portal. Or a construction company that wants to provide technical drawings to their contractors. etc. \n ​\n The basic use case is more or less the same, though the industry varies. \n ​\n The platform would sit in between the consumer of the documents and our document management system. \n Most likely the communication between the platform and the DMS should be via REST API's.\n ​\n Do you know of any solution that might cover the basic or advanced requirements of such a \"portal\" ?\n ​\n I'm also considering building something with the M365 platform (PowerApps, Azure Functions, PowerAutomate, etc.)\n ​\n One of the solutions I'll be looking at will be https://www.deepbox.swiss/en/overview/\n ​\n Any ideas/suggestions are welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/--The_Cheshire_Cat--  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n At the request of the boss, I've been implementing PIM this week in time for an MSP switcheroo next week. \n I'm writing an email to explain how to request roles in response to 'we tried logging in and don't have access' from the new service desk but I'm having a bit of trouble with the test account I've put together to grab screenshots from - \n ​\n 1- Should I need to sign out/in for the role to become active? The PIM page says the page will refresh by itself, you don't need to sign out/in. \n I've been trying this for the past couple of hours, and I kept having to sign out/in because waiting 3-5 minutes was yielding no change - the 365 admin page and the ECP page were giving a 'no access sucker' unless I signed out/in.\n Meanwhile, after assigning direct access, then unassigning direct access, then trying again using PIM, it now HAS worked without signing out and in again. Is this the usual experience others have had, or have I just been particularly unlucky with propagation delays\n ​\n 2- The Exchange recipient administrator role in particular seems bad for this - I assign it and activate it on my test account, but it doesn't seem to do bugger all. I activate it, I sign out, sign in, do a little dance, and still don't have access to the ECP. \n Meanwhile, I assign it to be permanently active, sign out, sign in, BAM it's immediately there and works flawlessly. \n ​\n I've signed out and in to these accounts so many times I'm ready to sign out of existence entirely,I just want someone to confirm whether or not this is the experience other people have had or if I'm just having a particularly bad friday night. \n ​\n I'm gonna go make a cup of tea and cry into it while I wait to see if it's just been me all along\n    submitted by    /u/8ftmetalhead  \n [link]   [comments]",

I won't get into why we couldn't confirm that, it's a long story, but just go with it. \n The drives were pulled BUT I realize that we did not note down the exact slot each drive came from. We will need to pop them back in further down the road. My initial thought process was the RIAD controller should be smart enough to figure it out, but I am realizing that might not be the case and I may have made a grave mistake.\n Just wondering if there's any insight on whether or not the physical slot matters when it comes time to plug them back in. \n Thank you very much\n    submitted by    /u/Wittinator  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not only can the authentication options be changed only in the who knows how many years old control panel settings and not the modern settings app, but once you finish setting up the network, you can no longer modify some of the key attributes like which CA certificates to validate the radius server against!\n ​\n What. The. Hell. Microsoft.\n ​\n I swear, I don't usually get my jimmies rustled at work, but this...

Unless you remembered to change one tiny little option in the PEAP configuration, if someone was to impersonate an AP, even if they present a completely different and invalid server certificate, windows just displays a puny little dialog going something like \"Do you expect this network to be present here?\" along with a hyperlink option to display the radius certificate, and a pair of buttons - Connect / Cancel.\n ​\n No huge warning like in web browsers, if a page presents an invalid SSL cert, noooo. No 3-dialogs-deep exception confirmation option or secret keyboard phrases. \n ​\n A simple. Yes.

For example, let's say you have 100 Windows Servers and 10 Windows 10 clients and you have been tasked with installing a brand new backup solution that backs up files and folders via backup agents. You are creating the new backup job, and you have to decide which servers/clients get agents installed, and which server/client disks/folders you want to select as part of your backup jobs. Does IT just make an educated guess at what needs to be backed up? Does the business unit provide IT with a list of data sources (structured and unstructured) and IT works off of that? \n In our shop, IT decides what should be selected for backup on a daily basis knowing where actual company data lives. If it can't be recreated elsewhere, we back it up. If there is another source of that same data (and its current, then we skip it). For example, we do backup our home and shared folders, but we don't back up application installation folders.\n    submitted by    /u/jwckauman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey All, \n I have just started a new gig working in a 99% Terminal Services Environment with the vast majority of users working off Windows 7/10 HP Thin Clients connecting via RDS to Windows Server 2016. \n Users are logging into Thin Clients with Generic Auto Logins and then authenticate via RDC to their sessions. This is problematic for new users because you can't change your password from RDC, at least not without making the process overly complicated by disabling NLA Server Side and a convoluted process client side with first tie logins using a secondary RDC shortcut with CredSSP disabled.\n I haven't worked in a shop that has had this problem, formally I was the IT manager for a mid size org and our TS were connected to from Windows workstations so users were already authenticated.\n The IT Manager's process has been to assign users passwords in the past and set them to not expire. Then he would communicate the password to the user or manager for login. Obviously this is 1. Not Secure, 2. Cumbersome as hell. 3. Several points of failure. \n This has been made more ridiculous by the fact that about 6 months ago they brought an MSP onboard who is now handling \"some\" of the user onboarding process including creation of AD accounts and they use a temp password as they should. But, now new users can't login. And my understanding is that new users have just been hijacking others accounts to get to sessions, creating security issues, profiles issues etc. \n My understanding is that the RDP Web Portal will resolve this issue, but I am honestly not familiar with using it and wanted to see if anyone had any input before I go suggesting this as the solution to the org. \n My understanding is that Users would connect to the RDP Web Portal via a browser where they would authenticate for the first time and be able to reset their passwords, and from there they would have access to their Terminal Services Sessions, is this accurate?\n    submitted by    /u/TheBlackAllen  \n [link]   [comments]",

The hybrid key trust configuration is completed and basically it works flawless on all laptops. Though, on some desktops users cannot setup PIN due to error saying that this device do not meet WHfB requirements.\n Fun part is that if any other use sign-in to that desktops with his account, then the issue not exist anymore and they can set their PINs. So, despite of what the error says, I think it is some issue with specific users profile. I believe they tried setup Windows hello before the configuration was ready so something might be mixing here now.

          "description": "Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xcqz2r/solo_it_asked_to_do_engineering_work\n So a while back I, solo IT at my company, was asked to restructure the manufacturing processes in our companies manufacturing planning system (see original post for full story). As many pointed out, this fell entirely in the realm of industrial engineering.\n A few days ago I made the company an offer. I would help restructure their processes with the help of 3rd party consultants, but I will not work IT at the same time. So they'd have to choose what full time position they want me to be in.\n After consideration they decided today that they wanted me to work full time on reimplementing their manufacturing processes and it would be very clear to the rest of the company that I am no longer IT and should not be approached regarding regarding any IT issue moving forward. This will take effect in 1-2 weeks.\n I then asked, so how will IT be handled when I'm moved off? How will we hire someone in time to learn and manage all the IT processes? They said that end-users will have to step up their game and figure out how to troubleshoot their own issues.\n I'm very excited. Not only do I get to tell end users \"not my problem anymore\" when the inevitable storm hits from IT being torn away, Im also betting they last no more than 2 weeks tops before they pull me off engineering and beg me to get back to handling IT. We'll see how that conversation goes 😉\n    submitted by    /u/kangaroorider  \n [link]   [comments]",

Like Managers would be like \"so nice of Jerry to leave us hanging like this\". It made an enviroment where you NEVER wanted to take a sick day because you would be letting everyone down.\n ​\n Fast forward to now, I woke up the other day with fever and real bad sore throat. I sent an email to my boss saying I wasn't going to be in and he was totally fine with it. I still felt guilty, and tried coming in today since I felt a lot better, but everyone at work was just like \"nah go home, we don't want to catch whatever you had\", even when I went to tell my boss I was going home, he was totally cool with me taking today off as well.\n    submitted by    /u/voltagejim  \n [link]   [comments]",

At implementation time neither vendor would take responsibility for the integration. What they meant from the start is that it's possible to use ETL to connect the two. I had to build it. Now it's my baby and any time there's a problem with it, I have to fix it. I've got a baker's dozen babies at this point. Got an email from a manager the other day asking me to show him how to troubleshoot the solution that his department needs so that he doesn't have to wait for me to be free to fix it. I was seconds away from suggesting that he could prevent the problems proactively by hiring competent people who wouldn't fuck it up in the first place. I don't know where I'm going with this. It's just a pointless rant. The real solution is that I need to train my tiny little team on all these solutions so that we can support them as a team.

Recipient count around 1000-1500.\n Marketing wants to inform customers of upcoming trade fairs\n  \nI have just now learned about different email marketing software and that there is a difference between a marketing mail and a transactional mail. I am under the assumption that for use case 1) we should not use our own mail server since the high amount of mails might put us on a blacklist - is this correct?\n If yes and we need an external tool for this, would use case 1) count as a transactional mail? All recipients come from our CRM system and had direct contact to Sales at some point in the past.\n For use case 2) I'm pretty sure this counts as a marketing mail and requires recipients to opt-in first. This is fine for use case 2) but would not make much sense for use case 1) as getting all of our customers to sign up for price increase mails is unrealistic.\n I would appreciate some further input to guide me in the right direction.

During the deployment, I install a recent cumulative update which I downloaded from the microsoft catalog. This is a rudimentary way to have a windows deployment up to date when delivering it. After deployment, the sccm update system kicks in.\n The process of Bios firmware updates coming with Windows updates is detailed here:\n https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c07009542\n Strangely, I've never seen these bios firmware updates happen with updates pushed to clients over SCCM, even though the cumulative updates should be the same.\n Is anyone aware of a difference between cumulative updates pushed with SCCM and cumulative updates downloaded from the catalog, or of another process which might block bios firmware upgrades during the regular monthly update cycle?\n I don't necessarily dislike the update process over wsus if it takes care of bios passwords and bitlocker lockouts (which it seems to do) but I'd rather schedule it and inform the users if it would come in the regular monthly update cycle.\n The settings titled “Prompt for Admin authentication on Capsule Update” controls the password requirement for use with BIOS updates via UEFI Capsule.

          "description": "We're going to shortly refresh our fleet of remote laptops by resetting Windows, configuring them with Autopilot and enrolling them with Intune for management. We currently deploy devices with MDT and are able to specify that the drive is Bitlocker encrypted with the requirement to unlock being that the TPM is present and the user uses a PIN. It doesn't appear that this is possible with Autopilot - there's no built in mechanism during the Autopilot process to prompt a user to enter a pin that would then need to be used to unlock the drive when they power it on. Has anyone found a way to achieve this?\n This has raised the question whether the additional protection of a PIN (alongside the TPM) is necessary to secure our remote devices. If we BitLocker our drives using the TPM only as the requirement to unlock it then the data on it is protected if the drive is removed and plugged in to another machine. Additionally, if the device is lost/stolen then the user will need Windows credentials to log in to the laptop and access the data on it. If we couldn't find a way to dynamically add a pin to our remote devices, are there any things I'm missing by using this as a secure solution? \n We want our data to be secure on our remote devices and up until now BitLocker with a TPM and a Pin has been how we achieve that. I guess my question is whether our data on remote devices is still considered to be secure (in the eyes of the industry and best practice) if we encrypt our drives using TPM only as the mechanism to unlock it.\n    submitted by    /u/Donatello0592  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys,\n Someone offhandedly mentioned here that you could order dedicated Att business fiber in order for them help with the cost of running line/build out (they offer 10k budget) then switching to a significantly cheaper shared business fiber plan once the circuit was in place, is that really a thing? I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, \"The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term.\" Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don't need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. \n  \n Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place. Just not really sure if dedicated circuit can be repurposed for shared later on with a setup like ours. \n Thank for any insight\n    submitted by    /u/Ovulating_Oyster  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything you click on has a high latency.\n We have allready checked the performance monitor on the computers. The only thing that was noticable was that Teams consumpts arround 15 - 30 percent of CPU usage (for a 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 as an example). Neither the SSD, GPU, RAM or other components seem to have a higher workload. It´s just the CPU, but anyway it´s by far not at 100% workload.\n I googled arround and found out that this problem seems to be well known for many people but nobody seems to have a solution for it.\n ​\n Does anyone else encounter the same behaviour of Teams or maybe even have a few hints for us or a solution for the problem?\n ​\n Thank you in advance!\n ​\n ​\n Edit// I forgot to mention that all of our computers at least have a 10th or 11th gen i7 with 16GB RAM and a m.2 ssd. \n    submitted by    /u/Sam751  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I don’t feel like I’m respected or trusted to have the tools to do my job here. \n It’s gotten to the point where I’ve begun collecting evidence of my requests that go unanswered, so if I’m ever terminated I can prove I didn’t have what I needed to succeed. Do you think it’s better that I stick it out for another year for that job history/resume experience, or should I look to leave as I’m really no longer learning or able to work on progressing my career here? I am studying to take some cyber security certs to help pad the resume though.\n    submitted by    /u/LivingInTheWired  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "... and I am baffled that I did. I tell my clients all the time to be careful with suspicious mails. And I guess this time I wasn't careful enough. \n The original mail seemed to originate from their web hosting provider stating a new invoice was ready for download and contained an HTML file as an attachment which should be the invoice itself. It was forwarded twice within their org, then to me with a request for credentials to access that site since it prompted for them. The website was an absolute perfect replica of the genuine login site and prompted for credentials. I filled it out planing to download the invoice and send it to them, since I knew the sender didn't have them. However the login didn't work. After checking the url I was on the correct site of the provider. What I didn't notice at first: I only got redirected there after entering the credentials. For some reason I got suspicious at that point and checked the HTML file which contained some encrypted java script. Of course I immediately changed the password of the account and fortunately found no suspicious activity. \n However I am still in shock how stupidly I behaved.\n Edit: just to add, that Mail did not trigger any spam filter nor did opening the HTML file trigger the antivirus or the webfilter of our firewall.\n Edit 2: just uploaded the file to Virustotal and it seems it's actually a trojan. However it's still undetected by our antivirus solution. This file was first uploaded to Virustotal a week ago.\n    submitted by    /u/Bl4ckX_  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems to be a rather known issue that AD CS does not (sometimes?) clean up the ESE log files, for example:\n https://www.sysadmins.lv/blog-en/database-log-files-are-not-truncated-when-you-perform-a-full-certification-authority-database-backup.aspx\n The reference is contradicting itself. It says \"no workaround\" but also gives a command that \"identifies the start log file number to protect\". I had already figured out about as much by using esentutl but would like to confirm I am getting this right.\n In the above linked example all logs with sequence number smaller than 3B, meaning edb00001.log until edb0003B.log could be removed, right? What about edb.log, that one must not be touched? Or one cannot just delete any log file and have a working database?\n It should be rather simple to make a script that:\n  \nRun esentutl /mk edb.chk\n Parse the Checkpoint line for sequence ID\n Delete all edb#####.log files with ##### smaller than value from step 2\n  \nI have been searching for a while and could not find one website about actually doing this. Surely someone must have done this before, it does not even look that complicated?! Several hits for just brutely stopping certsvc and deleting all logs which is not what I want to do if this can be done \"right\", by just deleting unnecessary log files.\n I guess I could just download the whole CertLog and play around with it, see what happens.

So I made contact with the vendor who told me that the network guy needs to get his hands on the problem. The logs stated that also, at least the software ones. So I conceded and went back to troubleshoot even though I was pretty certain it´s not the network, most certainly not the server and probably not the software. It runs on several devices without any issues. \n After another sleepless night it dawned to me that the only difference is, that the software is installed on a HP desk. So I grabbed just another device, slapped the software on and it runs. It just does, what it´s supposed to do, it works. So it´s the HP trash again. Why? I don´t know. I wish I could say that every single HP device is in it´s own contained part of the network, isolated from the rest of the world and hidden from any tech guy but they are everywhere and the rules applied are the same as for all the other stuff. The one and only difference is, they are HP desks. \n I honestly don´t know who made the cost-benefit analysis or if there even is one, but I´d like to see which maniac decided to buy HP products.\n    submitted by    /u/Testnewbie  \n [link]   [comments]",

An upgrade of TM's client was complete or in progress at the time of the first presentation, which coupled with issue 2 made us conclude a botched update was the cause.\n Unfortunately repair didn't seem to work and TM's support suggested we proceed with a hard uninstall using their CUT program. The problem was this took an extremely long time (over a day in one notable case). We dug through the logs and discovered CUT was attempting dozens of tries with long timeouts for each operation, before eventually failing and moving to a more aggressive option (ie removing a service after failing to stop it).\n We discovered that an ini file was created upon launching the CUT executable and we could, if we were quick enough, replace that ini file with a modded one that reduced timeouts and # of attempts to something more manageable. This brought down removal time from hours to about 20 minutes per machine, which could be run in parallel.\n On some machines CUT would complete on first try, others would require a second application even though CUT logged its successful completion.\n After that we could reinstall the TM client with no further issue.\n TM support told us this has never happened before (when does it ever) and we're the only ones reporting it (what good luck), so I thought it'd be useful to put it here for anyone that should happen to suffer this issue or something similar.\n    submitted by    /u/senove2900  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a feeling that the previous image broke defender somehow since it included crowdstrike on the install, rather than installing after enrolling via autopilot in the new deployment.\n I’ve tried the commands I’ve found online to reset the app using AppX, re-registering it again using add-appx using the built in windows 10 manifest.xml, and resetting the app via “Windows Settings”. I’ve also tried restarting the Windows Defender service, modifying registry entries to enable “passive mode”, and simply enabling periodic scanning on the device itself. Windows defender seem to just won’t start at all. I checked group policy and Defender is not blocked.\n Any other ideas you guys may have to get defender running again?

I know I can get another admin or DevOps type job but I'm curious what is folks' thoughts on what will be new in-demand roles in IT in the coming years.\n I'm not talking about learning an app (for example Chef and building cookbooks) or generic stuff like automation (for example learning Python for scripting). I'm thinking like where will AI be or quantum computing and what kinds of roles there will be for the admins.\n Big industry-changing stuff like when Windows 95 came on the scene and the world hustled to move to distributed systems hiring anyone who could spell PC. Or when Amazon released commercial cloud computing and suddenly the \"cloud engineer\" title was the fat paycheck.\n Or maybe I just say screw it to cutting-edge tech and get a job supporting the Mainframe and COBOL? That stuff will be around long after I'm retired. Plus from what I see folks to support that is in very high demand.\n    submitted by    /u/testing_cock  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I'm looking for any advice on how to proceed with fixing it once and for all.\n Here's what I've looked into:\n  \nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Keyboard Layout\\Preload has correct number of keyboard layouts - the two I've set (00000409 and 00000419, English and russian) - as expected\n \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Keyboard Layout\\Preload has English only (00000409) - as expected\n \nIn settings > time and language > language I only have two languages selected, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected\n \npowershell's Get-WinUserLanguageList returns two languages, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected\n \n And yet, there are three keyboard layouts to select from in tray - being two I've selected and 1 extra called QAA, which is basically English.\n Logging out and back in again doesn't fix it. Rebooting doesn't fix it. The only way to fix it is to override current settings - either using powershell or manually resetting up all that. But problem appears again sooner or later - maybe next reboot or maybe 4 months in - appears to be random.\n Googling leads nowhere as all there either temporal fixes that I've mentioned or common useless advice like \"run sfc scannow\"\n Has anyone figured out how to get rid of that problem permanently?\n    submitted by    /u/xCharg  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, to account for all complex partnerships that could be in place, a unique namespace used as the target address will ensure free busy works properly.\n ​\n Note: The domain name “TailspinToys.com” is not present in any of the Organization Relationships in the Contoso environment.

We propose two main core switches, setup as VSS and aggregating approx. 70 access switches installed in different floors in the building communication rooms. Single stack contains 5 or 6 access switches with 10G uplinks to upstream core switches. Access are all L2, and we route between VLANs using SVIs on the core switches and some VLANs are firewalled for Guest and IoT devices.\n Pair of high specs firewalls connected to cores for perimeter (internet, wan & dmz) and internal segmentation (servers & end devices, depending on the use case and security controls requirements.\n Eventually, with regard to servers, we are thinking about having 3-tier network: access > distribution > main campus core\n Two distribution switches with Servers SVIs on them or Firewalls. \n L2 links terminated on Cores with Point-to-Point transit VLAN.

          "description": "I work at a university, and most staff that have IT issues seem to think they already know the answer, or just have general \"hmm I still think IT is at fault\" demeanour when you're giving an answer to their problem.\n I generally try to be really civil, but sometimes the answer to an issue is so glaringly obvious, and becomes a real waste of time have to go through all the rigmarole to prove that the problem is a user problem, not a system/network/IT problem, that I feel I need to be a bit more blunt and not worry too much about how I'm coming across.\n To give you an example, just recently I had person in senior management raise a ticket because an important document couldn't be found on SharePoint. The ticket was escalated to me, and after looking into it, it just looks like someone moved the doc into another folder (probably accidentally). The user was trying to access the file from a URL link, and when it didn't work (because the file was moved), they panicked and assumed IT had done something. When I told the user that the file was most likely moved, their response is still implying that IT had something to do with it, as no one in their team (over 10 people, all with edit access to the file) would have moved the file. I reiterated that it was probably an accident by someone in the team, and a fairly common and easily addressable mistake, but the user has now involved their manager, to make sure the problem doesn't happen again. It's now become a way bigger issue than it ever needed to be, all because someone just accidentally moved an important file, and the user just can't accept that this happened and it wasn't someone IT behind it.\n This is just a recent scenario. Issues like these seem to happen all the time, where frustrated users just don't believe what you're telling them and seem to just blame anything on either IT staff or systems that they don't understand, yet speak with authority on.\n Any advice?\n    submitted by    /u/PsyduckAF  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm in my mid-30s, right here when age discrimination starts becoming a real thing, and just want a stable company for the next 15 years. \n So the good news is the company is giving us 10 months severance plus 1 week's pay for every year and 6 months of insurance after we are let go.\n The bad news. When our director called us into the conference call to give the news he was very candid and probably told us more than he should have. Basically, it boils down to money, the business leaders found they can hire in Europe/UK for 60% of US wages. They can hire Indians for 20% of US wages. Australian wages were a wash with the US. They also decided it's cheaper to move the HQ to Ireland (with much lower corporate taxes) and import to the US. \n I work with folks from Ireland and UK every day and their work is every bit as good as what we do in the states. I'm not bashing their skills but more concerned if we, Americans with insane salaries, have priced ourselves out of the global market. The state I live in has an average income of $61k. I make $153k. I make this kind of money with no degrees, a couple of entry-level certs, and to be honest very little effort on my part. I just kind of have been the guy people get along with and every few years some past co-worker DMs me if I'm interested in a new job. \n Add in the sharp rise in remote work capabilities it's easier than ever for companies to look abroad for workers.

I did some PowerShell here and there and basically did this. \n 1) Who are all the retired employees?\n 2) When was the last time they have logged in to there exchange 2016 or Online. \n Nearly all have not logged in within a year or more. \n ​\n My concerns are that;\n 1) They don't have MFA enabled. \n 2) They may contain sensitive information in those emails. So if the email becomes compromised that becomes accessible information. \n 3) If the account becomes compromised, they can use that email to communicate to other employees and make it easier to social engineer them. \n 4) A wasted license. \n I am still new to my role and I may be paranoid for nothing, so from a more experienced individual what are your thoughts on this and if its best to get rid of this plan what are the reasons? \n I have some directors that agree with me, but my VP of technology doesn't (Ironic I think). \n ​\n But of course if a user isn't trying to log into there account would it really get compromised?

I had it working and could even use it to authenticate 802.1x connection attempts.\n Unfortunately, disaster struck and now I'm trying to recreate it from scratch and I'm having a hell of a time trying to get even the most basic stuff working. I've managed to set the 'admin' password and can query the root DSE from Apache DirectoryStudio using 'cn=admin,cn=config', but that's about it. I can't change, create, or delete anything.\n I made a post on something similar two years ago, but I was trying to create a RO user for RADIUS to search the LDAP database for user authentication. I just don't remember encountering this specific issue before, the last I recalled, I had to create a RO user but it appears I can't even do that as the admin user itself is RO.\n What's even more frustrating is that all the howtos and docs I've been reading over the last four days all assume that admin can write! My admin account can't write anything except its own password apparently.\n How do I get the admin user access to everything (like a proper admin account) so I can get this project off the ground? \n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/firestorm_v1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone. Just looking for some advice. I work in a public hospital system with 8500+ employees. Myself and one other person are responsible for Mobile Technology in all forms: Vocera, Encrypted Flash drives/Ironkey, iPads/iPhones and MDM (Intune), the corporate cellular account, and BYOD support. \n We've basically been slammed since COVID happened. We work 50 hours a week, then get paged off hours because we didn't get to that one ticket that is now suddenly \"patient impacting\". Despite working without a lunch break, being in many meetings for projects (6-10hrs a week), and working my ticket queue when possible, we never catch up. For the past two years, we've never been under 100 requests, and we've been building two new sites that have many different mobile applications in which I'll somehow be supporting. As of current, my team of two support over 17k devices including 5k personal devices in BYOD. \n I know nowhere is perfect, but I feel my boss is being arrogant when I ask him about hiring more people. His response is always \"this is only a phase\" or \"we're fully staffed at what we have, we'll have to get caught up\". But other internal IT depts are hiring like crazy. The apps team hired 5 in the last two years and the epic team brought in a whole company of 20 contractors to do their breakfix while they worked on our new sites. Just as examples\n I guess what I'm asking is is this situation everywhere? Am I dreaming that IT life doesn't have to be so understaffed and overworked? I'm salary and don't break 75k, and my coworker is at 55k. We get great healthcare, which is why I stay, but just wondering if you all think I should man up and realize I work in a stressful environment and IT is that way everywhere, or is there better out there somewhere? What's it like for you all in similar roles? Thanks for your thoughts!\n    submitted by    /u/ITnoob16  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope I can explain this clearly…\n We recently upgraded PSU’s in the server from 550w to 700w. According to the Dell website, the new PSU you install will take on the firmware of the previously installed PSU. So, in this case our 700w PSU is using the firmware of the 550w PSU. Obviously we just need to install the firmware for the 700w PSU’s. Here’s the catch, Dell doesn’t have any firmware for 700w PSU’s for this server available to download. There should be firmware available for download because you can buy the r6515 server from Dell with the 700w PSU’s installed. \n When we boot up the server it enters the bios and gives a low power warning. \n IDRAC says the input wattage is 666 and output wattage - rated: 700, actual: 550. \n We have been talking back and forth with Dell tech support and their tier 1 support has no clue what’s going on. They sent technicians out this week to install a new power board but that didn’t do anything to help. The technicians got one of the Dell tier 2 support guys in the phone but he didn’t help much either. \n Anyone have any ideas or have any experience with this situation?\n    submitted by    /u/Coolio-McFoolio  \n [link]   [comments]",

We already use Symantec on our Windows servers and clients, and while it has a Linux version, it lags behind in supporting recent Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04) and it doesn't play nice with containers. We have a bunch of Ubuntu servers at various locations running QEMU/KVM virtualization, Docker (in VM), Kubernetes (nodes in VMs) und LXD containers (on bare metal) backed by local ZFS storage.\n We're looking for an option that is capable of dealing with containers, so that we'd only need to install the AV on hosts and VMs, and that offers sensible licensing/pricing, ideally per physical server instead of full price per install or at least reduced price for a VM install. Centralized management would be nice but not a requirement, log and/or mail based alerts would suffice. Needless to say we require good detection rates, timely signature updates and the capability to prevent the execution of malware. The main threat scenarios are malware getting on the servers either via compromised clients, exposed vulnerable services (hello Atlassian) or supply chain compromise (hello npm).\n The state of AV websites is a sad affair, with a general lack of clear statements about capabilities and business licensing options and costs (its all \"Contact us!\"), thus I turn to you.\n    submitted by    /u/zravo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had the interview this past Monday-nailed my interview including the interview with the V.P. However, I made it clear that I had other interviews that week and could not formally respond until Friday. Another job offered me $28 or $56,160 a year. I called back Job A, recruiter was kind and asked me how my other interviews went. I said great and thanked him for being patient, I said another job offered $28 and wanted to see if they could match it. I stressed that I really wanted to work with them. He asked if I’d take anything lower so I said $27. This is about a $4K difference than their original offer. Normally I wouldn’t negotiate but I feel I’m the perfect person for the role-they actually sought me out from a job site-hounded me for about two weeks for an interview. They ended up offering me the role hours after my interview. My question is, did I screw up? If they reject my counteroffer, can I go back to their original offer? I didn’t make the counteroffer as a non-negotiable, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask. He said the latest I should be hearing back is early next week. I wouldn’t start this job until Nov 7, after my two weeks notice with my current company so the delayed acceptance is not an issue.\n    submitted by    /u/NessaC12  \n [link]   [comments]",

Don't ask about it.\n This week, Microsoft 365 just disabled Basic Auth from our tenant.\n So, if you are using Schemus (their sync tool) and syncing from Exchange Online (EXO), app passwords won't work anymore. \n Worked with Broadcom's support. Surprinsingly, so far so good. \n Support adviced to:\n - upgrade Schemus to latest downloadable version ( Schemus Synchronization Tool – Mandatory Upgrade (broadcom.com) ) and apply a support-supplied patch. This will enable Microsoft Graph as a source and enables usage of Exchange Online Cert-based auth.\n - Install Powershell 7.03+ plus EXO v3. If using Server 2012 R2 (like me...don't ask again) you need to create a config file so Schemus knows where to look for PoSh 7.\n - Configure an App Registration in Azure AD to allow to authenticate against EXO with a certificate (CBA, App-only authentication in Exchange Online PowerShell and Security & Compliance PowerShell | Microsoft Learn )\n - Reconfigure Schemus to use EXO CBA. \n - And that's it...supposedly.\n Why supposedly? Well, seems like Schemus still uses EXO v1 \"get-recipient\" and that causes a timeout for us for just the \"user\" sync part (which is optional, but we use it). I managed to reproduce that error and compared against \"get-EXOrecipient\", which worked fine. Already told them that, so I guess we will have to wait for another patch from Broadcom's developer, Metanate (the one who develops Schemus).\n Hopefully this will help others who are stuck with Broadcom's stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/dfctr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mostly we administrate some servers or databases for those (so we run Ansible, we connect to databases, replace certificates and such tasks). Every customer is sharing us a VPN – mostly personal accounts with 2FA, not a site-to-site or a general VPN account. This means that every new colleague is getting a new VPN account. Some VPNs require additional configurations (f.ex. setting routes/DNS manually), some not. And we have plenty of technologies: OpenVPN, L2TP/IPSec, FortiClient VPN, Cisco, …\n As some are using Linux, some Windows, some macOS – there are always troubles setting the VPN's up.\n We first started using OpenConnect, which supports a lot of different VPN services. But we had the problem that some configurations did not apply correctly and that some IDS systems detected this and it was forbidden by the IT.\n So: I'm looking for a way how my co-workers easily can connect to the different VPN's. I'm currently thinking of creating an RDS Server for each customer with everything preconfigured, authenticated by a certificate – or maybe something with Amazon WorkSpaces. But I think there must be a better solution to this.\n How do you handle this? Do you have an idea how we could gain some efficiency instead of a long on-boarding process and big documentations?

          "description": "Currently our company has a weekly rotation of technicians who end up on call. Last night I had about 6 alerts come in from one location. It was about 1.5 hours of afterhours work and then it was resolved at about 11:00 PM.\n Later throughout the night, I had two more alerts come in around 1:45 and 3:00 AM that were short term disruptions that resolved themselves. In addition, I had two clients call in at 3:00 AM and then 5:00 AM about their VPN connection not operating. I missed these two calls, and my manager is furious with me because \"that is what is expected of the on-call person.\"\n Is it reasonable to expect someone who receives alerts like this, respond to them throughout the night and be expected to start work at 8:00AM the next day and work a full 8-hour shift? Yes, we do get additional compensation for the week of being on call, but my thinking is that setting these expectations is what results in mistakes being made and on the job injuries. I'm not saying that you shouldn't work the next day but expecting someone to be up and running first thing and being sleep deprived is not a healthy thing.\n Am I wrong for thinking about it this way? What are your thoughts on this or what expectations does your company set?\n    submitted by    /u/No_Interest_5818  \n [link]   [comments]",

Those here before me started the process of turning it on everywhere, and got stopped and canned for attempting it, even after getting the okay and explaining/communicating the process company-wide. They also want to make it so screens don't lock automatically, and want to use a single shared account for all the public workstations (meeting rooms and such) instead of logging in with their own account or bringing a laptop for presentations.\n Basically C-Suite says: I want all the computers to be unlocked and working before I get near them\n But my experience says: 2FA everything, lock every screen after 10-20 minutes of no activity, detect and disconnect mouse jigglers if needed, and always use unique accounts even at public kiosks\n This company is constantly under attack from phishing/spoofing and can't afford to pay for better M365 tiers to mitigate it. One of the IT Directors used the password Passwerd2020 a couple years ago, and the pen tester was able to use that account to find and access a full AD backup (don't have more detail on this, but it was bad).\n Seems they should be freaking out about how bad their security is, instead the execs are just trying to poke more convenience holes.

Word then locks up while searching for the printer (which it can't find the default printer because they are not on the VPN or Network with permission to the printer). Eventually times out and seems to remember the time out for that session of word. It does cause other delays also\n Others are saying they get around it by setting a default printer to the local PDF writer but that isn't really the best option. \n It seems office is trying to connect to get the page setup information from the printer. Is there a setting somewhere to change this behavior. We are kind of stumped at the moment.\n    submitted by    /u/lost028  \n [link]   [comments]",

It really got me thinking about all the abuse I've had to deal with over the past 20-odd years. Fellow employees yelling over the phone about tickets that aren't even in your queue. Long nights migrating servers or rewiring entire buildings, come in after zero sleep for \"one tiny thing\" and still get chewed out by the Executive's assistant about it. Ask someone to follow a process and make a ticket before grabbing me in a hallway and you'd think I killed their cat.\n Our pay scales are out of wack, every company is just looking to undercut IT salaries because we \"make too much\". So no one talks about it except on Glassdoor because we don't want to find out the guy who barely does anything makes 10x my salary.\n Our responsibilities are usually not clearly defined, training is on our own time, unpaid overtime is 'normal', and we have to take abuse from many sides. \"Other duties as needed\" doesn't mean I know how to fix the HVAC.\n Would a Worker's Union be beneficial to SysAdmins/DevOps/IT/IS?

So I set up DKIM for Gmail and go the DNS provider to add that TX record. \n After enabling authentication, I'm finding the \"Sending email\" dialog in Thunderbird on my laptop sat there for ages before sending. Sending email from the GMail web UI didn't do this. Now, some ten minutes or so later, I tried again from Thunderbird and there was a flicker of a pause, but nothing like before. So I'm hoping the initial long delays were just because the DNS changes were propagating. Can I hope this is the case?

Not consistently, it can usually ping the DCs in its domain and in the forest root above it. But the lookups tend to be slow. And many other servers in the domain don't resolve.\n I've done a netsh winsock reset and a reboot, which I thought fixed it (I could resolve a hostname that wasn't previously working) but just seems to have made it a little better, not fixed it altogether. I've removed the virtual NIC and put a new one in. I've switched temporarily to DHCP. The issue persists. It's using the two domain controllers as DNS servers, the same as every other server in that domain, and they're all fine.\n \"Test-Netconnection DC1 -p 53\" connects successfully (as does DC2).\n If I do an nslookup for anything, it finds it. But if I immediately ping it, chances are, it won't resolve the name.\n Name resolution fails regardless of whether I just search for the NETBIOS name or the FQDN. I've tried putting a random dot at the end of both as per some ancient article I found on Google, but that doesn't work either.\n This server has just gone live to the whole business, so I really don't want to rebuild it if I can avoid it, but I'll try most non-destructive things out of hours.

With a good bump to my salary. As smaller MSPs are, I've got a rather broad spectrum of skills but I am no master in a lot of those. Well, that may be knocking myself a bit down, but you get the gist.\n My new employer put me into a department that will also be focused on providing managed services with some focus on cloudy stuff as well as even providing private cloud instances to customers. I am destined to be a network-guy (but it could change to something else if it fits, I am pretty open to other positions), which fits the focus of my previous position, but with a lot of focus to newer technologies like software defined networking / SD-WAN and the like which I have pretty much no clue about. (Well, I setup a vxlan peering on my proxmox-homelab-cluster and connected three VMs with it, but that's about it :-D)\n I guess I made a good impression and I was pretty honest about this lack of knowledge on my part, so there will probably be provided training at the start and I will not be expected to have this knowledge. I think I showed enough willingness to learn new stuff and general interest in IT to be a future asset to my employer.\n Be that as it may, tldr, I'd love to read up and learn about the newer network-concepts like SDN/SD-WAN and stuff in this direction but I am not sure where to start exactly. Can someone point me in the right direction? Or maybe recommend some good papers/videos about this stuff? I'd like not to focus on a specific manufacturer, but if they provide good content I don't mind.\n Thank you very, very much!\n New_Leek_102\n    submitted by    /u/New_Leek_102  \n [link]   [comments]",

Two days later I finally get a response that the disk is fine... but something is wrong with the (out of warranty) device. They want me to sign a new 3 year agreement and they'll give me a free box (I'm on the cusp of not wanting to work with this MSP anymore so a commitment is not high on my list!).

Since it's budget time we're looking for an all-in-one solution for joining meetings and the Smart board 6000s Pro seems like a pretty legit solution but I just don't know anybody who's actually used it. According to the product page it can join all of the major video conferencing platforms, and supports AirPlay mirroring, so it would wipe out all of the extra we have and users wouldn't have to change much. Does it have a lot of hardware compatibility in terms of webcams? Is it easy for users to use? Does it give a good experience when using it on all of the different meeting platforms? Anything I'm not thinking of?\n    submitted by    /u/Superspyi  \n [link]   [comments]",

When changing from one day to the next at one point Outlook will not draw the bottom part of the calendar and wherever you click Outlook will click that amount of cells not rendered up or down. See screenshot for the example, I clicked in the blank space but the selection was above my click. https://imgur.com/a/KxOkHv6\n Initially I thought this was an Azure Virtual Machine issue but I have since been able to recreate it on a physical machine as well. I have tried the latest Office beta but the issue persists. I have reinstalled Office, recreated the profile, used Online only mode, tried the reg key to disable hardware acceleration, tried different hardware, tried different accounts. At this point I don't know what else to try and suspect it is a flaw in Office because I have seen this with a different user who has reproduced it in Excel workbooks that have formulas that changes the display while it is running.\n I have a open ticket with MS on this but I thought I would ask here as well.

          "description": "Hi Everyone,\n Our main corporate location has been suffering from a rather annoying issue for almost a year now. We have a 600 user office in the midwestern United States. The trouble is, Google is classifying our public IP addresses as being in Brazil. This is rather annoying for our users, as search results return the Brazilian versions of websites as well as the search results appearing in Portuguese.\n We can easily switch the search results to English, but the Brazilian websites still appear as first results.\n Normally you can enable the browser to detect your location (probably also through public IP), however we have an Edge group policy disabling this. We are unable to enable this due to security concerns (even though every website can view our public IP anyways).\n Ultimately it looks like the issue is an incorrect location mapping in Google’s geo-cache. I have submitted multiple automated requests to get this updated (using this: https://support.google.com/websearch/workflow/9308722?hl=en). However after around 50 submissions over various months, nothing has changed.\n We are a full Microsoft shop with no Google products (so no line of sight to any direct Google support). Looking up our public IP’s using ARIN show the correct address information. Other browser and IP based location services also correctly identify our location.\n Has anyone ever ran into this issue or have any ideas on how to remediate it? I know it’s nothing on our computers because Google correctly identifies the IP location of our remote users and all of our other offices. Unfortunately it is this one office with the issue.\n    submitted by    /u/jspang16  \n [link]   [comments]",

Previously I would use something like EvilGoPhish to phish employees/customers and steal their session cookies to bypass MFA but this does not work with U2F.\n Then I came across an article that mentioned using WebUSB to defeat YubiKey and of course where one attack exists, other attacks also exist.\n The important quote from this entire article.\n  \n\"Vervier and Orrù found that they could code a website to connect to the Yubikey Neo with that WebUSB feature, instead of with the usual Chrome API for U2F that it's designed to use.

The security team is not super tech savvy to put it nicely , but will just log into server and make changes not knowing what they are doing. An example it logging into Windows servers and stop/disabling the firewall service. They seem to be making all the decisions for the enterprise environment, software to use or not use. I am not talking like we will not allow some software because we see it as a security issue which is actually their job, but like running the evaluation of major software like Okta (which i like by the way) then buying it and forcing it on the rest of IT without their testing or input. They seem to spec out the hardware not just say ever device needs to be from proper sources and have TPM etc. But they have no idea about hardware or how it works. They are opposed to anything open source which kills me. I am very cautious about open source, but sometimes it just is needed. To many example for non open source vendors with huge security issues that they don't fix or disclose. Security by obscurity. They love to hold everyone's feet to the fire about change control but do impacting things without using the change board, nor notifying the impacted persons. Like someday getting an e-mail from the application that your admin privileges are gone without any notice. CIO seems to be ok with this. Like cyber is doing all the work on the move the cloud? \n This all seems really backwards for me, but I need perspective. My idea of security it to set policy, weigh in on enforcement changes, set infrastructure goals for the actual sysadmins to move toward a more secure posture, deal with incidents, and stuff like that.

I'd like to ask which of these 2 would you go with if you had a choice? or if there is something different all together you'd recommend? the VM cluster is very overprovisioned for what we have, so this will be a bit of a rightsizing attempt based on current workloads. consuming about 40-50GHz of CPU at rest, 500GB of Memory, and about 15TB of storage. a full flash solution would be my preference to keep our IOPS performance equivalent to Pure.

          "description": "Hi guys,\n We have a product which sends out system notifications to our customers Sysadmins etc. We use SendGrid to send these emails (which works like a charm BTW).\n However - several of our customers are asking if we can send the e-mail from their domain (so that the FROM field would be [\"someone@customerdomain.com](mailto:\"@customerdomain.com)\".\n I've looked into the whole authenticated domain setup in SendGrid (which we went through ourselves) - and this seems like the correct approach. However: \n 1) What would the most \"correct\" approach be? Should we create a subuser and then authenticate domains for each of our customers on this subuser? Sending our customers the SPF record etc. generated by SendGrid.\n 2) We're not all that interested in doing this manually every time a customer asks. Does anyone have experience with using the SendGrid API for authenticating domains? \n I'm a developer (not a Sysadmin), so I'm a bit worried to mess something up. Basically we just want to use our SendGrid account to send emails from different domains (approved by the owners of the domains).\n Could anyone walk me through the correct way to do this?\n I've tried reaching out to SendGrid support, but they just keep sending me to the same \"How authenticated domains work\"-article, which doesn't explain the scenario I'm interested in. \n Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)\n    submitted by    /u/Durandal1984  \n [link]   [comments]",

After multiple years of unimpeded cloud growth, the findings suggest enterprises’ soaring cloud spending may tempered as talks of a looming downturn heat up.\n As organizations move forward with digital transformations they set out on at the beginning of the pandemic, multicloud usage is becoming increasingly unwieldy, and costs are difficult to manage across hybrid environments.\n Furthermore, a wrench has been thrown into IT teams’ plans over the last two quarters in the form of the market tumult. Rising inflation and interest rates, along with fears of a potential recession have put increasing financial and operational strain on organizations. As a result, many companies are reevaluating their digital ambitions as cloud spending is brought under the microscope.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/DrinkMoreCodeMore  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n Since about a year, Microsoft refuses to offer us support through Teams-calls and instead only wants to reach out by phone. For us, having calls over the phone instead of Teams is quite inconvenient as we prefer having multiple team-members on the support call at the same time. Of course, it's possible to have multi-person phone calls, but it's obviously not as optimized as Teams. Also, scheduling Teams-meetings through the calendar in Outlook (which we used to do) instead of 'verbally' by mail brings the added benefit of not having to miss calls because the support-engineer mixed up his timezones. Finally, sharing single screens through Teams is better than being forced to share your entire desktop through Quick Assist.\n Does anybody know why they do this? When we ask, they avoid the question. For us, it's both inconvenient, irritating and strange, because it looks like they deem Teams to be an unsafe way of communicating. Before this, I generally had great experiences with MS Support, but this is just really annoying.\n    submitted by    /u/Hamburgerprins  \n [link]   [comments]",

When testing LAPS, we have set the name of the administrator account to manage to be RAccess, and were expecting to see the LAPS password applied to that account. What is happening is that the disabled built in administrator account is being re-enabled, renamed to RAccess2 and the LAPS password is being applied to that account. We're rolling out the client via SCCM, and have tried installing it both before and after adding the devices to an OU with LAPS set up. Any ideas where to go next would be appreciated. Everything that I have read suggests that LAPS will not create, enable or rename accounts.

I'm wondering what sort of laptops your companies are giving out to users these days? \n We formerly had desktops, but we moved to a new office that the CEO insisted on setting up as a flexible workspace, so everyone needed laptops, and then covid showed up and we went remote.\n We currently have MS Surfaces (the CEO's choice) through a 3rd party vendor. Most people seem to really like them, but I'm getting complaints from a few people that then need more powerful ones. Particularly a few people complain about the amount of ram they come with. I've got a user insisting they need at least 64 GB of ram to work properly, more than is available in a surface. I'm deeply skeptical of this particular user's claim, but that's a different issue. I sent him to his department head to argue with him about getting the budget. If he actually gets budget to buy one, I'll need to source it whether I think he really needs it or not. \n Anyway, what sort of laptops do you all like to send out? How much ram do they typically have?\n    submitted by    /u/DJDoubleDave  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some context:\n I work for a computer refurbishing/resale shop. We operate mostly through online sales and handle hundreds of laptops and desktops a month. I typically am responsible for refurbishing and repairing units for resale.\n We set up a WDS server just running on a local network (not connected publicly) using an old netgear router for handling DHCP to quickly load units. The WDS is configured properly and works , as long as the images are good.\n The issue I run into is sometimes is dism doesnt pull a good image from a unit, and breaks the WDS (Shows no available images if a bad image is present) . It took me a solid 3 weeks to figure out what was going on, but eventually came to the conclusion that if I delete the bad image from the server, then the WDS continues working properly.\n ​\n My question is this,\n Why are some images bad? and how can I fix it? 85% of images I make work flawlessly, while some simply refuse to make a working image. \n Steps taken so far:\n Most recently we got some Dell 7460 AIO's in, around 40 of them. I created an image as I always do, and loaded it on to the server. The issue occurred so I deleted the image and used a different unit to make an image, still no dice. I then tried using dism healthcheck and repair commands, dism sees nothing wrong with the image. I tried using compression on the image to see if that would make a difference. The image is Windows 11 Pro, and the Dell Optiplex 7460 is fully updated. I also tried making a Windows 10 image and that did not work either.\n I'm not sure if there is a correlation but here are some of the other models I cant get a working image for:\n Lenovo T540P\n Dell Latitude 5491\n Lenovo T460\n ​\n I cant understand why the WDS will simply reject some models. I'm hoping someone has some insight.\n ​\n Disclaimer: Ive only been studying and experimenting with networking stuff for the last year, so if there is information missing please feel free to ask. I apologize for my ignorance.\n    submitted by    /u/magzmusic  \n [link]   [comments]",

The administrator create user accounts and generate an account specific url for account activation. Transmission of the url is the responsibility of the admin.\n To go further, I plan on implementing some SSO methods.\n My guesses are:\n  \ngoogle\n openId\n microsoft AD (this one will be fun to debug, as I never understood windows server XD)\n  \nFinally come the question:\n If you had to sysadmin such a solution, what SSO solution would you expect to find by default ?\n (And to go further, what kind of functionnality would you expect to find out of the box ? )\n ​\n Thank you in advance :)\n    submitted by    /u/Elvandar_Ysalys  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lots of files and folders is missing. And it seems random which files is missing and which dont.

Figured there would be a few hiccups, given how thorough (/s) our testing team was. Sure enough got a P1 ticket that they are unable to process files from a system this morning. Turns out they were using sftp to push files up to the old server for one of the data flows.\n So, easy enough fix. Once I was sucked into the P1 group call this morning, I told them exactly what needed to be done. Put in a request to get ssh access to the new server, and here is the new path to the directory. Easy peasy, just like I sent out last week.\n Cut to 6 hours later. The call now has over 20 people on it, including management. They are dissecting all the data flow diagrams, and just ruled out the application server as the issue about an hour ago. Two managers asked me to rejoin the call, and before they could even 'recap' everything they've done so far, I pasted a screenshot of what I told them needed to be done from 6 hours ago, and got dead silence.\n Seems one of the offshore managers (yes, this is ALL coming from our offshore \"support partner\"), stepped in at the end of the call this morning to manage the issue. They are supposedly working on the access requests now and will let me know. In other news, now management wants me to write up an RCA as to the problem, and corrective instructions. Sure, no one read my emails over the last couple weeks warning of this change, they ignored my instructions for the fix this morning, and the still don't seem to fathom what they did wrong.

We have recently been discussing whether to extend this to the chaining of both Machine and User authentication.\n We are currently discussing whether to perform the User Authentication using PEAP (EAP-MSCHAPV2) or EAP-TLS with a User Certificate. \n For Machine Auth I would always use Certificates rather than PEAP, but is it just as easy to manage user certificates? And are there any security concerns? From a Machine Auth perspective, the user has no business touching the certificate unless they have local administrator rights on the PC (And they don't).\n In this case, the Certificate will be issued to the User itself, so what kind of access do they get to the certificate? Will they be able to possibly export it with a few tweaks even though we issue it as 'non-exportable' from a PKI perspective? The fact that they have just the slightest access to the certificate itself, makes me wonder if it would be best to stick with PEAP for User Auth and keep Certificate Based Auth for the Machine only.\n    submitted by    /u/Ebteasa  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would have expected to see an even number of drives for SSD's, not an odd number. I thought RAID5 shouldn't be used with SSD's? A single boot drive doesn't seem like a good idea (plus 3.84 TB is a lot for a boot drive). I suppose one could be a hot spare since they don't have on-site IT Staff, nor do they have an MSP.

I can get the PIDs from tasklist, but that's just a single point in time. I can get the PID to local port linkage from netstat, but that's also just a single point in time. I could enable process auditing, but our Security event logs already roll over too fast to scope troubleshooting across a full day because of file auditing (Splunk is tightly controlled with a formal change process, so that's out for stretching the log storage in any kind of timely fashion).\n I'm aware I may be able to catch this in ETL format, but my ETW game is weak and limited to: pktmon capture > pktmon etl2pcap > read in Wireshark; I have no experience at all with collecting app data in ETL.\n At the end of the day, I'm just looking for a single tool I can run that can get me these four fields for diagnostic purposes:\n  \n<PID>\n <Process Name>\n <Source IP>:<Source Port>\n <Destination IP>:<Destination Port>\n  \n   submitted by    /u/SevaraB  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys,\n we are a medium sized dev company. As of today, any application is developed in our own tenant. Devs are able to register new apps, grant (most) delegated permissions and start hacking away (loosely speaking).\n There are a couple of issues I see with that approach:\n  \nApps grant permissions to production data.\n Bugs or misuse can lead to data loss.\n App credential stealing can lead to data loss and leaks.\n Registering enterprise apps can lead to data leaks.\n  \nFor that reason, I'd wish that development is out-sourced to a non-production tenant. Or better: Each project gets their own tenant. We have a couple of dozen parallel projects and this could prevent teams getting in each others way - even if that would be only by accident.\n There are currently two ways I can imagine how this works:\n  \nFor every new project, a standalone tenant must be registered. If licenses are needed, they must buy-in. Ideally, this is managed completely separate from IT e.g., by the project manager or a designated tenant-owner. They manage the tenant registration, credit-card info and payments, licensing. We have a devops-department, maybe also they could take over dev-tenant management company-wide.\n For every new project, a M365 developer subscription sandbox is registered. The upside to this is that it is batteries-included with licensing and sample data in most used areas like EXO and SP. The downside is that this tenant is linked to a person in the company, who may leave the company at any point in time. (Now that I think of it, we could use service accounts to have this not linked to real people.)\n  \nI imagine that this tenant should not be managed by IT at all. The project members are responsible for security, compliance and data privacy.\n How are you guys managing this kind of stuff? Are there other solutions I have not thought of yet?\n    submitted by    /u/Caleb__  \n [link]   [comments]",

This one, however, when I apply the cert users can't login and event log shows 0xC000035B. Replace the new cert with the original one (not due to expire for a few more days), and all good again.\n I figured it might be the cert (somehow), so I tried adding our wildcard cert to the RD Gateway instead. Sure enough, same error. Put the original rds.domain .com cert back in, it works.\n I found various articles suggesting setting EnforceChannelBinding to 0 (via regedit) on the RDG server, which out of curiosity I've done - no difference. I also set LMCompatibilityLevel on my PC to 3, no good. No other posts I've found so far that have to do with that error code have much else info i'm afraid.\n Has anyone else ever seen a new SSL cert cause users to fail logging in? Or does anyone have any ideas where to start looking? Nothing has changed server-side other than the cert, and besides - you'd think if it had, the old cert would have broken... Thanks in advance!\n ​\n EDIT: The only thing different from the last time is that there's a new firewall in that does HTTPS inspection (or something along those lines, it's managed by a 3rd-party). I'm reaching out to them, in case it's the difference in SSL certs causing this, but does that sound likely to anyone else?

          "description": "Before I describe the problem everyone will probably be happy to know that I've already told them to change the hostname of Device B and to never talk to be about this again. But I have a bug up my butt because I should be able to detect where this is coming from, but so far I can't.\n My company writes custom applications that create custom problems. Today's problem is that something is creating dynamic DNS entries on our DNS server on behalf of another device, and the DNS entry it is creating has an IP that conflicts with another device on the network.\n Device A is a Windows 10 PC with IP 192.168.1.100 and hostname Device-A. Device B is some embedded device with IP 192.168.1.200 and hostname Device-A. That's right, duplicate hostname. So the DNS entry for Device A gets over-written with the 192.168.1.200 address and then they can't reach Device A on the network.\n The problem is that it isn't Device B that is creating the entries on the DNS server. We turned Device B off for 24 hours and something still was creating the DNS entry, but I can't find what is doing that. I've run Wireshark captures, Microsoft Network Monitor captures, ProcMon captures, and checked the DNS-Server Audit log in Event Viewer. I can see plenty of entries of Active Directory dynamic updates, arp/LLMNR/NBNS/MDNS queries and responses, SMB advertisements, but none of them are for Device B that I'm looking for. \n Clearly the problem is that I don't have a deep enough understanding of the mechanisms behind this behavior. So I'm hoping someone can throw some terms my way that I can Google and read up on. Or some articles that describe what's going on. I've been doing some Google searches but I'm only finding generic articles/tutorials that don't give any insight into what I'm looking for.\n Thanks in advance for any info you can send my way!\n Edit: Both devices have static IPs configured, no DHCP is involved.\n    submitted by    /u/LearningSysAdmin987  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it sufficient for SMB?\n Ages ago I read up on Azure security defaults (link on bottom), and it appeared to only register users for authentication methods, but it did not enforce MFA use for users, instead only admins. \n Shortly after the announcement - it appeared that they added a \"smart tracking\" (per se) that would have users use MGA when it is necessary. \n With that in mind, does anyone know the exact rules to when users will need to reauthenticate?\n Is this sufficient for SMBs (less than 30 users), or should I use per-user MFA/force upgrades to licensing for Conditional Access?\n I understand that there are many factors, but I would like to understand more in depth. Through testing, I have confirmed that new IPs trigger MFA, but I want to be sure that after some time it get's triggered again.\n ​\n Link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults#require-users-to-do-multifactor-authentication-when-necessary\n    submitted by    /u/Vel-Crow  \n [link]   [comments]",

To me, it seems more rational to host everything in Azure instead of splitting services out between the two platforms.

Apparently they cover construction costs as well up to 10K for dedicated lines but not sure what's involved. Does this look on par with typical dedicated business fiber rates? If we have a Business Fan account with cellular lines, can you somehow get a package or deal of some sort when adding fiber?

Also, would it be possible to ask them or the 3rd party contractor to lay OS2 single mode cable (vs cat6) as it's more future proof?

          "description": "Hi, \n I have been wanting to do this for a long time, One of the things that I am really passionate about is using a data driven approach to save money on Cloud spend. The most rewarding jobs I have undertaken in the past are going into an AWS environment and saving money on cloud spend and optimising the best performance for less money! \n It's a great value add for any organisation. \n Alot of the organisations spend more on fancy tools to try and save money on Monthly cloud spend which I think is pointless as it often outweighs the cost of the money they try and save. Also I have seen tools that don't even check the basics. The data is already there for you in AWS and it's simply a case of extrapolating it using a bit of engineering time which you pay for anyway and the result is that you can often save more money! \n Certainly I have seen it a lot here in Reddit, Cost is becoming ever more prevalent in many AWS environments. \n Two things to mention, There are copies I will give away for free to those engineers who will agree to read it and implement the savings ideas in their environments and give me feedback and comments, So it would be good to see how much you saved over a month. It would be interesting to gauge feedback. \n I have to spend a bit of time mentoring Juniors in the past so I know especially at the moment how the job market is. So I will give away free copies to Junior engineers looking for ideas how to break into the market and some handy tips to increase your chances of standing out when going to for an interview. \n If you feel this is you, Feel free to DM me. \n Anyway without giving too much away, I have produced a guide for it here. \n Amazon Kindle Link\n    submitted by    /u/DevOpsMuffin39  \n [link]   [comments]",

I dont know what I did but I managed to change my only account on the laptop to local guest user from administrator. Now, there are things that I cannot access becuase it says it needs the approval of admin.\n Usually there will be a prompt like, \"Do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device\" and it has an option of \"Yes\" or \"No\", but since there is no admin now, it only has \"No\".\n I'm stupid I know (lol) but i dont know what to do. hahaha. Highly appreciate it if somebody can suggest what I need to do. Thank you :)\n edit: I have the windows 11 now\n    submitted by    /u/staysalty31  \n [link]   [comments]",

This server has an internal only web app on it so could be java related. Also has Firefox on it and Chrome. External access is via reverse proxy in Azure.\n As a precaution, I have changed all domain admin accounts, audited the admin usage accounts, and changed all 30-odd service accounts.

These requests were NOT on the offer letter I signed regarding the promotion.\n I respect my old boss, I respect my old small team, I don't want to leave them high and dry... but I'm also excited to move into this specialized role, and I need to spend some time getting up to speed to perform... and honestly, I'm just done with the generalist life, I want to move on, close that chapter.\n Any advice on how I go about this?\n    submitted by    /u/minimum__fresh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys,\n I have a topic to get my head around. We´re a small company - not going into details here - going heavy on SQL servers. By now, we have a small on premise infrastructure (4 Hyper-V hosts) which I wanna bring towards Azure in the future. While I plan the migration, I also want to enhance our daylie routines, workflows and such. The network is/was a mess when I took over.\n Back to the topic:\n Our users require access to MSSQL, create/restore backups and make changes to different databases (I want them to be able to spin up their own databases according to their needs). For now, they install MSSQL Server XXXX locally and use a per-core license, which is working completely fine. My problem: I´m sure the licensing is not correct, so I see urgent need to change this.\n My assumtions there is no difference between licensing SQL Server (Per-Core) on a server system or a client system. \n So my idea was to spin up SQL servers (Dev, Test, Pdroc) with 100% correct licensing, give users access to it with permissions as needed and ban the locally installed SQL servers completely. Any thoughts on this? How are you guys handleing it if the Express edition is not an option due to the restrictions? \n Thanks for your ideas, have a great weekend!\n    submitted by    /u/SignificantBeat1547  \n [link]   [comments]",

When a user turns on the machine, I want the log in screen showing only options for the previous logged in user and \"Other User\".\n Any advice its really stumping me...\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Jewpacarbra  \n [link]   [comments]",

Background is that we wanna use VMware Horizon and everyone else doesn't.

Beacuse of privacy laws and whatnot the users will reside on the remote AD, but they are supposed to log in in our domain.\n This is all fine and dandy, everything works alright, except one thing that I have no idea how to replicate:\n The main domain is called something like domain1.school.int but they log in with [user@school.int](mailto:user@school.int)\n now our domain is also underneath school.int like this: domain2.it.school.int \n I want to be able to login with the same [user@school.int](mailto:user@school.int) that they can in their domain, all that works now is domain1\\Username or [user@domain1.school.int](mailto:user@domain1.school.int) \n what exactly am i looking for to do that?\n    submitted by    /u/deGanski  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys,\n I'm pretty new in the sysadmin world, currently undergoing my training. My first year or something is in the endpoint management/helpdesk team.\n Atm I'm taking care of setting up new notebooks for users. Here's a short description of the workflow:\n Supervisor sends hardware request - > I send out a premade mail requesting info about software the user needs - > I install the software and set up their HCL Notes - > hand out to user\n Now the issue is that the mail that I send out also asks for the user's Windows and Notes passwords. Every cybersecurity workshop will tell users that their sysadmin will NEVER ask for their password (which is totally correct, right?)\n Obviously we'd somehow get into their accounts anyway so handing out the passwords doesn't really change anything, it just feels wrong I guess? And it probably actually is. \n We need the passwords for a few minor settings in Notes and that's it. I asked my colleagues about it and they answered it with concerns that if users did these settings by themselves they'd scew it up and we'd get more tickets.\n My point of view is that I think that this could be done by the users with a well made tutorial.\n I've been getting more and more confused/negative answers towards the password mails that I sent out so it's also a personal issue because I don't want to answer a mail like \"Yes you are totally right, however...\". \n How do handle this at work and how could I change this situation for the better?

          "description": "The goal of this process is to give the CPU something to execute in case there is nothing else to do (thus it is called idle ;-). Let’s think about the next situation, we have a process using 30% of CPU, in that case PID 0 (System Idle) will consume the remaining 70%. Also, Idle is the first process that the kernel starts. Moreover, there is a kernel thread of System Idle for each vCPU the OS has identified .\n The reason for having an “Idle Process” is to avoid an edge case in which the scheduler (Windows schedule based on threads) does not have any thread in a “Ready” state to execute next. By the way, there are also other schedulers IO and Memory, which we will talk about in one of the next posts/writeups.\n When the kernel threads are executed they can also perform different power saving tricks regarding the CPU. One of them could be halting different components which are not in use until the next interrupt arrives. The kernel threads can also call functions in the HAL (hardware abstraction layer, more on that in the future) in order to perform tasks such as reducing the CPU clock speed. Which optimization is performed is based on the version of Windows, hardware and the firmware installed.\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've zero experience in power apps in general and even after a couple days of learning etc I still feel utterly clueless. For instance, I cannot figure out how to see what the contents are of an orphaned flow, when I share I just get an error about sharing to myself to see what was in the solution flow (which apparently only exists with these).\n ​\n I suppose I'm just seeing if anyone was ever in my situation (went from generic admin to a specialized engineer role) and had success with it.

I logged into my account today and after receiving my 2fa from number 122395, I received another from 1-855-909-0331. Hmmmm. Now I am trying to figure out who is at fault here. How did a 3rd party know I just logged into NS in order to send me a fake auth code and how did they know my number? Does NS have a breach? Cant be my phone vendor, for I logged in from a laptop. If traffic was sniffed on my network or pc, there wouldnt be anyway to see the phone number. NS tier1 support didnt know what I was talking about and escalated the case. Hope to get an email from support soon. \n If anyone reading this could log into their NS account to see if the same thing happens and share your feedback, it would be greatly appreciated.\n Side Thought: Why is NS still using SMS for authentication. They have been around a long time. Would be nice if I could use my Yubikey or even an Authentication App.\n    submitted by    /u/redditaccountunknown  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not keeping up on upcoming changes I see Run As accounts are no longer an option and am trying to adjust my Script to use the managed Identity that is created with the Automation resource. The way it worked before was the Run as Account would get a few permissions once it was created the App Reg would get\n  \nApplication Permissions\n Select User.ReadWrite. All\n GroupMember.ReadWrite. All\n Delegated Permissions\n User.ReadWrite\n  \nIt would also get User Admin RBAC role. All of these permission were needed to change the password of a Synced up account and also was used to Read group membership of a security group that had all users with access in it so if one was disabled it would then force a password change Now with a managed Identity I understand it is suppose to be easier but am not able to get it to Write the changed password . I assume it will also have issues with the group membership changes script also.\n Here is the only snippet of the Script where the Run as account was called\n ## get automation account: $connection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection $azconnection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection Connect-AzureAD -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $connection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $connection.CertificateThumbprint write-output \"Connected Azure AD\" Connect-AzAccount -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $azconnection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $azconnection.CertificateThumbprint write-output \"Connected AZ Accounts\" \n    submitted by    /u/jej0584  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR; manipulated the school system, got caught, then got the job as an admin a few years down the line. \n When I was at secondary / high school, my ICT lessons were always the best. It was a time where I did 20% work, and 80% trying to exploit the system to gain some sort of advantage over the other standard student accounts. Now, I wasn’t doing this for any malicious intent, just for personal satisfaction. \n Our school had everything very locked down as most did for a student. The limitations were as I would compare to an exam/ kiosk type account at the time. One IT lesson, I was looking at the pxe boot options and found they were using SCCM. I was hit with a login screen and almost admitted defeat. I thought, what the hell and tried my student details. They worked \n Turns out the sysadmins had just added the \\domainusers group to authenticate. Once launched, I was able to re deploy a Windows environment and more notably to me at the time, create a local admin account. Once I found this out, I was able to sit at my allocated computer and happily install all the programs I wanted and hide my tracks. ICT lessons then turned into 100% fun. \n One day, I got caught out by a teacher remotely viewing my screen and got called to the IT office. Had to explain what I had done and instead of a slap on the wrist, I was praised for finding the exploit! \n 2 years after I left the school, I then got a job as a system admin at the same school and even used that scenario to my advantage during my interview. \n And we all lived happily ever after!\n    submitted by    /u/marco7532  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, if I rebooted them and logged in, the problem didn't happen. Then, if I logged out and back in, the problem started up again. Very annoying and tricky to troubleshoot. To make it more annoying, the problem would eventually fix itself over night and the user could log in again and work normally. I'm relatively new here and my coworker said he'd never been able to fix it, confirming as well that it would eventually fix itself over-night.\n Repairing VMWare Tools didn't help either.

That's getting that switched to use my client's domain, but I didn't even think this was possible.\n Relevant headers from a test message showing it passing SPF (client's domain) and DKIM (ESP's domain):\n  \nAuthentication-Results:\n spf=pass (sender IP is x.x.x.x) smtp.mailfrom=service.client.com;\n dkim=pass (signature was verified) header.d=esp.com; dmarc=bestguesspass action=none\n header.from=client.com; compauth=pass reason=109\n DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=esp.com; i=@esp.com; s=dkim; c=relaxed/relaxed;\n q=dns/txt; t=1665520754; x=1668112754; h=content-transfer-encoding:content-type:subject:date:to:from:mime-version:list-unsubscribe:x-thread-info:subject:to:from:cc:reply-to;bh=jdBAlGXcZ<snipped>KDm8k=\n From: donotreply@client.com\n  \nIf there doesn't need to be any type of domain name alignment, what prevents a rogue actor from just putting their own DKIM-Signature there.

          "description": "I got several cases, where users complain that after Monthly patches being installed they see only one notification from Software Center (Config Manager), it's the last one which gives them 15 minutes to a forced reboot. It was not a case for everyone so I started digging and I found that it happens only for people who use the \"Focus Assist\" feature in Windows 10 (former name \"Quiet hours\"). So it was obvious that people who have set \"Alarms only\" won't see the reboot notifications, but there is also an option called \"Priority only\", where you can select applications that can show notifications - this works well when the user chooses Software Center as a priority app manually, via the GUI.\n I'm wondering if anyone knows a way to centrally add items to the priority applications list (via GPO or script)?\n The ideal solution would be to:\n  \nDisable \"Alarms only\" mode in Focus Assist\n have a possibility to add \"Software Center\" to the priority list applications\n  \n   submitted by    /u/TheM4jor  \n [link]   [comments]",

I faced similar situations on Linux with 100% of the cases ending in htop (linux command) showing me the exact culprit. If not by CPU usage then by CPU wakes.\n Recently my opinion solidified when facing the highest CPU usage I've ever seen on Windows 10 on my laptop. This time I knew the culprit upfront (broken windows search, confirmed by windows reliability history error messages). Windows Search constantly banged the CPU and failed to start, CPU die constantly at 65 deg C. As soon as I fixed Windos Search the CPU die temperature dropped to ~40 deg C! The thing is the entire time neither of the built-in Windows Tools (including the Sysinternals Process Explorer) showed any useful information on the issue. No listed component spiked to more than 3-5% of CPU. Even the memory usage tab in Resource Monitor was better at hinting the culprit than the releavant CPU sections!\n What are your thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/rimbooreddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi. \n I have pretty much no knowledge about networking but trying to fix a problem in work. We have a control unit on our furnaces which was connected to a laptop via Ethernet that displays all data and history on the program we use. The laptops battery has bulged massively so I’ve decided to rearrange the previous workers setup and I installed an ssd in the pc I use in here as well, hoping to run the program and work network all from the same pc. I bought a switch which both the network and furnace control unit are connected to. I’ve successfully managed to connect to the network but i cannot ping the control Unit. After reading a bit about switches I can understand the problem but no idea how to fix it. The unit has its completely separate ip address. I’m assuming when pinging, it’s trying to find the ip on the network. Is there anyway I can fix this and connect to the control unit ? \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Chriso132  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our Sophos SG is our internal gateway to all of our vlans so the Sophos XG will be the same. We would like to put the two in parallel so that we can slowly migrate a few vlans over at a time, but are struggling with the gateway/routes part.\n Without changing all our IP's and to keep gateways the same - are we best to create a new vlan exclusive for routing all traffic from the XG to the SG?\n For example we disable vlan 2 on SG 192.168.2.1, we then enable vlan 2 on the XG 192.168.2.1But our domain controllers and remainder of our environment is on the SG. So do we static route interface vlan 2 to the IP of the SG? How will it know how to process vlan 2 traffic if the vlan is turned off?\n Our aim is to pick one on prem application at a time and essentially test it before going live. And with everything live and in parallel we can log into the SG and Cisco ASA to compare rules and figure out where the config is incorrect on the Sophos XG.\n Any help or guidance would be appreciated.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/TrashAmbitious9083  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m guess this excessive amount of routes is due to their blended circuits with full bgp routes so I’m probably receiving all the prefixes with multiple paths and that’s the reason the prefixes are 2.7M ?\n Also in terms of memory will the ASR1001 non X edition support 16GB of ram (2x8 GB) or is it only 4GB sticks with a maximum of 8GB?

          "description": "I’ve been a little stumped trying to troubleshoot a site of mine. I’m an IT engineer, I like to think I’m not a complete n00b, I’ve successfully been in this field for 10 years I just neglected to learn some of the basics but do well at learning on the go. \n This site has 1GB single mode dedicated fiber coming in to the MPOE. We are currently, and temporarily, using an office space with existing infrastructure. They got CAT5E running to this MDF, into my Meraki MX100, and then back out over CAT5E into a Meraki 24PoE switch (can’t recall which model at the moment but can confirm ports are 1Gb compatible) and then to 4 Meraki MR42s. We are a commercial construction company, this site hosts our team as well as our subcontractors which are mainly an architectural firm and a mechanical/electrical/plumbing — aka high usage on full days (250gb up and down). The device connections are spread evenly across the WAPs. Channel utilization is also spread well. Users connected to the WAPs max on speed tests at 72mb. On these busy days there could be 30-50 users. I’m trying to understand how there’s so much loss to the user. I haven’t been able to test directly myself, but the ISP Claims their circuit test results at full speeds. Tests from my router max at 750mb. Tests from the switch max close to that. Tests from the WAPs max at 200mb. Again the user even on a light user day gets 72 — but on busy days they experience soooo much latency and I’m just… lost. I cant see where or why. \n Application usage in the dashboard shows normal activity, UDP or secure web, MS apps, AWS etc (lot of cloud storage, pretty much everything is SaaS). \n But I do wonder if the CAT5E is an issue. \n Can anyone provide some guidance on testing further or troubleshooting? Or validate my one and only theory? Thanks in advance and sorry for sounding like a network n00b. I promise I’m not a total beginner.\n    submitted by    /u/ThatOneTDGuy  \n [link]   [comments]",

This worked for HTTPS, but broke HTTP redirection causing the site to fail if you didn't specify HTTPS. \n Next, I thought AWS might work if we moved our domains there because they allow ALIAS records for root/apex domains, but after closer inspection it seems limited to only pointing to something else hosted at AWS. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html\n After a bit of a learning process, it's looking like the only real option to route ALL traffic through our WAF is to pay them to host our subdomains/root domains for us.

In looking through the onie repo the SN2100 isn't even listed as supported hardware and it hasn't been updated for 5-8 years. \n Is there an image on the switch that works somewhere, or is this something that everyone has to deal with? How do I get an OS that is made for the switch and works properly?\n It seems crazy to me that a company would sell a product that is so expensive and then just have a pointer to an open source project and not even say \"good luck, have fun! lol\". :(\n    submitted by    /u/Wild_Doctor3794  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've used this setup before and it's easy with everything else I have running. Right now, it's all wired. \n My question is: if that were to be shared on open wifi instead of ethernet, what dangers to the host/\"main\" network would there be?\n I know that if I were using a normal router for this, I'd be concerned they would navigate to 192.168.1.1, enter a correct password or bypass an insecure login page, and wreak havok. So I would know that I need a secure router and a good password or I could put management on another VLAN. \n I'm aware of possible concerns about peer security. Client isolation will be enabled in the access point to this network. \n What concerns are there with Windows ICS \"acting as the router\"?

For the last two years our data closet has sat gathering dust, and I got fed up with a perfectly good 80TB of shared storage sitting unused. So I took a photo of all the various serial numbers, brute-forced the passwords (they were all the defaults - go figure), and bought the company’s first PC to see what I could do.\n Here’s a list of the equipment on our rack from top to bottom: - D-Link DGS-1210-16 (not connected to anything) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “LAN”) with cat6 cables running to stations - HP1920-48G network switch (labeled “LAN S”) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “PHONE”, the phones and their breadboard-looking-box have been removed) - CISCO Catalyst switch (Labeled “PHONE S”) - NETGEAR ProSafe XS712T switch (with one fiber expansion port, connected via fiber to NAS, and Ethernet to LAN, second NAS) - 24-port RJ45 patch box with mix of Cat 5e, 6, and 6e ports that run to CAT7 cables to edit stations - Synology DS1618+ - Synology DS3617xs\n My goal is to get an office network up and running with the CAT7 lines running 10Gb to edit stations and Cat6 lines running 1Gb to producers stations. From there, I want to host a server for Signiant Media Shuttle that will allow my NAS both through my router’s firewall and to the office network. I presume this means it all has to go through either the 10Gb or 1Gb switch (or both?). My office has 1Gb fiber through Verizon, and we have their router.\n If anyone out there has any advice for me, or can point me to good resources, I would greatly appreciate it.\n https://imgur.com/a/EaComxr\n    submitted by    /u/ReelBack96  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I started a new job and in a process of modernizing my network. The current network is a huge layer2 domain. The customers are in R&D and use a lot of multicast and broadcast. I am planning to turn this network into layer3 since 90% of our traffic is east-west. I am thinking to implement the spine-leaf topology. And utilize vrf-lite for each customer. My network is spread between five different buildings. The farthest building is probably 3000ft away from the main one. Also, the fiber between buildings is either OM1 except for the farthest one.\n It seems like I am going to be using Cisco C9300 and C9500 (or maybe 1u Nexus switch)\n  \nCan I use C9300 as leaf switches?\n Can I use C9500 for my spines?\n  \nI am thinking to deploy a couple of leaf switches to each build. I am not sure if this is a good idea or not. My understanding of the spine-leaf network, the vrf-lite exists only at the leaf level. If I have a tenant that happened to be located at two different buildings, the tenant's VLANs will be extended via vxlan / l2vpn. Am I right about this? Does the VLAN in bldg A need to match the VLAN ID in bldg B for the same tenant?\n Also, I am still wrapping my head how the routing between tenants. Since each tenant will be placed in a vrf-lite, then I would have to use route-leaking. Do I need to create an ACL on the leaf switches if the traffic between tenants must be restricted based on their applications (e.g. ssh, ftp, etc.) only?\n For my infrastructure, servers (AD, NTP, DNS, DHCP, ISE etc), Docker containers, end-users, and oob (ipmi and network management), should I put these on their own vrf-lite or should I put them on the master/default table? What is the best practice for infrastructure?\n ​\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/forwardslashroot  \n [link]   [comments]",

The client has an available public IP in their static block. I configured the client firewall to use one of those static IPs and Im trying to think of the best way to set up this handoff. Current set up below:\n Coax > Modem > Ethernet > Router > Ethernet > Firewall. \n The connection from the ISP router to the firewall is connected to one of the ISP router's switch ports. My opinion is its probably best to plug the VOIP provider's device needing a public IP directly into one of the other ISP router's switch port.

Yay.\n I'm trying to determine if \"old\" fibre is perfectly fine if it still works. You either get a 1Gbps connection or you don't - or - signal degradation and packet loss could mean a functional connection with a seriously low maximum capability even though the link is established at 1Gbps.\n What happens over time? 5 years, 10 years, 15 years? Does the capability of the medium degrade and lose performance? Do you get \"indicated\" 1Gbps right up until the point where you get no link? Do you get indicated 1Gbps but no where near the 1Gbps throughput and packet loss? \n It's been quite hard to search for the answer, and I think I'm just using the wrong search terms, or this isn't widely discussed. \n ​\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/b_muz  \n [link]   [comments]",

We've kept default settings mostly, no firewall but no ports being forwarded, except 22 for ssh which goes to a DMZ and then to the pi. 443 and 80 take you to the gateway login screen.\n First question: Does having no firewall matter if we're not forwarding any ports? Surely traffic just dies in a slightly different way?\n And much more importantly:\n Am I going to get DDoS'ed on port 22 any day now? /var/log/auth.log shows failed connection attempts every few minutes. The root account has a complex password with timeouts per attempt, so I'm not worried about access, but is it only a matter of time before some more ambitious bot discovers an open ssh port serving password attempts and has a thousand computers a common password dictionary on me? Or some Russian hackers take me down just so they can pretend I'm a drone bill the KGB?\n If yes, is the way to be safe to close down all ports and use openvpn to gain access? (This sucks because we'd like to access our gateway if the pi goes down). Or could I geo-lock access and save myself? \n But at the end of the day, even if the gateway is set to deny all requests except ones from my own ip address, couldn't someone DDoS the firewall?

My question is specifically with Juniper vs Cisco: route preference vs administrative distance?\n Still working on the details, but as of now we have branch office router seeing two default routes one in IGP OSPF and another in BGP. One of the default routes is for internet access and the other from corporate (Incase the internet default goes down).\n The branch router runs IOS-XE, Corp device is Juniper, and the internet default comes from a Palo-Alto FW.\n Our Juniper rep has said to change Cisco’s AD values to match theirs and guess what our Cisco rep said the same thing for Juniper!

There is some electric interference present around them (120V) but these are 600V rated Cat6 cables. Since they are 600V rated, they are very bulky. Customer suggested us that the weight of the cables could be causing the issue at the switch. I find that difficult to believe since only 4 out of 60 Cat6s are acting up.\n I am thinking as a first step of troubleshooting to re-terminate both ends for the cables.

For the ISP Connections... They are going into Ports that are tagged as VLAN 17 & 18 .... And the Firewalls are connected to more ports that are also tagged as VLAN 17 & 18 ----- Does this mean that the Internet is \"piping into that first port\" and then any other ports that are tagged as 17 / 18 ... are automatically getting blanketed with that ISP connection (Just like how an unmanaged switch works)? And Thus.... in the Eyes of the Firewalls, the Firewall's WAN Port just thinks that you took the Ethernet cable from the back of each Modem... and plugged it straight into the Firewall?\n In all my years of experience with networking, I have only ever seen the chain look like this:\n ISP Modem >>> Firewall >>> Core Switch >>> Smaller Switches >>> PC's / Printers / AP's / Etc\n So the fact that this job is setup backwards (in my eyes) as:\n ISP Modem(s) >>> Core Switch >>> Firewall >>> Smaller switches >>> PC's / Printers / AP's / Etc ---- And the fact that I am a Cisco novice lol...

But my question is, is there a way to create a default route in azure to send all internet destined traffic to my palo alto vm that is internet facing? Furthermore, is there a way to advertise that same default route and advertise it to a downstream spoke via eBGP, in this case OCI assuming that the eBGP peering is already in place between the two clouds. Would I perhaps need an azure route server , and pass this default route from my palo vm via ebgp, so that azure/oci internet traffic all goes out of the internet interface of the palo vms?\n    submitted by    /u/BlueberryThick  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am extremely novice to the Python world but was recently assigned a task of doing data collection on around 100 IOS switches so it’s not very feasible to manually SSH to all of them and run show commands, nor should it be. I need this done by the end of the week which is why I am trying to use this script that’s already published as I know I won’t have time to learn from the ground up by then.\n Anyways, I am not having issues running the script, I am able to run it fine and it “works,” but the account I have for access needs to pass the enable password which this script doesn’t account for, so whenever it tries to create a new file using the host name via ‘show running-configuration | i host name’ it just ends up not naming the files with a host name like it’s supposed to, and overwriting them because I can’t view the running config with my account. I have been trying for a couple of hours to modify the code to allow the enable password, but I just can’t seem to figure it out. I was able to create a very basic script and use net_connect.enable() which worked for passing the enable password, but was only ran on one device and didn’t export the output to a file which is needed. After I was able to get that working, I tried adding that bit and the enable password into the ShowCollector code in multiple different areas, but ultimately couldn’t get it to work, and now I am stuck on where to add the parameters which is why I am here lookin to get some pointers/ideas on where to look! \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Littleboof18  \n [link]   [comments]",

Trying to determine which port it was plugged into, I ran: show mac-address on the switch and it showed that the device was connected to the trunk port, so I SSH'd into the switch that the trunk port runs to (SW01) and ran the same command, it came back showing that the MAC was attached to port 3 which is the trunk port that runs to SW02.

          "description": "Hello fellow network nerds! :-) For many years I have been helping to send out RIPE Atlas measurement probes (world's largest open Internet measurement platform) in the US - initially a few hundred as IPv6 deployments happened. There are currently ~1,400 active probes in the US. But with some newer ISPs there are gaps that would be cool to fill - initially newer ISP connections like Starlink and 5G fixed wireless (TMo & Vz). (Next year maybe some rural FTTH ISPs.)\n In my day job[1], I just renewed our RIPE Atlas sponsorship which gives me another block of probes to deploy. If you might be interested in hosting a probe on your connection, I am guessing I will have probes be able to ship them in about a month (given the upcoming IETF meeting starting this weekend). Once you receive a probe, it connects to your network via Ethernet and you will need to use the RIPE Atlas site to activate the probe – which is about 5 mins work.\n If you might be interested, please PM with the following info: Your first & last name, your shipping address, and your email address for probe activation process.\n Don’t know what RIPE Atlas is? See https://atlas.ripe.net/ \n Thanks! Jason\n [1] Day job is at Comcast where I work on Internet measurement and new standards and lots of other good-of-the-Internet sorts of stuff. This RIPE Atlas system is run by RIPE NCC - all I am doing is facilitating distribution of probes in the U.S. Here's a somewhat recent paper I co-wrote about Internet measurement: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372135.

Why does a connection get a fraction of the transmission capacity? This makes no sense to me.\n In the TDM, you're switching between circuits, but the speed of the link doesn't go down based on the number of active circuits. But I guess you could argue that the transmission rate is reduced since you're not sending data when the circuit switched from you to others, so it's a if the network is slower, but when you're sending data, you're sending it at full speed possible by the link. But I don't understand why a 1Mbps link is quartered to 250kbps if there are 4 circuits? Or is this saying the same thing I said, it's a if the link speed is reduced?\n In the FDM, this makes completely no sense to me. You're dividing the spectrum, but you're sending stuff in parallel and at full speed just with its own bandwidth. No?\n    submitted by    /u/Jastibute  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently in the last chapter on Network Troubleshooting, on the section ipconfig/ifconfig/ip. He shows an example of the macOS/UNIX ifconfig output, and on the inet line it says:\n  \ninet 192.168.4.78 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.4.255 \n  \nI'm just wondering why does the netmask show in hex and not dotted decimal or CIDR notation? Wouldn't it normally be written as 255.255.255.0 or /24? \n This seems to be specific to the ifconfig output, as ipconfig shows the subnet mask with dotted decimal notation, and ip shows CIDR notation. This is the first time I've even seen a hex netmask, as literally the rest of the book has used dotted decimal or CIDR notation. Even in my limited real world experience troubleshooting computers and networks, I've never seen a hex netmask.\n I've tried Googling the answer, but most of what I found was just decimal to hexadecimal conversion charts, or talking about hexadecimal in a general sense not really networking focused. From what I read I think it might just be a remnant of the early mainframes and UNIX systems, and the language they ran on. But I can't find anything definitive about it. \n I don't think it ultimately matters what notation the subnet/netmask are written in, but I am I wrong is there some system out there where I'll need to know how to convert binary to hex for subnetting?\n    submitted by    /u/StJerneJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

Clients get a static IP address and our routers/firewalls etc are configured to (dis)allow those clients to the backends. So basically, every client can get an ACL list attached to it. \n But now we are going full into Azure. Since the Azure VPN gateways only give out dynamic IP addresses our current setup can't be transferred to native Azure VPN's. \n I've seen that Cisco has the CSR 1000V in Azure, but I can't find anything regarding static IP addresses (or pools) in the documentation. So, I'm not sure if this would fix our \"issue\".\n Does anyone have an idea on this issue? I'd rather not deploy a VPN gateway for each set of users. ;) I'm also not tied to Cisco btw.\n    submitted by    /u/necrofrost76  \n [link]   [comments]",

It works at 10Gb fine to the above Switch using a non-25Gb (SFP+) cable, but as soon as an SFP28 cable is used to that Switch, it doesn't show a connection on either end (NIC or Switch). However, using a regular SFP+ cable, both work fine. And the SFP28 cable works in a different NIC entirely connecting at 10Gb, so the cables are fine. And the NIC itself is fine, since it works at 10Gb perfectly fine (and once at 25Gb fine (I even took a screenshot to show a coworker we were finally at 25Gb internally)).\n However, I'm at a loss at what could cause it no longer working, especially when neither the NIC or the Switch is showing any sort of connection using SF28 a cable. And ESXi shows the connection as \"Down,\" of course.\n And the server is fairly brand new, so I know it has plenty of PCIe lanes to absorb and plenty of empty PCIe slots to use up since dual-CPU server. I think I tried slot 5 and 7 in the server. It initially worked that one time on slot 5 (I think it was in riser 2?), but stopped after a few hours.\n Multiple cables, multiple manufacturers (10GTek coded for Cisco (initial); Macroreer coded for Intel (last resort)).\n Dell will obviously not assistance since the card is aftermarket, but I have 2 and both are doing the same thing in this same server.\n Link for proof it DID work <once>: https://imgur.com/a/33jBzsH\n Any sort of assistance/direction would be greatly appreciated, as I'm clueless at this point.\n    submitted by    /u/marvin83  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys, first of all I'm not a high-level networking engineer, far from it actually, but I know my way around most of the stuff we need to do, and as a lone sysadmin I kind of have to.\n We recently migrated to Nutanix and along with the nodes we got ourselves a pair of new Alcatel OmniSwitch OS6900 TOR switches. Tricky ones to manage, but solid. \n Our old server rack will be decommissioned but our old TOR switches are not that old at all, they're a pair of HP FlexFabric 5700s. Our core switch, on the other hand, is a VERY old HP 5406zl, with rapidly dying PoE ports and a general feeling that the whole thing is going to die soon as well. Switches are still hard to find, so getting new ones would take at least 6 to 10 months. \n So, in the meantime, I'm thinking about replacing the 5400 with the 5700.\n Now, when I say \"core\" switch I do not actually mean it, it's by all intents and purposes an access switch: no l3, no gateway, no nothing. All routing is done through the firewall. All it has connected to it are clients, and a trunk to the TOR switches.\n We would not hit any of the limitations of the 5700 (i.e. the 1024 entry arp-table) but we would gain a healthy new switch.\n Yet, since I constantly doubt myself, I'm asking Reddit: am I missing something here?\n    submitted by    /u/camazza  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have maintained the solution with a very basic level of Cisco knowledge he passed on. We are looking at replacing the devices before we face an outage and are scrambling. We are trying to find a more user-friendly solution that still does the job and thus I seek advice.\n Currently, we have two Cisco 1811 in a data center. Our needs are fairly simple and I have been told in the past we can replace both with a single device these days. We have an Incoming device that has VPNs to the providers and contains all the traffic from field devices. That is connected to the second outgoing CISCO directly and then routes traffic via VPN to various clients based on which devices are theirs.\n Traffic to the internet is restricted with a few exceptions, some IP based, some port-based.\n What replacement device would best meet my needs? Preferably something with a GUI interface instead of the CISCO command lines. \n *edit to add some details*\n My concerns are really just about the two routers into one or needing two.\n At present, I have some IP routes for each client VPN, like below.\n ip route 10.232.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2\n ip route 10.232.24.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2\n ip route 10.232.32.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2\n I also have to NAT everything from one provider's VPN to the client VPN.\n ip nat inside source static 10.232.128.200 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n I don't really care about the brand, just function and something a bit more user-friendly for a fairly entry-level of networking knowledge.\n    submitted by    /u/jlarmour  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently I had a Cisco AP (3802i) swapped out for an Extreme Networks one (AP250) trying to test something. Got the Extreme AP connected and it connected back to XIQ fine. AP reported that there were several clients connected to it and I figured everything was fine. Turns out things were not fine as the clients (primarily iPads) now consistently disconnect from wireless. Some flat out drop off Wifi and say \"Cannot connect to X network\" or that they can't connect to the Internet and other times they appear to be working but with low signal strength. I think they're going from the Extreme AP to a Cisco one that's in another room across the hall from where the Extreme AP which is really odd since that Cisco AP appears to have really weak signal going into that room. \n ​\n The same SSIDs are configured on both Cisco and Extreme with the same VLANs being attributed to both. We use the same model of Extreme Network APs in another building and they work fine. My guess is that the clients keep trying to connect to the Cisco AP instead of the Extreme but I'm not understanding why when the Extreme AP should have better signal strength vs the Cisco one. I know mixing APs from different manufacturers isn't really ideal but this was the only room where we made this kind of swap.\n    submitted by    /u/BuffaloOnAMotorcycle  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its a temporary network, so speedy deployment is important, using UBNT will help with that.\n Below is my initial plan and looking for feedback if this will produce a stable enough network: \n There are two floors in play here (F1 & F3, F2 is not used/not part of this) \n Floor 1\n - Room 1: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP\n - Room 2: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP\n - Room 3: 128m2/40 people, 1 AP\n - Attrium, 1600m2, 300 people, 6 AP \n Floor 3\n - 4 rooms of each ~100m2/50 people, 1 AP each \n Total: 13 APs, probably order a few extra to fill in potential gaps. Probably will we rent the equipment. \n People have one or two devices, so I probably need a /22. Disable client-to-client communication, to limit broadcasts/ARP-traffic on the network. Alternative would be to split it in smaller subnets, but people will roam around, so I think that is not convenient. \n Build up time, 1-2 days.

I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, \"The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term.\" Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don't need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. \n  \n Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place.

In order to access it I have a USB stick that acts as a network license. It is plugged into my PC, my PC sees it, and when I open the software it checks to make sure before allowing access. I pay for a few seats of these software, all of which run through the USB network license. It maintains count of how many people are accessing it.\n I have a few remote employees who VPN into my network. In order to access the software they change a few settings in the SKM files per their (SKMs) direction, log into the VPN, and it sees the license, good to go. Except one employee.\n For some reason this one employee cannot \"see\" the network license once he is logged into the VPN. I went over to his house, brought my laptop, connected to the VPN, only to have the same issue. My laptop could not \"see\" the license either. \n I have spoke at length with SKM about the issue and have tried every recommendation on their end. They have simply chalked it up to some network issue, which I'm beginning to agree with after troubleshooting. \n The license uses something to check and i go to localhost:1947 to check. Not sure what this changes, just stating it as a fact. I've tried looking into the network adapter settings, etc. but I really don't know if what I do will help as I'm not that informed on networking issues. \n For the record, server side and user side firewalls are all off. Other employees do not have this issue, and neither do I when I am remote from my main office location.

There's a whole bunch of other stuff happening with it (like how I can't ping any VSI - even if they're up) but the most baffling to me is that I can't ping the loopback address at all. \n It's a Cisco 3850 stack with 7 members. 1 master, 1 standby, and 5 line cards. I have Loopback0 configured with an IP of 10.0.255.4 and no matter what, I cannot ping it. Even if I console into the router and use \n ping 10.0.255.4 source Lo0 \n it times out. Isn't the loopback supposed to be working, even if nothing else is? All it has is the ip address command in its config. \n Additionally, I can't ping ANY VSI on the device, even though all of them are up. We have a few dozen and they've all been working as expected, but starting this morning we can't ping any of them. Here's an example :\n  Interface Vlan148 ip address 10.0.148.1 255.255.255.192 no ip redirects no ip unreachables no ip proxy-arp  \n There's also some netflow commands but they're long and I didn't really feel like typing them out. I doubt they're relevant. \n Anyway, a computer under Vlan148 (148.17) cannot ping its gateway (148.1) yet it DOES have full access to the whole network internal and outbound. I'm completely lost. \n Even more weirdly, the device (when console'd in) can't ping anything itself, yet still sends SNMP logs, registers devices in the arp cache, creates OSPF neighbor entries, etc. \n This is just so strange. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n EDIT: Partially resolved the issue. Turns out VRRP was causing this somehow, as disabling the VSIs that use VRRP fixed the issue. Tomorrow I'll have to figure out why exactly VRRP did this, but for now, it's resolved.\n    submitted by    /u/scp-507  \n [link]   [comments]",

New data center connection to the world would be gigabit, so plenty of bandwidth there.\n Do people still typically leave behind a DC and a NAS? Nothing but a firewall? Direct connect? We run light SQL loads, AD and VOIP, that's about it. There are two other corporate offices in the US connected via site-site VPN and the other sites are OUs in Active Directory. In each site, there is a physical DC as well as virtual on esxi - and esxi obviously hosts all of our servers in each site. There is no shared storage for esxi, it's all local to each site. Considering moving to RD Gateway model for the users who have been used to local LAN speeds for all applications as some are a bit rough via WAN (such as document management).\n Thanks for any ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/Budget-CaterpillarJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Okay, I think this is a straightforward question. I have a location in my EIGRP WAN topology with a secondary WAN link. I want this secondary link to advertise the LAN networks learned from the local L3 LAN switches, but I want to use the reliability metric at this duel circuit location to make routes advertised from the secondary links a feasible successor. \n All Routers in the EIGRP WAN are only configured to consider the Default metrics (BANDWIDTH/LOAD) when calculating the best path.\n Now, describing this in writing has already made me feel like the answer is \"no\" because the other EIGRP neighbors would not use this new metric when calculating the best path. It may make more sense to modify the LOAD metric. I think this would mean the routes may not be installed as feasible successors, but they would be used if the primary Router failed. \n What are your thoughts and ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/Skaffen-_-Amtiskaw  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of my first tasks is to get an old managed HP 1910 switch up and running to be added to the network. I have a brand new USB to rj45 console cable. I'm using putty with serial connection enabled. Bits per second 38400. Data bits 8. Stop bits 1. With both parity and flow control set to none. Com 3 is the only serial line that pulls up a terminal. However the terminal is blank and after waiting 10+ mins multiple times and even power cycling during the terminal or before trying to connect, I am unable to get any text to appear on the terminal screen. Am I missing something? I'm feeling kinda dumb here. Any advice is greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/ScaredNetworkTech  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's OK for now but an opportunity presented itself to have fiber run between them at almost no extra cost as part of another project. I don't have any equipment right now that would be using it so it would be kind of future proofing and would be nice to have an option of 10Gig as I can easily see that being asked for in the future. Now, having never used fiber before I'm not sure what fiber should be run? I was asked if I want single- or multi-mode. What should I choose? I traditionally stick with Cisco switches, in case this is important and the distance between the locations is at most 200 ft.

          "description": "So the question I have relates to Cisco Jabber. The User (or Users) can make calls from Jabber going from Jabber on his laptop to External company numbers. However they are not able to contact Internal company numbers.\n Naturally someone said it sounds like a routing issue. (Most of the company has Jabber working this is a new group being stood up working from vpns)\n User(who is on a vpn) can ping all the way into the Datacenter to the call manager server, I can ping from the switch the server is connected to, to the User PC. I can ping both directions from the Data Center Backbone switch. Routing seems to work. \n ​\n So here's my thoughts. If they are able to talk to external numbers then the traffic has to go all the way into the datacenter anyways and hit the server before going back out again. Also from what I saw in emails of previous troubleshooting the Jabber Client on the PC is saying connected as far as registering with the server goes.\n (also for your knowledge I'm mainly from networking side of the house, we have a separate dept for the phone stuff so typically don't get too much into phone issues most of the time.)\n ​\n Jabber Outgoing - > External Number - Works\n Jabber Incoming<- External Number - Works\n Jabber Outgoing -> Internal Number - Not Work\n Jabber Incoming -> Internal Number - Not Work\n ​\n Any thoughts of what more to look into or questions I should ask?\n    submitted by    /u/BeemanIT  \n [link]   [comments]",

We would prefer (though this is not essential) a single box and something that does not require subscriptions. One of the key requirements is that the stack has no single point of failure as we need to meet high uptime guarantees and so I am looking for something with a redundant power supply (I suppose 2 cheaper switches might be ok). We also need to be able to access the device management interfaces (iDRAC, IPMI) of devices on the internal network remotely and so need to have some facility to create a VPN (this seems preferable to a jump host). So, the requirements are: 1) Redundant power supply 2) Firewall 3) VPN 4) 10GbE minimum (SPF+ is preferred to RJ45) 5) <10 ports required\n Our main issue is that everything available that has redundant PSUs has 40+ ports and costs $$$.

Techbuyer have a useful product filter here: https://www.techbuyer.com/uk/catalog/category/view/s/network-switch-selector/id/482/ but all the results are switches with 40+ ports.

          "description": "I oversee a few campus networks where each campus currently has 1 subnet/network for voice and data that spans multiple buildings.\n I'd like to create a VLAN (200) specifically for the phones but use a unique subnet per building. This will allow us to tell the phone system if network = 1.0.1.0/24 use e911 number 555-555-0001.\n Building A (with the firewall) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.1.0/24\n Building B (uplinks to Building A) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.2.0/24\n Building C (uplinks to either Building A or B) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.3.0/24 \n Currently all Buildings have a 'data' VLAN (1) using the subnet 1.0.0.0/24 \n IIRC, this can be done via VLAN Mapping or Translation? Not something i've every used. Unfortunately, our HPE OfficeConnect (1820/1920 mostly) switches don't seem to support this. (I hate these switches) \n My first thought was to create a VLAN on the firewall per building with a DHCP scope/relay and somehow convert that VLAN to the same phone vlan on the switch. However, I realized this isn't easily doable - I could connect two untagged ports together to accomplish this but, ew. \n My next thought would be to utilize the switches to handle VLAN 200 and set up a DHCP relay (our switches won't act as DHCP servers (nor do i think i want to manage that..) I believe all of our switches are Layer 3 lite - allowing for routing. This would work but i'd have to let the voice traffic traverse the data network and add in routes on the firewall to point to each network switch.. it sounds messy. \n Is there a solution that I'm not seeing to accomplish this?

However, for the router to connect to the ISP over this SFP modem, it requires tagging a VLAN on the WAN interface.\n If we were to set the SFP and RJ45 ports to access ports to some random VLAN - e.g. 2000, and then set the router to tag VLAN2 on the WAN port, would the switch see the VLAN2 tag on these access ports and then just strip the VLAN tag?\n One of our other options is just a SFP to RJ45 media converter, but then that requires extra plugs, and an extra point if failure, not to mention more cost rather than just plugging the SFP into a switch and partitioning the switch out, not as costly as a router but a cost that the client would need to bear.\n Alternatively, we could just upgrade all of our clients to routers with SFP ports, but then we're going to need to convince the clients to put the money in to upgrade their routers in the cases where they don't already have routers with SFP ports.\n Any opinions on the best way forward while still being cost efficient?\n Thanks all!\n    submitted by    /u/SirLagz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey folks, I maintain a small coaxial cable TV plant for a campus with a few dormitory buildings (about 400 rooms total). It's really simple with the CATV headend (digital QAM modulator) and we pipe in our licensed channels to it in addition to a few in house channels for signage and information. We're making a new dormitory that will be all ethernet and no coax to the room to use simple digital CATV enabled TVs. \n It appears the hospitality IPTV market is large from fancy ones that have splash pages that welcome you with customized information to your room. I do notice that at the hotels a lot of them have set top boxes behind the hospitality TV and this seems complex. I feel like buying hospitality grade smart TVs will lock us in or perhaps the set top box is the way to go? How much do these systems cost to maintain and license? is it even worth it?\n I really like the simplicity of coax CATV, just scan for new channels (the channel plan rarely changes) and go, so I can just push to get coax installed in the new dorm to each room and extend CATV to the dorm with HFC fiber. Change my mind?\n One possible driving factor for IPTV is to also allow users to watch IPTV on their desktop or mobile devices. I can technically hit the multicast IP on the distribution side (source to QAM modulator) and watch it in VLC but it's not too user friendly. I don't know how many users would actually watch our channels on mobile. I have tested Haivison's HMP product and have always wondered if there are competition products to this. Is there anything open source in this space at all?\n    submitted by    /u/woodcake  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So we've been dealing with some issues regarding Spectrum speeds/reliability for awhile now. We're being charged $400 a month for the 50x50 line itself (In the city), along with additional costs for things like a managed firewall. We've had stability issues quite frequently in the past with this line, but the stability seems to be better now. \n 50mb/s is not meeting our needs though. I understand the high cost is to guarantee these minimum speeds, though our speeds don't seem to really ever go above that. A shared line could give us 20 times the speeds for a quarter of the price. I would think that the 50mb/s is a minimum amount of bandwidth we'd get, shouldn't we still be able to get higher speeds despite them not being guaranteed? Or are we being capped at that 50mb mark? It seems like that 50mb/s minimum is our maximum, which seems a bit absurd. I'm not really sure if we're being throttled at that bandwidth. \n If spectrum doesn't throttle dedicated lines at their guaranteed speeds, I suppose another cause may be the managed firewall that we have with them. It seems to be an older model, and from my knowledge it is performing tasks like Deep Packet Inspection. \n We also use a shared building, with 2 other tenants in it. By paying for a dedicated line, would the other tenants in the building be using that line? From the agreement we signed, it looks like there are 3 address entries with the same address, so it seems plausible that we may not be getting that dedicated access, and that this may be a cost we should talk to the landlord about. \n These are the theories I've come up with so far. I understand the value/cost associated with getting dedicated speeds, but it seems like we're pretty much being limited at these speeds.

The company has been upgrading all of the networking equipment for our relatively small on-premise server/domain, but I'm still running into issues with RDP accessed through the client VPN provided through a Cisco Meraki MX64 SD-WAN.\n The RDP/VPN connection seems to struggle mostly with video but it also sometimes drops for no real apparent reason. It's out of my normal scope of work but I've been attempting to troubleshoot down to at least a general root cause.\n After doing quite a few pings/traceroutes/MTRs from the MX64 I've noticed that the ping to the local ISP node (50.46.181.20) seems to spike semi-regularly from very respectable numbers (1-10ms) to strangely much higher numbers (20-40ms). The connection can cope when I'm just doing office work but seems to push latency tests (performed via testmy.net/latency) on my local machine into the 200-300ms on certain video calls.\n I'm not hoping to pin down a specific cause with these tests, but would highly appreciate any insight into where I should look further.\n Pings to Local Node: https://imgur.com/a/rLRWWAg\n MTR to Local Node: https://imgur.com/a/BughVsE\n Traceroute to Google: https://imgur.com/a/0f9rwWR\n MTR to Google: https://imgur.com/a/OYeO7Iu\n    submitted by    /u/act3297  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm new to RDMA technology, and I'm confused by several rdma libraries. I cannot figure out the relationship among them. The libraries and kernel headers I'm confused with are as follows: \n 1.rdma-core/libibverbs\n 2.rdma-core/librdmacm\n 3.linux-5.4.2/include/rdma\n 4.linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi/rdma\n My question is: \n 1.As far as I know. libibverbs provides the userspace applications with verbs api(i.e. functions with prefix ibv_), but it does not offer any connection-related functions, so applications need to exchange connection information using sockets(I see this operation in the libibverbs example rc_pingpong.c). librdmacm provides the user with easier connection management mechanism(e.g. rdma_get_cm_event). However, it seems that librdmacm does more work than connection management, since it also defines several apis(e.g. rdma_create_qp in rdma_cma.h) which looks similar to the ibv_function in libibverbs. So I do not know whether librdmacm is a superset of libibverbs? If not, what's the relationship between them?\n 2.In the example rc_pingpong.c of libibverbs, I cound see it includes the header file verbs.h, and it seems that linux-5.4.2/include/rdma and linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi do not play any role in the program(no heaer files in these two directories are included). So what are the header files in these two directories aimed at? \n I have refer to several materials but have not made it clear. Any explanation or related resources are well-appreciated.

What do you think about out of band (SIM CARD or wifi based(?) ) console servers - theoretically sounds very good - how about the practice ?\n Also there're some other requirements we would like to have:\n  \nminimum of 16 interfaces\n possibility to use RJ45 to RJ45 UTP cables for simplicity and longer range cross-rack connectivity (than simple Cisco console cables).\n Continuing from 2 - the device should be able to rollover programmatically that cable (also - how this function is called - (software selectable pins) ?). Because manually changing pins from straight through to rollover in UTP cable from standard is not very sustainable solution. In Ethernet world similar thing is called auto-mdix - it's interesting how this thing is called in serial world :)\n  \nAny suggestions ?

Another fun fact about this network is that the original designer tagged Vlan 1 on all uplink ports. Of course Vlan 1 is still also the default & native vlan throughout the network. Our main data subnet, cameras and door controls are all on Vlan 1 across the entire company.\n The project requirement is to implement department vlans at our main site and have a few other vlans at other remote sites as needed. Of course they want to move the cameras off the data subnet and also use vlans for IOT, printers, and a few other departments at some sites.\n Our WAN is connected using AT&T Metro ASE Layer 2. We have an Aruba 3810 L3 Switch as the gateway at each site. IP Routing is enabled on each of these L3 Switches.\n We have 12 remote sites, STP is in use at each site, but we only connect using static routes. No ospf, rip, bgp, etc.\n My initial thought is to first install all of the new subnets/vlans throughout the network. Then slowly begin moving the Vlan 1 devices over to the new subnets. We have a server team that will handle most of the systems that will need their IP changed so my main task is to ensure connectivity.\n How would you handle moving users off of Vlan 1 onto the new subnets?

Cisco ASA router managing DHCP > 16-port dumb switch > 4 port switch(es)\n https://imgur.com/a/nrG2JcM for a basic network diagram\n Had an issue where *out of nowhere, after years of this setup* the Cisco ASA got flooded with 169.254 addresses and killed the network. \n I know what you're thinking - why the f*** do you have such cheap dumb ass unmanaged networking equipment for a 30 user environment? Because we're cheap and stupid and have no money. Believe me I've tried. I don't want to go any further into my thoughts in case of this post being found to be honest, but it is not a favourable position I am in.\n Anyways,\n I figured there was maybe a network loop happening, with this being just as the office was closing I got everyone to leave and I powered everything off. I determined that 1 small switch with 2 computers hanging off it was tripping the network when powered back on. The other switches/computers were repowered and are OK.\n The 2 computers appear fine, like I have pretty detailed software inventories using our endpoint protection agent, and indeed plugging the laptops in elsewhere, no issue.\n This is where I am out of diagnosis, knowledge, experience and wit. So I guess I can blame the switch being worth about $10, but why would it be spamming 169.254 addresses?\n I have now plugged the \"faulty\" switch in elsewhere and it no longer trips the network. Has this been a red herring all along?\n Moral of story is - we need better equipment so I can actually see which ports/devices these addresses were coming from. But I am still in the sad situation where I cannot properly explain the outage, so hoping for ideas.\n ***Disclaimer. I bring this post with great humility, regret and pleading forgiveness. Yes, it is barely an amateur setup for a business turning over millions of $. Just trying to get by.\n    submitted by    /u/saladnicoise  \n [link]   [comments]",

The tech tested the signals with an expensive looking tool and determined the signals coming in were good. At one point, he did indicate we could remove the splitter without issue. But, them he tested it again before proceeding and noticed an issue. \n The way the tech explained it was if we remove the splitter, we would gain 5dB somewhere, but then lose 5dB somewhere else which would push past a certain threshold that would cause sync issues. Im not even sure it was dB, but I have to assume. He wasnt great at talking smart and I wasnt great at knowing what he was talkinh about. Im not an expert in coax cable signaling and understanding readings.

Some are simple, some more elaborate, but all of the ones above are really designed for Developers - the syntax highlighting supports only programming and scripting languages, really. \n I was wondering if any of you guys who are network engineers and also mac users have an app that would serve well as a snippet manager with syntax highlighting for Cisco, Juniper and other network config formats? \n I'm currently using MacVim with vim-wiki plugin, and it works reasonably well, but I would like something with a bit more structure, where I can more easily search through and look for notes / config snippets. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/frozen-geek  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I've got a branch office that was previously sending Internet traffic to the ISP and local office subnet over an IPsec tunnel w/ bgp. The plan now is to send local subnet traffic AND all internet traffic over this tunnel (in this case, the other end is Prisma cloud, but scenario should be the same if it was the HQ) This is my first time sending all traffic over the tunnel, so the routing intricacies escape me a bit. \n https://imgur.com/a/jYJZweo A scribble diagram to help visualize and give better detail.\n ​\n So initially, changing the next hop for 0.0.0.0/0 to Tunnel.1 would bring the office completely down. My understanding now is that it's basically trying to send the IKE and ESP traffic etc over a tunnel that doesn't exist yet.\n ​\n So I've done a little bit of research and it sound like I have to have a static route that goes to the ISP still, but at a lower priority:\n 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop eth1.4 172.0.0.2 (isp) Priority 15\n for the IKE/ESP traffic for tunnel creation.\n ​\n Then have another route for all other traffic (local subnet and Internet) with a higher priority, so local office traffic flows as before and so Internet traffic can pass to Prisma/HQ for inspection.\n 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop tunnel.1 Priority 10\n ​\n The tunnel traffic is also using BGP, the traffic to the ISP is not.\n ​\n Any insight and/or corrections welcome!

          "description": "I posted this to the CCNP subreddit but got no response, hope it's okay to ask here.\n I'm reading the OCG CCNP book and I'm a little confused at its explanation of how BPDU filter works when enabled globally. Here's what it says:\n \"The global BPDU filter configuration uses the command spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default, and the port sends a series of 10 to 12 BPDUs. If the switch receives any BPDUs, it checks to identify which switch is more preferred.\n ■ The preferred switch does not process any BPDUs that it receives, but it still transmits BPDUs to inferior downstream switches.\n ■ A switch that is not the preferred switch processes BPDUs that are received, but it does not transmit BPDUs to the superior upstream switch\"\n My understanding is that when BPDU filter is configured globally it applies to all portfast ports and if a port receives a BPDU it converts to a regular STP port. Applied at the interface and it basically stops the port from participating in STP. \n I feel like it's just explaining regular STP operation but I'm confused by the wording.\n    submitted by    /u/BookooBreadCo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There is currently a rule on the Cisco ASA 5555 that allows HTTPS traffic to the FQDN xyz.com (example) for server. The connection once works and once does not work. I was able to determine that the public FQDN resolves to a lot of public IPs from different subnets. The ASA does not always have the IP address in the DNS cache to which the FQDN on the server was resolved. Server and the ASA have exactly the same DNS server set up. Unfortunately, I am unable to obtain a complete list of the IP addresses of the subnets to which the FQDN is resolved, so traffic needs to be filtered to FQDN. I have noticed that the FQDN on the server changes every 30-40 seconds or so, and on the ASA in the DNS cache I see a TTL for the FQDN of up to 2 minutes. Does anyone have any idea how to solve this so that in the DNS cache on the ASA the FQDN address is always the same as on the server? I know that the server first resolves the FQDN and then with the IP address it gets from DNS it goes to ASA. The ASA must have there the IP address to which the FQDN on the server was resolved.\n    submitted by    /u/puttymonster  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the same vein, I can use Netmiko (CLI via SSH) or NAPALM (HTTP API) when using Python/Nornir.\n Our monitoring tools make extensive use of SNMP.

Apparently they cover construction costs as well up to 10K for dedicated lines but not sure what's involved. Does this look on par with typical dedicated business fiber rates? If we have a Business Fan account with cellular lines, can you somehow get a package or deal of some sort when adding fiber? I heard there were some sort package deals with fiber, but unsure if it applies to dedicated or just residential. Also, would it be possible to ask them or the 3rd party contractor to lay OS2 single mode cable (vs cat6) as it's more future proof?

I had to swap out two line cards (a 10/40 gbps ethernet module and a 1/10 gbps module.)\n Both modules are green and have a status of \"ok.\" The 10/40 gbps module's interfaces came up and I allocated all except one to the proper VDCs; however, the 1/10 module's interfaces do not show in the management VDC or the production VDCs that they were originally assigned to.\n The second issue is that on the 10/40 card, interface 7 unlike the other interfaces on the card, is broken down into subinterfaces eth1/7/1 - eth1/7/4. Eth1/7/1 does not appear when I do a \"show interface status\" and when I try to allocate the other three subinterfaces to a VDC I get this error \"Port allocate not supported on this interface!\"\n Does anybody have an idea of what the cause of these issues are?\n    submitted by    /u/Creative-Building125  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm making active progress towards that goal but know I have a long way to go. \n My question is this, though. What qualifies someone as a Senior Network Engineer? Is it just a title? Is it professional level certifications? Is it years of experience?\n ​\n I know this is a very weighted question and will vary based on opinion, but I'm interested in everyone's opinions. At what point do I know that I've achieved my goal? I'm a life-long learner and will continue to grow, but I have to have reasonable, attainable goals (short-term, long-term, or otherwise). Without them being reasonable/attainable they will forever hang above me like a badge of dishonor and no one wants that.\n ​\n Thanks, guys.

          "description": "Hey all, \n I'm setting up a business 10GbE internal network using a Synology DS1821+ with (8) 16TB 7200 Seagate EXOS drives and two 10GbE RJ45 ports in the rear. This is for a video production company that wants the maximum data throughput to their devices since they frequently edit 4k 120fps uncompressed footage. My plan is to run both 10GbE ports from the Synology to a QNAP QSW M1208-8C through RJ45 to SFP+ adapters, then connect my 8 users to the switch through the remaining (8) RJ-45 ports with Cat6 Cable (all less than 75 foot runs). Additionally, I was planning to connect their modem to the switch using a 1GbE RJ45 to SFP adapter since their current internet speeds are 500/500. \n My current issue is that I can't find a compatible 10GbE or 1GbE adapter that QNAP lists as compatible with the network switch. Would a generic adapter from FS suffice? Is compatibility required?\n My second issue is future expandability. With the NAS and the internet modem taking up of the (3) SFP ports using adapters, the remaining (8) RJ45/SPF combo 10GbE ports are taken up by the (8) users with RJ45 CAT6 cables. Would the smartest move when it's time to expand be to daisy-chain another switch in through the SFP port? Or purchase a new switch that has more ports?\n My third question is regarding bottlenecks. In each of the computers we have PCIE network cards that are rated for at least 5GbE, most 10GbE. Will our bottleneck be the computer connection or the speed of the Synology in RAID 6? Either way we should have plenty of bandwidth for editing 4k/120fps uncompressed, but I want to be getting the maximum throughput possible out of this system. \n Thanks so much in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/USBub  \n [link]   [comments]",

The customer isn't very tech/network savvy, but I've only really dealt with Layer 3 (networking support is more of a side-service our company provides), so I've not had experience trying to connect things over Layer 2. \n My understanding (forgive me for my ignorance) is that Layer 2 only deals with MAC addresses, so it doesn't know how to route anything to do with Layer 3 (e.g. IP addresses). \n Per the Layer 2 vendor, we connected the SonicWALLs to the designated ports on the Layer 2 appliances they installed at each location, but I haven't been able to figure out the appropriate configuration to get the two subnets to talk to each other, if that's even possible.\n Here's a rudimentary diagram of how things are currently connected; basically each SonicWALL is connected to the vendor-provided appliance\n Subnet 192.168.10.0/24 SonicWALL A (Port X2) | Frontier NID (Layer 2) | Frontier NID (Layer 2) | SonicWALL B (Port X3) Subnet 192.168.12.0/24 \n Since the subnets are separate, I tried setting up a static route on each SonicWALL so that traffic bound for the other office's subnet use the interface that's connected to the Layer 2 devices rather than the default gateway, but it doesn't seem to get through.\n I can try to provide additional information if that would be helpful; I'm just uncertain of what would be relevant here.\n Many thanks for any insight and apologies for my unfamiliarity with this stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/pixel_damage  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello!\n I am not sure if this is right community for my question but maybe someone will be able to comment.\n I am working with 5G enabled technology and I was wondering if there exists any networking device that is compatible with 3GPP release 16 5G network (similar to this https://mikrotik.com/product/chateau_5g_ax but would support rel.16 features). Since release 16 is probably not rolled out by mobile network operators I was wondering if it is even possible to buy rel.16 compatible device in advance. My concerns arise from specific features promised by 3GPP rel.16 for example Integrated Access and Backhaul, CV2X (Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything) which doesnt sound like regular 5G features therefore would require specific modems, right? Another thing is that for example Mikrotik on its product page doesnt even specify specific 3GPP release, only available 5G bands which I think indicates that this release doesnt even matter and this model will be compatible with future versions of 5G. Is that correct?\n I guess my question boils down to - is there any public information from MNO vendors wheter these 3GPP features will even be enabled and if they will be - can I buy hardware for it in advance?\n    submitted by    /u/aaartis1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve got a bit of a decision to make….stay in my current role or move out.\n I have a significant background in networking (17yrs) and transitioned to a leadership position as a manager of the network team at my current company. \n Recently, I was given an opportunity to transition from networking to cloud due to an organizational re-alignment. So I’ve been spending my recent days learning our Cloud platform, Terraform, CI/CD, etc….\n I knew this was going to be a big challenge - but it would come with big opportunities - especially for future growth. It’s been less than a year and things aren’t going great in the role. I have a new leader and everything just feels disorganized and faltering. Our Cloud strategy isn’t strategic and i feel like im fighting against the tide (ex. Let’s migrate everything..Cloud is simple).\n Even the new direction the company is taking has me concerned about its long term viability.\n I have an opportunity to transition back to a Network Manager role with a different company. I love networking!\n My concern…am I making a short term and short sighted move? Cloud is 100% in more demand that networking. Will I look back in 5yrs or 10yrs and kick myself? Should I stick it out at my current company (10yrs seniority) and hope for the best and gain as much experience I can as a Cloud Manager….which isn’t a lot of hands on exposure.\n On the other hand I go into work each day fearing for my job, I’m not happy, and I’m starting to worry that if I wait too long the job market might shift shortly that might result in limited opportunities.\n Looking for the opinion of my peers 😊\n    submitted by    /u/albert00712  \n [link]   [comments]",

In first year we used it as big l2 switch, later we implemented ospf l3outs and became gateway for some networks and now we implemented PBR to selectively forward traffic to PBR firewall. PBR has become game changer for us as security guys no more has to deal with unnecessary chunk of traffic which makes firewall use resources to the limit. Now while http traffic between two servers is being redirected to firewall, logging traffic between same servers forwarded directly by ACI thanks to specific contracts.\n We are thinking on what else we can implement on ACI to make life easier. How do you use ACI?\n    submitted by    /u/boobless24  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I'm inside my LAN using Tailscale I'd like to route traffic to the Zerotier network (192.168.192.0/24) via the mac mini.\n I'm guessing I should setup a static route, pointing traffic going to the destination network 192.168.192.0/24 through the LAN device on 192.168.5.142 (the mac mini), but do I need to do something on the mac mini to make this work?\n    submitted by    /u/goodyear77  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, the loss is a bit high (no link possible) so we wanted to try 1550nm which of course has better attenuation figures, but I can’t locate any QSFP28 100G modules operating at 1550nm??\n Funnily enough though I have found posts in this subreddit with people saying that at 80KM all DWDM modules will be 1550nm - but the exact opposite seems to be true.\n The loss over the link appears to be about 23-26dBm according to our 10G 1650nm 80KM modules, so I’d expect at 1310 it’s closer to 36db of loss.\n I assume the recommendation would be EDFA, but any other suggestions for reliable 100G over this link would be appreciated :)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/TryTurnItOffAndOnAgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm in a bind to look for an elegant solution to get the following failover solution working and I wondered if anyone here might have any ideas? \n Diagram as follows : Diagram \n Simple two site setup with both sites having their own WAN link for internet as well as site to site connectivity. \n The MPLS wans are setup with eBGP so each Cisco router receives the prefix of the other site via that WAN link for reachability to each other. \n The LANs of both routers are setup with two subnets and are setup using VRRP. with each router acting as the active VRRP group for each subnet: \n Site1 : 192.168.1.254\n Site2 : 192.168.0.254\n VRRP is setup so in the event of the WAN going down the other router takes over as VRRP master. \n This means that as well as resilience that both WAN links are fully utilised instead of all traffic just using the one WAN link. All good! \n The issue is that due to the point to point interface and VRRP that if the point to point dies so site1 can no longer reach site2 using the point to point that you would want that traffic to go out via the WAN into the MPLS to reach the other site. \n The problem is of course it won't do that due to each of the Cisco routers having LAN's which belong to both subnets. So if traffic was going from Site1 to Site2 then as soon as those packets destined for 192.168.0.0/24 hit the Site1 router then it would just not send it out's its WAN as it has an interface belonging to that subnet which is up and part of the VRRP group. \n This is the problem I'm trying to solve. A solution which I don't like is to create a EMM script which will shut down that LAN in the event traffic is no longer using the P2P but I don't like how messy that could be. \n Anyone got any ideas or suggestions then I'm open to them :) \n I hope that made at least some sense?\n    submitted by    /u/Busbyuk  \n [link]   [comments]",
