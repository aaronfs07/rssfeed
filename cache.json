In the course of incident response activities, CISA determined that cyber threat actors exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server, installed XMRig crypto mining software, moved laterally to the domain controller (DC), compromised credentials, and then implanted Ngrok reverse proxies on several hosts to maintain persistence.

          "description": "Hi All\n Further to my post about using Azure/365 non licensed users. I am wondering if there is also a 3rd party provider that can link to various identity providers to be the single source of identity so we can then point SSO/Saml config from the various saas provders instead of azure.\n A comment has been made, that they want to keep out tenant as clean as possible, eg only users with licenses and have access to company resources and equipment to reduce risk. This will likely be 300 users in next few years. But overall staff could be 5000+. Of the 5000+ , they wont have email acct, nor equipment but do need access to like HR Saas portals etc.\n Personally, I think its going to be cheaper to just give everyone a basic 365 license that inc some form of email and can control the MFA part of the identity provider. But business wants alternatives as they know as soon as I enable email, I will be going, headocount, headcount (not that I said I can turn the email part off).\n I am thinking like of Okta etc but wanted ot ask here first.\n    submitted by    /u/slewis_1972  \n [link]   [comments]",

As being great options \n There's only a few concerns/requirements I'm looking for.\n  \nPre-windows login auth to domain servers for new user authentication\n Saved credentials that can be used with said pre-windows login\n And multiple gateway options for fail over to redundant ISPs\n  \nFor requirement #1,2 we have a few branch offices with a decent amount of turn over so new users are always signing in and out of the domain'd pc so a saved set of VPN credentials that user's can't see and don't need to be reentered for an employee to authenticate to the DC to is a must\n We currently use Watchguard fireboxes with IPsec clients as they allow prelogin auth with saved creditials, but my only gripe is that the VPN client doesn't allow for multiple gateway options with out making a new profile, that users have to swap to and sign in again on. (The VPN client has to swap gateways on its own as I don't trust my users to toggle to the back up, and to toggle back to the primary when connection is stable again.) \n I'm hesitant at the Cisco option as I don't have much Cisco CLI expertise.\n We have about 25-35 VPN endpoints at any given time. \n We are a full windows org and only IT uses VPN on phones (mainly to just test if the VPN connection is working)\n    submitted by    /u/BOF007  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or am I over complicating things.\n I have created a complicated powershell script so far that does alot of prechecks (network,diskspace,homedrive space required, etc) but this actual lift and shift part just gets more complicated when I look into the nitty grity bits.\n    submitted by    /u/the_star_lord  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since i’m relying on Aruba to host my customer websites and email server (talking about imap/pop ofc), i would like to move to a vps to increase the income and to simplify my management work. I started looking at OVH but i need a “lot” of storage because my customers want a lot of GB per email address and on OVH to obtain more than 160gb i need to pay for the 8core/8gb ram vps that i don’t need (i can’t consider the option to add a secondary partition because cpanel can’t officially store email on another partition). So i started looking at A2Hosting, the “Lift 16 Vps” makes more sense for me since it has 450gb storage so i can fulfill the customer needings about email capacity. The exchange server is not a viable option due to costs. I would like to hear opinions about a2hosting, if someone has better ideas than mine and if cpanel has some sort of problems on multi-hosting that i didn’t consider.

Absolutely hate the things!\n In an environment where your place cannot ship goods without the printed labels, it is a bit of a showstopper!\n We use Zebra printers at site, quite a number of them, printing various labels from SAP, so they often have to be specific printers for each label type. These are types such as 110Xi4's, 220Xi4's, ZD500's and ZT610's. \n A long while back, I made some suggestions around purchasing maintenance for them but this cost and idea wasn't being entertained. So at the time, looked at purchase a spare of each printer type so in the event of failure, we can roll out a new printer immediately, minimising disruption and downtime. We went with this idea and knowing it could be months before replacement printer would arrive as lead times are about 3 months now. Obviously this was long ago now and spare is in use. \n So today, printer seems to have a mechanical fault, is out of warranty and Zebra don't really want to know. I'd sent them a video displaying fault and they now recognise it as being mechanical fault and needs a visit, but they ask me to contact a partner for this!\n Being the only IT guy about the place, this ultimately falls to me. I'm an IT guy yes, but I am not a printer engineer. We have our limits but it doesn't half stress me out when these things go down.\n It honestly felt as though I was doing same thing over and over again with the printer and expecting a different result.

And of recent I was put in a situation to meet up with a termed employee at our offices on a Saturday when no one is there. I have drawn the line here and documented my concerns in an email to HR and management. Thanks for the reassurance that I am making the right decision here stepping up to management.\n    submitted by    /u/j0nwayne  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was working on the server recently to install a TPM chip to have BitLocker setup and come to my surprise; I didn't see a RAID controller; and then I went into Disk Management and confirmed my suspicion. \n Disk 1: 500 GB: for OS\n Disk 2: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive\n Disk 3: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive\n Disk 4: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive\n Disk 5: 2TB Unused (Empty) \n https://imgur.com/a/Y46NSS7\n Server is PowerEdge R540 128 GB Memory / Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz \n Client has about 7 VMs being ran on this span of 3 hard drives. Fortunately all together the total amount of data being used is just a bit over 1 TB and we have Offsite backups running. Client doesn't know this yet. \n I want to look into getting a hard RAID Controller for the server and get RAID setup. Should I go for a RAID 5 and move the DATA off the D: Drive to the unused Disk on DISK 5? Or setup the server to do have a RAID 10 configuration for the DATA Drive?\n Also it bothers me that the OS is just sitting on a single drive with no redundancy as well. I was thinking of doing a RAID 1 for that.\n How would you go through and handle this issue and prevent as minimum downtime as possible to get this s*** fixed?\n    submitted by    /u/TeachRound  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not too long ago, the email server market was spread across lots of different mail server products: Exchange (of course), Axigen, Ipswitch Imail, Kerio, Lotus Domino, MDaemon, Postfix, Neon Insight, Qmail, Sendmail, Smartermail, Sun Messaging server, Zimbra, Communigate, Mailenable and many others. Now, it seems, in the corporate space, due to the appeal of Microsoft's vast product suite, most companies have moved or will be moving to Microsoft 365. Question: Is this setup healthy? This might be exaggeration, but in years to come, since all data will be housed and managed by one company (Microsoft), will we even need the SMTP protocol?\n    submitted by    /u/poobear_74  \n [link]   [comments]",

We recently won a contract to distribute specialized network switches nationally but the catch is that we now directly take over the warranties and our current system is not suitable for the now large amount of RMAs we have to process and track. I have been asked to evaluate Snipe-IT as an alternative system before we spend a small fortune developing new Asset Management Software.\n I have played around with the demo and while It will easily address most of our needs the only way I can see us using it to track assets that have come back for an RMA is by creating a new status or duplicating a location and adding a suffix (example, having \"Location A\" and \"Location A-RMA area\"). However, due to their high volume, we want to treat the faulty switches as an entirely separate beast, in order to make end of month reporting easier.\n    submitted by    /u/Hugs_Happy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The backend is serving HTTP on 9801 but is also serving websockets on port 3000. A user visiting the site enters the domain https://foo.com, gets taken to the varnish box and views the site, where the site javascript then tells it to connect to websockets on wss://foo.tld:3000, but it can't connect. There are lots of solutions for setups where varnish is running on the same localhost as the backend that it's serving, but this one seems to be a problem. My VCL includes the standard req.http.upgrade -> return pipe with the connect headers copied, and it worked with our previous frontend proxy that was on a different CDN, and I suspect the old CDN was playing a part in making the websocket connections work.\n How do I get varnish to pick up the client connection for WSS on 3000 and pass it transparently back and forth to a remote backend that is running WS also on 3000?

Obviously it's an incredible offer, and I'm delighted to get it. My boss says that he wants to make me a similar offer, but it's going through the quagmire of the company HR department and nothing concrete has materialised after about a week. The new company needs to know by the end of this week whether I'm accepting.\n Not counting new job fear (in which I hope I'm not alone, and everyone here has from time to time!), the big thing for me is that company policy says I'd need to be in the office at least 2 days a week. I currently do the majority of drop offs and pick ups for my little girl (who's 3), which is possible due to my WFH schedule. The commute to the new job would be about 40 minutes each way, so days that I worked, I wouldn't be able to do the nursery run.\n My new prospective boss says that in his team, he's super open to being flexible with WFH, so it may not even be this much. I'm just.... Hesitant. I know that it's because of my WFH lifestyle that I'm used to - I guess I'm just wondering, how do I get over this fear? Have any of you made a similar transition?\n    submitted by    /u/OrdosDeluxe  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was my first truly oh shit moment. Took down the company for 3 hours. Today I got sometime to go back and start looking at the issue . The password for the krbtgt account has not been reset in about 8 years. When I run the klist command it shows AES-256 connection from and to every machine I have looked at. The only exceptions is the krbtgt and our QNAP device. QNAP will be something I look at afterwards. We have an old one and are talking about replacing it the first of the year so I don't want to spend too much time there. Anyhow, my thinking is it is still using RC4 because that was the last time the account had its password reset and to move it up to AES-256 the password needs to be reset. \n ​\n Can anyone confirm if my thinking is right?\n I've been told by multiple people that resetting the password for the krbtgt account has not caused any problems.

Then User2 comes in to start their day logs into a Windows 10 PC which is domain joined and receives \"Welcome User1\" in the windows login greeting and User1 is then disconnected from their RDS session and User2 has actually loaded User1's profile - desktop icons and all.\n Any ideas what may be causing this, I have tried the following:\n -Removed User1 and User2's profiles from the Windows 10 PC and then re-added only User2 back on to the device but the issue is still occurring - User 1 no longer uses the Windows 10 PC just works on the RDS.\n -Removed the Windows 10 PC from the domain and re-joined to the domain. The RDS server itself is new only a month or two old has been happening ever since the RDS server was setup I was informed.\n any further suggestions on what else we can try here? - getting close to the too much time wasted - blow away windows and reinstall and see if it happens again.\n    submitted by    /u/savijNizl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a self-serving post where I am patting my own back, but I don't care. I'm happy.\n We rate people on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest. Once a manager rates their employees, they need to justify the rating to senior management, who almost always challenge the rating, especially when it's a 4 or a 5. So, my manager is meeting with senior management and tells them he's giving me a 5, and they just say \"We're good with that. Who's next.\"\n After that, he tells me what an outstanding job I do. How my troubleshooting skills are god-tier, at times. How somehow I seem to be available 24x7, and on and on.\n Honestly, I don't think I am all that exceptional. I MIGHT spend 15-20 minutes after hours responding to emails from people. And I usually stay VPNed in till the VPN times out at 8:00 PM and kicks me off. If someone needs something done and it takes 5 minutes, I just go do it, because I am already VPNed in and I don't want to deal with it in the morning.\n So, in a month, I don't work that much overtime. But when I am sitting in bed and watching something on my iPad and I see an email pop up where someone is asking for something simple, I'll just reply and tell them I can deal with it in the morning.\n So, this really is the ILLUSION of putting in an insane amount of after hours work. When it's really just me responding to an email now and then. As an old boss told me: carry your Blackberry on you at all times (this was the 2000s). 99% of the time, you'll never be bothered. But that one time someone calls you and you answer, you're everyone's hero. And they'll remember you're the guy who answered the phone when there was a problem.\n It's good to be recognized sometimes.\n    submitted by    /u/plazman30  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking for more impartial opinions than I've been given so far.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/YeahProbablyPotato  \n [link]   [comments]",

Like, if the server is down right now, I can figure outa way to get it back up. I might not be able to articulate how, but I’ll get it running again. But ask me to troubleshoot what happened after the fact and I’ll flounder. Similarly if you give me a bunch of machines and an end result, I can get them running… but are they configured correctly, or do they just “kinda work”?\n The second is I really have a hard time working hard enough or doing the work I need to be doing. If I don’t have a person calling now, I try to go to my ticket queue, and I can sit and stare at tickets or click in and out of them multiple times without doing anything.

The hack is to add a new REG_BINARY to the registry key below (create if does not exist):\n [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\MMStuckRectsLegacy]\n The name of this new value must be the device instance path (second property when navigating to Devices Manager > Monitors > (target monitor name) > Properties > Device Instance Path).

(No, seriously, it's very pleasant and to the point).\n But within the next week, she will disappear from her team. \n If it matters, this user was an active member of the organization back in 2019, left to have a baby, and just came back this past month. Her account was never removed. Her sign-in was rescinded and her mailbox was set to shared. When she got rehired, we just re-issued her a Business Standard License and set her mailbox back up. \n But every Monday, when she opens her teams app, it shows her as \"not a member\" of any teams, and she's not permitted to join any unless I go through the admin portal and do it. \n ​\n What could I be missing?

What I was not prepared for is that Veeam is actually charging a fee to migrate you from the Socket Model to the VUL Model. This fee is as much as my renewal. In what world does this make sense? We want to move folks to our new VUL (which will increase me $2K per year on its own) but we are going to make their renewal cost double to do it? So, you want me to pay a fee to pay you more? You would think they would SAVE you money year 1 to get you into the new model. I'm no rocket scientist, but what idiot approved this or thought this would fly with customers?\n I know Veeam is the best, blah blah blah, but this was a kick straight to the face and honestly is disgusting that they think this is acceptable.

I can generally replicate it by going File -> Open, open any file, then go File -> Save As and immediately I get the dialog box with the above message. Once it resolves (after up to a minute) and the document saves it doesn't occur again for a period of time. To me that smacks of DNS but I can resolve the share via Windows Explorer or by doing an nslookup at any time before or after opening and saving and it resolves with no issues.\n Environment is Windows Server 2019 on premises Active Directory running two DCs in Hyper-V VMs on two different physical hosts. I'm running DFS Namespace with both DCs listed under Namespace servers. Less than 50 clients. Clients are all Windows 10 with two Windows 11 machines connected via either wireless or gigabit ethernet. Addresses are assigned via DHCP and both DCs are the only DNS servers assigned. Office applications range from 2016 to 365.\n It must be DNS (even when it isn't lol) but I confess I'm not sure where to go from where or how else to troubleshoot. If you can access a share immediately via Windows Explorer, or have nslookup return an immediate correct result, what else is left? And yet the problem still occurs to the point that people are getting visibly frustrated.\n    submitted by    /u/ardaingeal  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone of r/sysadmin, I’m a young up and comer in the IT world and not even a sysadmin, been doing this for 2 years now. My journey started off at a local technical school where I was taught the basics of IT and networking, from there I got my A+, Net+ and CCNA. \n Fast forward to today, and I find myself in a nice helpdesk position with a lot of downtime that in 5 months I have been able to completely study and pass my ms-203, my Sec+ as well as the ms-100 and now looking at the ms-101 as well as the company is paying for a course for my az-104. \n Well, as I have been doing these I have been looking around at jobs because well, helpdesk isn’t my goal, I love working with the MS cloud suite and would love to get into a position where working with that stuff is my main responsibility, but everywhere I look, I may have some of the requirements, a lot of place are asking for many more years of experience, but the one thing I’m seeing most is that darned piece of paper I don’t have. A degree. \n So that brings me to my question for you guys, if you have a degree, when did you get yours? I’m only 23 myself and kind of figure there’s no reason I shouldn’t just do it, and I was looking and a lot of the courses for an Associates in Cloud Architecting are for certs I already have, so I would think it would be a cakewalk.\n    submitted by    /u/KeredEkralc  \n [link]   [comments]",

In my work I touched each part of the stack from hardware to Linux and Windows administration, to networking, monitoring, alerting, databases, webservers, data analysis and report building using SQL, troubleshooting issues involving many moving parts, log management, writing custom instruments in python, AWS, CI/CD, docker, incident resolution involving many people, so in general I’m quite familiar with modern Sysadmin and DevOps practices.\n It might look like a tremendous overkill for what I’m looking for, but right now my ability to work is quite limited, so I’m looking for small jobs involving server support and troubleshooting and some log and data analysis, which won’t take much of my time, but I can be oncall and available to fix issues on the need-to basis, and I can provide 24//7 coverage for critical infrastructure, first setting up some infrastructure for projects which concerns alerting and availability practices.\n I also did some mentoring for my friends concerning networking, linux, basic programming and server administration, because I like doing it. I even once wrote a Linux tutorial.\n I’m sure there should be demand for this and people would be interested in paying some monthly fee for someone skilled for looking after their stuff, but I don’t really know how to find it, because I’m used to working full-time in large companies. I tried but had no luck with Upwork for this, and I would like to learn places where I can find such gigs or talk to people and network.\n Thank you for your time.\n P.S.

When the client times out, the session disconnects but will reconnect immediately and try over and over again, spamming Azure MFA. \n On two occasions now, Push Notifications have just stopped working. I can’t get it to work again. I’ve removed the Authenticator device from the security portal, but when I go to add it back it fails (have tried via sign-in in the app as well which works), but still no push notifications. I have also checked blocked users in the multifactor authentication blade, but the account is not listed there.\n The only way I’ve found to get push notifications to work again, is to delete and recreate the 365 user, which is of course not ideal. \n Has anyone experienced the issue with Push notifications being blocked?

That's literally it. No other changes were made.\n Shortly after, I started to be unable to RDP into any of our on-prem Win2008/R2 servers or any Win7 machines that were domain-joined. If I try with Win10 mstsc, I get \"Your credentials did not work (the login attempt failed)\"\n If I try using RDP on the Win2022 DC, I get \"An internal error has occurred. Error code 0x4, extended error code 0x0.\"\n The hilarious bit is I can RDP into an on-prem WinXP VM sitting on a VMware hypervisor, and RDP from there to any of the on-prem machines I'm having trouble with. I can also RDP into any domain-joined VMs in Azure.\n I am completely stumped. Initially I thought NLA settings might somehow have changed on the on-prem servers, but I just checked one and it's set for lax NLA.\n Event viewer shows NOTHING. No persistent DFSR issues, nothing.\n dcdiag comes back clean on all DCs aside from irrelevant System log entries.\n UPDATE: It just started happening to the Azure DC as well, but it told me it was NLA, so I went and set SecurityLayer and UserAuthentication keys to 0 at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp using Remote Registry, and voila, I can now log on to an affected server.\n Obviously I'd prefer not to leave NLA off, any idea what might be causing this?\n    submitted by    /u/distractal  \n [link]   [comments]",

Windows could not resolve the computer name...\"\n DNS appears to be fine, and the computers are able to ping the DC's, and the domain itself with no issue.

          "description": "I swear I have tried to search for hits on this topic (here on Reddit and also via Google) and keep coming up empty. I have a situation in which a company is asking me how much I would charge them to have my certification status registered under them. Basically, they need someone in their corporate account that is holding three different technical certifications that I have or can get fairly easily (all three certs are very much my main focus in IT for the past 15+ years.). A friend of mine has told me that a colleague we both have in common will often do this for 5K for a 12 month agreement. I have heard of even higher numbers, which is mind boggling to me. But, as my friend explained, because incentives and sales discounts are often predicated on what status a company holds with a major vendor, these expenses of borrowing someone's certification status will often pay for themselves in very short time. I guess I am simply trying to understand what is reasonable based on the experience of others in here. Also, anything I should think about before agreeing to do this?

And with large amount, I mean roughly 700GB which I know some of you probably laugh about, but for our company that is the limit and my employer does not want to just buy more memory and I have to somehow make room for new data right now. The data right now is stored on a terminal server within a cloud and I don't know their price models but apparently it is kinda expensive to upgrade memory i guess.\n I have never engaged with data storage, backups or archiving before so I have no experience. We have the options of theoretically buying and installing our own backup server as we still have a lot of room in our server rack. Alternatively we could use some cloud option but I have the feeling that we would pay too much for something very simple. \n Also which OS would you use to make it simple and efficient?

Currently I use PaaS software like Heroku for all of them, but it's getting expensive.\n How much work is it to maintain and secure a web server running for example multiple indie Ruby on Rails apps with Postgres?\n What if the data is sensitive? \n Should I just pony up the $$ for a PaaS (often paid per project, which is the painpoint for me), or is it worth keeping my own server to be able to run basically infinite hobby projects on (unless they start scaling, but then I can always deal with that?).\n Back in 2005-ish I used to run and maintain a few servers on Hetzner (I'm in Europe). They just had my personal stuff, so I didn't stress too much about security, but tried to keep them semi up-to-date with aptitude (although I was quite often behind) and lately also using SSH keys. I don't know much more than that about running a server, to be honest, but I'm willing to learn if it's not too much work.\n    submitted by    /u/Daniel_SJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

But often people forget to do it.\n We do not have such thing for when an employee leaves though. Not yet at least.\n ​\n My initial idea, was to add some sort of information message to managers, when I run my user disabling script.\n Or make some sort of formular, where it will send out an e-mail containing some basic information of the person quitting, so that it will trigger some script that will then run all the basics, and inform all the relevant people.\n Preferably a way where no one has to remember anything specific, other than maybe click a button.\n ​\n But I am not trying to get a discussion going on how bad we handle it, instead I am trying to get some ideas from other people in the same field.

The seniors “co-workers” just don’t want you to learn and mess around with their stuff even if you are doing it alright and actually helping them, even if you are hired to do system tasks, they throw you back on the helpdesk pit for the d2d, because “you are more experienced with that” and you'll endup doing something actual worth doing maybe once in a couple of weeks.\n And let me ask you, how should I be more experienced if you do not give me a proper task or a chance to learn and do some actual work on a corporate environment, even if I do correctly everything you ask so far no matter how big the task was?\n Is it too much to ask?

I check access logs, nothing other than his mobile and their IP. OK, not that then.\n I ring him up and say turn your computer on and I'll have a look. Turns out he didn't turn his computer off, just closed Outlook. Whatever.\n I open up Outlook, and check his inbox. Sure enough, emails are disappearing really quickly!\n OK, maybe he's accidentally archived emails newer than 1 second or something? Nope, no archives.\n OK I check his deleted folder to see if they're going there, and there they are - only they're being deleted there too!!!\n I check another folder, WHOA! they're being deleted there as well!\n What about Online? SAME!!! OH CRAP!!!!!! I'm thinking quickly. What could it be???\n Maybe it's a rule? OK I'll check that. I open up the rules, and I struggle to do anything. It won't let me click.\n It's then that I notice that the tabs across the top are flashing as though someone's got tab pressed. So I call the customer, and say \"is something on your keyboard???\"\n He gives it a thump, and suddenly, emails stop deleting. It was his keyboard, the delete (and possibly Tab) key was stuck or are faulty.\n Overall, it wasn't a long time - about 20 minutes. But I feel like I only thought of the solution because of Silicon Valley:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDK8tMyCic\n Turns out, 15 folders and over 10,000 items got deleted.

In addition, inbound mail will still go through Mimecast prior to being delivered to EXO.\n Since we are a small team, we engaged with an MSP to provide a quote to do some of the migration. They provided a \"get your tenant configured to best practices and migrate data\" quote in the six figure range. That seems very high to me based on the scope of work provided. \n Those of you who have done this migration, is it six-figures difficult? Also is the use of BitTitan (or similar) really necessary or can the built in migration tools do the job just as well?

Why should she have to submit a ticket every time there's a problem when her desk is right outside the data closet where the IT guy sits??? She's \"special\" so she shouldn't have to use that damned ticketing system.\n I tried to calm her, I explained the importance of a ticketing system, and after 30 minutes or so, she finally came around and now I think the IT guy owes me a drink at the next Christmas party....\n It is always good to get the end users perspective from time to time, and more importantly, the ability to explain things in a way that doesn't end with me sleeping on the couch!\n    submitted by    /u/hagermanr  \n [link]   [comments]",

New hires, terminations, title changes, department moves, etc. \n Does your company have a real HRIS? Not some spreadsheet Karen put together, but a publicly purchasable platform? It probably has an API. It could even have web hooks. \n Take the time, if you have the coding chops or someone in the company does, to set up a connection to that API and monitor employee changes. \n Billy gets fired and the HRIS gets updated? Automatic email to the IT ticket system. Becky gets hired? Automatic email to the ticket system. Andy changes job titles? IT probably needs to change security groups, distribution groups, and update AD properties. Guess what. Automated email to the ticket system. Jenn stays in the same position but changes supervisors? You guessed it, email to the ticket system. Heather went on FMLA and needs a temporary revocation of access? Believe it or not, automatic email to the ticket system. \n There are no more late notifications, as long as HR is on the ball. You are eliminating the weak link- humans remembering they need to tell IT. \n Even if you can't do it in house, hire someone. Your ROI is huge. Customer service improves. Visibility improves. Metrics on time to delivery become meaningful. \n HR doesn't have an HRIS?

After that I had a short stint as a manager and got back in to infrastructure.\n I would assume my work at the MSP was/is very similar to what consultants do. At the MSP our sales guys would sell some equipment and I'd go in, figure out what they have, how to make it better (or more secure) and deploy the equipment. I assume consultants focus on the middle part, figuring out what you have and make suggestions for improvement. \n I am by no means an expert but a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" type. Really, I know how to google stuff. I don't have certs. I learn enough about a system to get it to work how I need it to and then move on.\n I believe this would be mostly network related consulting. I don't have many details yet. \n Anyways, I told him I was interested but not sure what to expect or even know what I should be paid or if there's anything I should do to protect myself. \n Any advice would be much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Mi-willy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there an easy way to block through Intune or another method that I can deploy to the endpoints?\n One issue I find is that many devices have already connected to these networks and it would be nice to configure them differently instead of dealing with 100 blocks and network issue tickets the moment that would be enabled. One solution I thought of was to deploy a script that flipped all the networks to Public through the DWORD in the registry under all previously connected networks.\n This feels like a dumb question, so anything is helpful but let me know if I am being dumb and there is a better way to handle this (such as configuring the way private networks are handled)...\n    submitted by    /u/Wet_Humpback  \n [link]   [comments]",

HR is putting on the pressure, as they said they'll have to pay them from their promised start date, even if they can't technically work yet. Has anyone experienced this problem and know some work arounds?\n Edit: for more context, I'm at a startup that's scaling quite quickly, so this has been an ongoing issue. Especially because we're based in the Netherlands and these new employees are mostly working remote. So I need to first get them delivered to the office, then set them up (MDM, etc), then dispatch to the employees wherever they are. We have a relationship with just one supplier, so always encouraged to go through them. However, seems like this won't be scalable. Good idea to have buffer stock so will use this thread for the next conversation. Also looking into more scalable solutions/platforms that streamline this whole thing. \n Thank you for all the advice. Pray for me! \n    submitted by    /u/totoismydaddy  \n [link]   [comments]",

To collect knowledge from people that are smarter than me.\n Surely some of you have gotten to a point, at which you struggled to solve a certain problem. I noticed, that I often find myself in such scenarios, with no idea on how to address the issue.\n Are there a single or more processes a sysadmin can go through, to solve problems? I am willing and eager to learn, but I cant seem to find the thing I'm looking for. I know that there is no single way to solve all problems, but surely there has to be some kind of approach, to determine what the issue is, right? \n I'll define what I would call a \"process\" using a problem, I've got to solve at the moment. \n I've got VoIP PBX that works like it should, with one exception: the FAX service.\n Since the PBX doesnt send faxes like the old way, it receives an incoming fax , converts the content into a mail and sends the mail to the recipient. This stopped working a few days ago. \n After a little search, I noticed that the mail server doesnt work anymore. The testmail results in an error message. So I changed it to a Google SMTP to check if the function still works, which it does. The testmail is send successfully, but someone never arrives. \n Is there a way to check why my testmail does not arrive, and if yes, how?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Artistic-Throat8754  \n [link]   [comments]",

I figure our home internet has dropped out or there's been a power cut so decide to try and connect to the NAS over the internet anyway.\n Oh. It's up. That's weird. Why is it saying it's disconnected from the Internet then? Ah well, let's login and see what's going on. Enter credentials, enter the MFA code and \"The verification code is incorrect\"\n Um. WTF? Try a couple more times and MFA simply isn't working. There's no other admin account to login to (default admin account is disabled - I'm not a total idiot. Yes, yes I know, exposing NAS to the internet etc etc).\n I get my son, who's at home, to reboot the NAS hoping it's a temporary blip. Nope. Still cannot login as the MFA code isn't working.\n At this point my imagination is running wild and I'm assuming that it's been hacked and the MFA for my admin account has been reset to the hacker's phone. Other normal user accounts (non-MFA) are working. The data is still there, no encrypted files or anything else untoward seems to be going on. So, what the hell? \n I check Synology forums and see posts about the time sync possibly being off but that isn't the case. I'm on the verge of asking my son to press the dreaded Reset button when I have a thought. I have a Active Directory domain at home and a single Zetec mini-PC box acting as DC. This also provides DNS for the home network. It couldn't be that could it? Why would that affect MFA on the NAS? \n I get my son to check if the Zetec box is on. It wasn't. Soon as that was powered up and the DNS services started, MFA started working again. \n Bloody DNS man....\n    submitted by    /u/ginolard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Currently we are using a virtual data room solution that costs $6,000 for 2GB of storage and an additional $2000 per GB, so I am up to $8k annually. That seems really insane to me, and we are likely going to need to increase it to 4GB totaling 10K annually.\n I looked at other cloud storage solution providers, and for example, Box.com's Enterprise plan will allow me to only need to license internal users and all external users are free.\n With that, I could seemingly achieve the same thing for $2500 (5-6 internal users) instead of $8000. Not only that, but it includes unlimited storage as well which is a HUGE selling point to me.\n My use of our current data room solution solely exists to provide company financial files to investors. All that I need is activity audit logging, MFA, and granular permissions. It's used maybe once a year for a month or so during investor rounds, which makes the price tag even more painful.\n While we have SharePoint, I keep SharePoint use to internal only because its confusing to people, permission management is a PITA with external users, and audit reporting is no easy feat. I also want that clear delineation to employees to understand internal and external. I am just saying this so that I am not asked why I don't just use SharePoint for this.\n Is there something missing that I don't understand between the definition of a \"data room\" and just normal cloud storage setup to share with external/guest users?\n If you go look at Citrix ShareFile, theres specifically a data room tier that drops you from unlimited storage to 5GB of storage, and costs $448 a MONTH. Why is that a thing??\n Thanks!\n ​\n Edit: Based on the comments explaining the differences, it seems like we may be using a data room when we don't really need one for our specific purposes. I'll evaluate the other options. Thank you for the clarification!\n    submitted by    /u/Future_Is_Cloud  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We use a Windows 2016 server to run print jobs for our ERP system. All printing is direct - no print servers/sharing involved.\n For the past year, it seems like about 50% of Microsoft's updates breaks our printers. The exact scenario is: post-update, about 90% of the printers will have been defaulted to duplex printing, and about 90% of the printers will be using the generic Microsoft printer driver. (Note that these two groups do not always overlap; sometimes a printer will still have the correct driver, but will have been changed to duplex printing, or vice-versa.) This is not printer or driver specific; it occurs across several different makes/models and drivers.\n Fixing it is a relatively simple, but frustrating process: Just go into each printer's \"Advanced > Printing Defaults...\" and disable duplex. Afterwards, both issues will be resolved.\n We attempted to resolve this with a simple bit of Powershell, set to run (as admin) on system startup:\n  $printers = Get-Printer foreach($printer in $printers){ Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode 'OneSided' } \n However, Set-PrinterConfiguration only works after the printer has been manually fixed. Otherwise, it generates the following error:\n  Set-PrintConfiguration : Could not access configuration information for the specified printer. At C:\\Scripts\\Set_SingleSidedPrinting.ps1:7 char:5 + Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode ... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (MSFT_PrinterConfiguration:ROOT/StandardCi...erConfiguration) [Set-PrintConfiguration], CimException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x80070002,Set-PrintConfiguration \n Very frustrating. Any ideas how to resolve things? Either so that Windows Updates no longer cause the printing issue, or so that our script can reliably run, post-update?\n    submitted by    /u/ltwally  \n [link]   [comments]",

Pasting the Password without a sudo prompt or such shows the correct text, but when asked for a password by ansible or sudo, only typing does it. No idea why. It has also been laggy when connected to Servers with a less than ideal connection. Not sure why my Input depends on the connection to the customer?\n So, suffice to say, i'm not happy with windows Terminal. Alacritty does everything great, except it doesn't have tabs.\n Putty also doesn't have tabs plus it's session management is... less than ideal.\n So, what do i do? My requirements are pretty basic. All Windows stuff can be done through PS. So all i really need is something that can do SSH, Tabs, maybe split windows. Stored sessions are a nice to have, but i'm fine copy pasting IPs and using my SSH config. Right Click Paste would be nice, but Ctrl+V works too. It should use Windows' build in OpenSSH, not putty and Pageant. Other than that, it should be responsive and work as expectet 100% of the time.\n What do those of you that Use SSH for admin tasks all day, but also need to use Windows, use?\n    submitted by    /u/domsch1988  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd be up at 7:00 am, I'd be scripting, I'd be documenting, I'd be on calls helping out people, I'd be helping teammates even if they didn't ask for it, I'd volunteer for tasks, I'd be working late or on the weekends trying to get something done or working the way I wanted it.\n Now? Fuck all that.\n I did that for years, and I'd see people getting promoted and then try to figure out what I did wrong. Or at the end of the year my review comes back with all 'meets', and just get the standard raise. At my third job, it hit me like a baseball in the nuts with a simple comment from another co-worker. \n \"Why, the boss didn't tell me to do it\"\n It's that simple. All your manager is interested in is that you getting done what he or she assigned to you. Spending 12 hours making sure that documentation is just right might get you a \"good job\" comment from the manager and might get you the recognization of being a good document writer but you know what a quick bullet list you did in 20 minutes will tick that task complete and that is what your manager is interested in\n After I got that concept through my head my life in IT became a cakewalk and more important my salary has tripled over the past 10 years (and pretty much no overtime). \n That's not to say I don't do anything extra. I spend a fair amount of time studying but I take a two-pronged approach. First, learn what is needed for the current job, the processes, the tech stack, the DBs etc. That is usually a month or two then, as I like to change jobs or get promoted every 2 or max 3 years I start studying for the job I want next. \n I no longer waste my time trying to be the go-getter, the superstar, or that person everyone goes to for the answers cause at the end of the day it's just a job and I'm going to get paid the same to write an amazing doc or a bulleted list.\n Also, remember the rule of 5.

So as a solution I'm going to use one VM with the public IP, set up a firewall, and OpenVPN server. Also, I'm going to add authentication for the OpenVPN through the OpenLDAP server and redirect all routing for the VMs from the isolated network using this primary VM. So this primary VM will work as a router.\n So what kind of OS should I use for it?\n For now, I have created an ansible playbook that set up everything required using Ubuntu Server LTS. But I've read that Ubuntu is OS for the users and it's better to use BSD family OSes like OpenBSD, FreeBSD, or even OPNsense for the network devices.\n    submitted by    /u/eeexception  \n [link]   [comments]",

We average about 10-15 over the Fall/Winter season, and they often last for several hours.\n I recently identified an issue with a UPS we have (Cyberpower) where it does not take over immediately upon power loss, so the last few winters when I thought it was taking over, our Dell PowerEdge R220 server has been shutting off (not gracefully) every power outage.\n I am working on getting a good UPS in place with network SNMP traps that is more reliable -- thinking Tripp Lite as I have had good luck with them in the past. Let me know if there is anything specific I should be looking for when it comes to UPS purchases for a small server rack for a local business with a server, NAS, modem, and a couple other small devices.\n I was thinking something along the lines of https://www.cdw.ca/product/tripp-lite-1000va-ups-smart-avr-w-installed-webcardlx-1urm/3826234?pfm=srh\n For the server itself... we currently have WD GOLD 3.5\" Enterprise HDD in there. Would there be any advantage to power loss data prevention by switching to the WD GOLD SSD with the power loss prevention feature? I have been looking for an excuse to move them over to SSDs, but only if it is a good safe guard against power loss. I know standard SSDs are not good for power loss protection, but are SSDs with power loss protection any better than the WD GOLD Enterprise HDDs I mentioned?\n The server we have also has an H310 raid controller and I was wondering if switching to H710p would offer any advantages to maintaining data integrity during a power outage? I understand the performance and IOPS difference between the two but not sure if one is better than the other for handling power loss.\n There's lots more info I could provide but just doing a quick write up for now.\n    submitted by    /u/divine_tyrant  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, recently my company have mentioned they want to potentially send me to a large city that is roughly 6 hours away (flying or driving, all travel is expensed) for a week out of every month for a project that’s expected to last a year or longer. \n Travel time are hours that go on the timesheet to make up my 40 hours for the week. A hotel and car will be provided. All work related expenses can be expensed if I provide a receipt. If driving my own car, I can expense the gas at .55c/km, which adds a nice small bump to my pay cheques.\n My main concern is that a quarter of my year will be spent away from home and family. I don’t have kids, only a girlfriend who would miss me being home but can deal with it. After a while, I don’t think I will really be able to enjoy my leisure time when the day is finished if I cannot go home to relax. \n It would be a decent learning experience but it’s experience I could get locally as well. I make under $60k CAD (~45k USD) in Ontario.\n I enjoy my job but feel they are asking a bit much of me. My boss implied that travel is part of the job but I feel that there needs to be additional monetary compensation.\n Do any of you guys receive compensation for this type of extended travel for long projects?

          "description": "I've been looking into this for a while now, and still coming up short. We're a non-profit in a small country with horrible internet access. Our 4 locations are basically small, gated cities. The big center has essentially the leadership (government), a medical clinic, a store, a school, and 70 residences. Nearby is the airport and aviation team. The other 3 remote locations are each about 10 homes and an office. Each center relies on a single internet connection for everything (houses, et al) at that location.\n We have an IT team of only 6, all at the central location. Our documentation is old, disorganized, and thus hard to go through and find what you need. I think we're making progress though.\n Computers are a mixed bag of domain computers and BYOD. Letting a tool scan the network has always given unwieldy results or so many results there's not a clue where to start.\n The issue is that we have no idea WHAT we're managing, and that needs to change. We've setup a trial of iDoit and had a go. It's a nice tool, but perhaps too manual. We have PRTG that can help, but it's got so many alarms from \"false\" devices found during the auto-scan.\n The question is...what are others using for inventory and documentation? I'm looking for a tool that can tell me what devices are where with what configuration. Hopefully, something that can schedule maintenance and show a change history.\n I've been googleing on and off for months, finding a lot of sales pitches and promises. Maybe a short trial, maybe not. I'm hoping that by asking here, perhaps the options can be twiddled down to a good couple instead of what I'm (not) finding.\n    submitted by    /u/QuimaxW  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Does anyone here have any familiarity with setting this up?\n I've just started a new job in a busy hospital laboratory, and sooo much time could be saved if the normal values just auto-verified in the computer without a lab tech having to pull it up in the computer, scan it, then hit verify to send the results to the EMR. Right now, only some of their chemistry tests auto-verify, so I know it's possible. I'm gathering that the IT department there is notoriously slow (likely understaffed and not exactly giving priority to some lab passion project, understandably).\n Lab is on Cerner Millenium. I'm assuming that the set-up for this occurs in Cerner, but how? I've been taking some basic developing courses and would be happy to do this on the side as a portfolio project, but I don't even know if that's possible or where to start. Obviously I'd have to talk to IT at some point but hoping to get some input here before I even bring it up (in case it's absolutely crazy).\n As a side note, their Cepheid (COVID instrument) is not interfaced to Cerner at all, so they're manually typing in the 100s of Flu/COVID/RSVs they get in a day and then having a 2nd tech do a clerical check, which is absolutely bananas for the volume they get. If anyone knows where to start on that one as well, I'd love to attempt to tackle it if it's even remotely possible.\n TIA (and sorry if this is the wrong sub - I also posted in r/healthIT but not sure if that was right either - please redirect me)\n    submitted by    /u/wh3r3nth3w0rld  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, I'm a hardware engineer at some company. We have a device we collect data with that spits data out to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi has compiled code on it that saves the data to its local files and sends these files back to a lab PC over a closed wifi network. None of these devices are connected to the internet.\n During our testing, we're using Matlab to perform our testing procedures. Our auxiliary hardware is all reliant on proprietary Matlab drivers.\n To send commands to the RPi, we currently use Matlab to make a system call to Putty, which SSH's into the RPi and executes local code on the RPi. We need to do this hundreds of times per test, and it currently takes a couple seconds per Putty call, so the time stacks up. To push/pull files off the RPi, we have Matlab make a system call to an SFTP server.\n My question is: how would you execute the commands on the RPi faster than making system calls to Putty? My scenario to test speed is to execute a copy file command from Matlab 20 times, and time the results. Number to beat is about 40 seconds for those 20 copies. I've tried using the Paramiko library in Python, but it was slower than Putty. I've also tried using a 3rd party Matlab plugin based around the Ganymede Java library, but there's some problem with keys on our model of Rpi, even when I manually try to add keys to the RPi. My next move is a Python library called ssh2-python, but I need to get Visual on the lab PC, which will take some time given our IT situation.\n I was also toying with the idea of using TCP sockets in either Python or C++, but I'm not really familiar with TCP. I'm not a network person, so I'm kind of blindly stumbling from potential solution to potential solution. Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/jlark92  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I‘m currently playing around with TLS ans self-signed certificates for internal services. There are quite a lot of tutorials on how to generate a root ca and an intermediate CA, while there are also Howtos for generating TLS certificates.\n As far as I understood, you sign the CSR of your intermediate by your root ca and your SSL csr by your intermediate CA. You import and trust the root ca and every certificate signed by the intermediate should be trusted too.\n Well. That doesn’t work. If I, for example, check the certificate of google with MacOS Certificate Assistant, the whole chain of trust is visible. If I check my certificate, I only see the TLS cert and the assistant cries about the untrusted intermediate certificate.\n It looks like the chain between root and intermediate is broken. If read the Wikipedia article about x509 and the lead me to more questions. It looks like the certificate only contents some basic information about it’s ca (in my case the intermediate) like public key ,algorithm, etc. but no information about the root ca. How ist my browser supposed to know who signed the intermediate ?\n Or is the information on Wikipedia not complete and I have to bundle the CAs certificates with my TLS cert ?\n I have an headache now.

I try too hard to not be the big showboating guy gloating about how many goals I’m kicking and don’t want anything to think that I’m bragging about something. \n I feel like there’s a difference between being proud of a big achievement and making a huge deal out of something that was really minor.

Twice this year (so far), users have deleted massive folders/files (10-50k files) because they wanted to get rid of the sync'd folder on their pc - when they should have simply stopped the sync in the onedrive app.\n As you can imagine, doing massive restores from the recycle bin is extremely time consuming and it's tricky restoring from our cloud backup provider as it's usually not the entire site that is deleted.\n I was hoping MS had a policy we could set to stop bulk deletions (max deletions at a time = 20 or something along those lines), but from what i read and what MS support tells me, the only way to stop these deletion is to remove 'delete' permissions from all of our permissions, except for a select few staff. This also appears to disable renames as well.\n Is that truly the only way to stop this from occurring? Are there any O365 SharePoint settings to stop deletions in general? \n Thanks for your input!\n    submitted by    /u/Someone_Says_Hello  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All! \n How do you keep your AD user employee details up do date? \n All the employee metadata in the user account like Job Title, Department, Company, Manager name, phone numbers, address etc. might be superfluous in a basic org but become more useful when AD SSO is integrated with other enterprise systems such as Helpdesk that can leverage this info for approvals or hardware provisioning, etc. \n So how do you do keep track of the constant changes to job titles, employee relocations, etc. Is IT normally burdened with this? We are considering offloading this task to HR as this seems more within their realm of responsibility, but we are unsure what the best way to go about it is. Do you provide direct AD access to those non-IT users? Do you use third party software? Also, what permissions are used? \n -Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Remote_Advantage2888  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Happy Friday Sysadmins! Do you have any plans this weekend? If not, I might have something you can sink your teeth into... Number Matching in MS Authenticator. \n It's a feature which essentially rather than prompt a user for a \"yes/no\" \"approve/deny\" response on their phone, asks a user to enter a number into a prompt box. This effectively blocks an attacker from flooding their phone with MFA requests, fatiguing them into accepting, thinking it's something they've done wrong; because the user will never see the number and the attacker will instantly know that attack won't work.\n This feature went GA last week but some of you may have had it in preview for the last couple of months, it's pretty solid and I thoroughly recommend it. From a users perspective, it's no more effort than an old school SMS code, and a tiny bit more than hitting \"approve\"\n The only thing I dislike about it from a users perspective, is that I can no longer simply hit \"approve\" from my Apple watch.. so be mindful of that with your execs and managers, I guess..?\n My video talking about it, demoing it and showing you where the settings are in Azure AD can be found here:\n https://youtu.be/cjsViEclw1I\n Apologies for the croaky voice, I'm unwell but wanted to get my weekly video out there and keep up with helping the small community of followers I've been working with for the past couple of months.\n If anyone wants any help with this, hit me up!\n    submitted by    /u/mnealitpro  \n [link]   [comments]",

From my memory, I think I did the right steps but just now I tested it and it didnt work. I did the following steps:\n  \nMove Terminal Server to OU 'Servers'\n Link GPO to 'Servers' with User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar > Remove and Prevent Access to the shutdown command activated. \n Link another GPO to 'Servers' with Computer Configuration\\ Administrative Templates\\ System\\ Group Policy\\Configure user Group Policy loopback processing mode activated.\n Set security group for both only allowing the Standard-User Group to apply the policy.\n gpupdate on terminal server\n  \nWhat I expect to happen is the machine reading the loopback policy on startup, however I'm not sure if I just prevented that using a security-group. Do I need to include the machine itself inside the security group? How is it different than using \"authenticated users\". \n After reading the loopback policy, the Server tries to read the user config policy but ignores it, because it is not a user. Now when a user logs into the machine, although not being inside the OU, the user reads the user configuration from the policy because loopback is applied and applies the policy, when the user is a member of the security group. \n I'm certain I made a mistake somewhere because otherwise it would work. \n ​\n Thanks for any help\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable_Onion318  \n [link]   [comments]",

The company I work for requires us to be on an on-call rotation, 24x7 every 2 weeks (this figure depends on the number of competent techs). \n We get paid a fixed standby amount for the week on-call of $100, with automatic time and a half when responding after hours. For municipalities on maintenance agreements, our time starts from port to port (company provided car). Phone walkthroughs are not paid. For customers not on a maintenance agreement, it’s a minimum 4 hours paid, but this is rare.\n The industry I’m in is small, and there isn’t much of a baseline for typical on-call standby compensation and minimum hour paid, so I’m turning to you guys to get an idea for an average in a somewhat related field. \n Forgive me if this is not allowed, there isn’t much of a community of RF techs online.

This happened about 2 weeks ago.\n In the middle of the IT department, there is a table with our primary printer. One day, randomly, there were cupcakes and a bag with a brand name on it (the bag also contained 2 handwritten cards directed to our director and CIO). I asked around, no one knew where they came from. My coworkers started eating the cupcakes, but I didn't because I had a bad feeling about them. You need a key fob to get into our building, we had never heard of the brand before, and no one saw the person who dropped them off.\n Fast forward a couple of hours. I'm in the restroom and so is the building's receptionist. \"How did you guys like your cupcakes?\" she asked. I looked at her, confused, and asked what she knew about them.\n \"Well, a guy came in and said they were for the IT department. I couldn't get ahold of anyone, so I just sent him back.\" Awkwardly, I told her none of us saw him and none of us knew who he was, either.\n \"Oh.\"\n Getting back to my desk, I tell my coworkers what I had learned. Some random vendor we've never dealt with before personally delivered cupcakes. Whatever, vendor wants you to buy their products. What upset me more is that our receptionist just let a random person into the building for really no reason. We're not government or anything like that, but why have key fobs for the doors if our receptionist is going to let just about anyone in?\n Apparently I was the only one freaked out by that - everyone else had a cupcake.

Not to mention jumping ship from vendor to vendor can be more disruptive than just dealing with it or figuring out a manual solution for things. This job isn't fun anymore and frankly it sucks. OK, I've said what I wanted to say, thanks for listening. If you want to call out any liars in the comments feel free.\n    submitted by    /u/HolyCowEveryNameIsTa  \n [link]   [comments]",

A few of our offices use electrical rj45 but I was tasked to confirm what the remaining offices use.

I've got a vulnerability warning in the Defender portal showing that 27 of my devices have OpenSSL installed and need to be updated. The part that's confusing me here is that I can find no trace of OpenSSL installed on these systems. The only place that it shows as installed is in the Defender portal. There's no trace of it in the Windows Registry, nothing in the system path, no services running, nothing in the installed apps list, etc. But Defender is going as far as pulling in different version numbers from somewhere. \n Any ideas on what's happening here? This is only showing on about half of my devices. All have been deployed through Intune. We don't do any sort of custom certificate management and I've sure never set up OpenSSL to be deployed, so I'm not sure where it's coming from as it isn't very consistent. Some of these devices were deployed months ago, one was freshly ran through autopilot earlier this week. \n Much thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction here.\n    submitted by    /u/ChunkyMooseKnuckle  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of us - fairly senior member of the team- became concerned about this and basically said:\n \"Well the whole point of MFA is you have a known password, and then a thing, and that thing is either a hardware token, or the MFA app - However if the app now stores passwords, doesn't that defeat the purpose of MFA?\"\n From my point of view, it would be way too much of a faux pas if Microsoft just hadn't thought of this, and with our phones being in Intune, they have to have a password, they likely have biometrics etc, so i cant see it being an issue?\n Also i just tried signing in with my work account to the password keeper part, and it wouldnt accept the details, as it needs to be a Microsoft account, not a Work or school account.\n Does anyone else have any views on this that would help me articulate clearly to my colleague why this wouldnt be a security issue?

That server is hosted on Hetzner. Hetzner has been contacting me with abuse requests (AbusePhishing: SPAM/PHISH Complaint) that people have sent them and is now threatening to shut down the server. I had a look at those forwarded emails and I discovered that the Message-ID hashes cannot be found in my /var/log/mail* logs (I have enough logs to cover the timestamps that those emails have allegedly been sent from my server). The emails content contains the newsletter content from the site but also appends various Pfizer spam links and images. All other legit emails that the site has sent can very easily be found via grepping their Message-IDs in /var/log/mail*.\n Question: Is there a possibility that a malicious actor has subscribed to the site's newsletter, copy/pasted the email that was sent to them, polluted it with spam links, and reported this as an abuse to their provider, in hope that it'll reach Hetzner which will in turn threaten with shutting down the server?

They are on the clock the soon they enter the premises, and they have to be ready to start working asap. \n As a company, we have our internal courses for training purposes, and this includes almost every subject that touches the company, and some of those courses are mandatory, even for IT staff like me.\n However, having this type of messaging via wallpaper, seems overboard to me, and having to file requests to go before CAB, any GPO changes go to CAB no matter what the purpose is, for this is ludicrous.\n Time is better spent to educate the users with proper courses, not via a small text on the wallpaper, with horrible colours.\n ​\n So, my fellow professional Redditors, how would you approach this if it comes into your lap?

          "description": "Hello folks,\n I am positive I am doing something someone else has done and my google-fu is failing me. I am not a VMware guy, but our on-prem data center is 100% VMware. Today I use packer to build and distribute our new monthly windows images to our azure regions. Word made it to the powers that be that my image is better documented (infra as code essentially) and more consistent than what our on-prem server team is doing. So naturally they decided that I should just \"provide the image\" to the infra team to use on the vcenters. Problem is I am way out of my element here. I have a repeatable process to get the azure images down as an VHD to the hybrid runbook worker. The problem I haven't figured out is how to get them into a format the VMware guys can use. \n So with the long context out of the way, anyone got any good step by step guides or YouTube video they can recommend to get azure images into vSphere as a template? Or a tool that easily converts VHD files into a VMware vSphere friendly template format?\n    submitted by    /u/Taboc741  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been fiddling with a bunch of products and would love to hear any real world feedback on what folks are switching to for VPN. I have a small office network but most stuff in AWS. \n So far, I've been recommended:\n - Twingate: most often recommended in my circle and I use it for my homelab. Super easy to use and nice integrations. Curious to learn from anyone who's ran this in production at their company.\n - Cloudflare: eng team uses their CDN so easy to tack-on for their VPN product. Finding it pretty gnarly to set up and maintain and generally seems like a half-baked product. Anyone using this?\n - Zscaler: friends who work at bigcos use this, but honestly seems a little overkill. Sales process to even get a trial to POC was a pain, but seems very full featured. \n - Tailscale: lots of people use it for homelab, but haven't found anyone who uses it for their company. Generally doesn't seem serious for businesses (most of those same people pointed me to Twingate to compare). Any one using it for their company?\n Have looked at a bunch of others as well, but shortlisting the above.

Looked at Backblaze B2 but its not really built for that. Google cloud storage supports the idea of it but is expensive and still isn't really designed to be easily browsed like a filesystem. Certainly Dropbox or similar services could work well ... but we're duplicating systems and costs then which seems silly. Management suggested just start new on drive.google.com and keep running the legacy servers but that doesn't fix the issue of the old, failing equipment.\n In a perfect world there would be select folders that you would stream to Google Drive for Desktop and then others would only be available at drive.google.com but that doesn't seem possible like it once was in older versions? Thought about setting up a separate Google active-archive user that staff could login to but with 70 people and changing staff that seems cumbersome at best. \n Any suggestions?\n Thanks!\n -Adam\n    submitted by    /u/Hody-dody-tech  \n [link]   [comments]",

You need to be vigilant and always looking for improvements.\n It's a human problem if your company hires humans you have shadow IT\n Decreasing friction and improving the relationship between the service provider (You) and users is the most effective way to minimize shadow IT\n You need to understand what exists where through mechanisms that can't be bypassed. Instead of importing your excel sheet of NetBIOS names into an asset inventory tool, scan all your IP ranges. You will be shocked by how much unknown stuff sits on your network.\n Tools like WDAC and App locker are great if your just starting to tackle the problem.\n Don't villainize your self by snapping at users you catch with shadow IT. Understand why it exists and what you can do provide an appropriate alternative.\n Because your always going to have Shadow IT take a risk based approach and tackle the stuff those poses the most danger even if it's easier to remove that weird app Janet in finance uses.\n Once you have a strong understanding of what's in your consistency explore more 'heavy handed' technologies like Network access control.

          "description": "The last time I had to set up a firewall for a customer with this they went out and bought an internet plan without telling us, ended up getting sold on the 10x more expensive \"dedicated internet\" and we had so much trouble configuring the WAN as opposed to regular cable/fiber service. The provider gave two WAN schemes and were insistent upon having to use both for the service to work, referring to one group as the \"LAN\". I researched dedicated internet for some time and realized it is innately different than the usual internet service with shared pipes. \n This was months ago but am seeing more events of customers signing up for this and then passing the buck to IT and it only being a problem once the cutover happens and nothing works as expected. The last thing I remember in first example was the provider suggesting I set up my \"LAN\" with this public scheme and basically NAT traffic from one scheme to the other to show outbound coming from their \"WAN\" scheme. \n If not obvious already I feel I'm clearly missing something here: can anyone chime in on best practice to get this working as expected? Have set up countless networks and helped facilitate cutovers for businesses utilizing static WANs before, but this dedicated internet setup obviously involves more than just the WAN port config and bridge mode modem that had come to be the expectation. How do you configure this firewall side? Do you need additional physical equipment that the provider does not provide?\n    submitted by    /u/Woeful_Jesse  \n [link]   [comments]",

The usual tools and logs always point to bad password. User always claims it’s entered properly. Users are mobile, and the problems seem to occur on boot or waking up. OS is Windows 10.\n My current theory is that these lovely (/s) USB docks may be delayed in registering to Windows and identifying keyboards.

The facility is huge and has been vacant for a few years now but still maintained (to an extent).\n Thankfully some of the guys from the previous IT team were nice enough to provide any and all of their documentation. I still have a lot to go through but I was immediately impressed by not just WHAT they documented but HOW they documented it.\n This made me realize that while it is widely agreed that documentation is critical it has never been anything I've been taught or even shown how to do. Several times over the years I've felt there were better ways I could be doing my documentation but when trying to research methods or templates I would get nowhere.\n Obviously there is the catch that to show how you format and do your documentation you would have to either censor all of your actual data or take the time to input dummy data. Curious to see how you guys are able to explain or even demonstrate HOW you do your documentation.\n PS - Drink every time I said \"documentation\"\n    submitted by    /u/inshead  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use various cloud platforms to back up the important stuff, but they set this up to get every thing on the local machine “just in case” \n It is incredibly time consuming and in constant need of attention or process change due to OS updates or our MDM applying new policies, and that the software/devices perform very intermittently. \n We use Cellebrite digital collectors (MacQ) for our Mac and Windows computers. Apple is already more difficult to navigate with this, and we still cannot obtain full images from M1 macs. I run into constant issues with the software freezing/crashing and, without any issues, the image can take anywhere from 1-5 hours to complete, so coupled with these issues, I can spend days working on these and make very little progress. \n Since starting this work, I don’t believe even one file has ever been booted with an actual need to find something. \n I am having a hard time seeing exactly why we need to have these images. With all the systems in place to record an employee’s work and the machines activity, I just don’t see how booting these images up later can be too useful. When researching, it seems like I am in a pretty narrow use-case, and it seems like there would be better tools and documentation if this was a larger and needed operation.

Aside from the cost, the setup is optimal for the owner of the business as all of the employees can login at once (2 max per VM) and the work is synced through the use of SyncThing.\n ​\n Is there a recommended alternative that we can switch to? Or is this license cost going to exist everywhere? I've looked into it and saw that big names such as GCP have similar price ranges, whereas relatively unknown companies like Kamatera have cheaper prices. I'd appreciate any input.\n    submitted by    /u/Due-Fix-9809  \n [link]   [comments]",

And, like a lot of you I imagine, I’m responsible for the care and feeding of things in a lot of different domains. Some of those domains I have a lot of experience in, some not so much. \n Because I don’t have the resources or bandwidth to research and test ALL updates for example, I rely on the vendor (or trusted third party) to tell me how critical a vulnerability is to know how soon it needs to be patched. MSFT says there’s a domain controller vulnerability, deploy it to one DC today, the rest tomorrow. I generally don’t try to do an analysis to determine for each vulnerability or update how susceptible we might be. I know I can get burned this way, but I rather risk getting burned by a patch than leaving a known vulnerability in place. I do check reddit to see if a patch Tuesday is particularly rough. Standing on the shoulders of giants if you will.\n I kind of apply this same rule in other domains where I have found best practice dashboards. I know that it won’t find all the problems, but I’m hoping it will at least help us avoid the most common pitfalls.\n Here are some that I use: * AWS - Security Hub, Trusted Advisor * Azure - Advisor * Office 365 - Security checklists (forgot name?) * Microsoft Endpoint Manager - Security Score * Crowdstrike - Spotlight * Custom Dashboards - Grafana, Graylog, misc\n What tools do you use?

OIT, for some bizarre reason, does not provide project sponsors to students and you are expected to find one in a span of about two weeks. Yes you read that right - you need to find a project sponsor with a Capstone-level project lying around for you to complete on top of managing your established work schedule (we're a commuter school). This is obviously insane and thankfully they offer the option to do a research project instead and write about your findings.\n My problem is... I don't really know what to research. Specifically, our project needs to bring to light a problem in the world and how we can apply our knowledge to fixing that problem. My focus for my degree was on Network and Systems Administration. I know how networking equipment/the internet works, how AD works, some basic programming, took several business courses, and learned a bit about cybersecurity along the way.\n My original project idea was how IoT implementation can benefit businesses and the security risks with IoT devices. My advisor doesn't really like this idea and insists that it won't be a big enough topic to fill 350 hours of work for the next year. I worry she may be right, but she doesn't seem to be giving me any usable project ideas. \n Any idea what kind of research project could fit the bill?

          "description": "Ok so I’ve got Server01 which is part of a replication group. I want to upgrade it to a version of Windows Server which won’t be EoS next year, I want to have minimal downtime and I don’t want to do an in-place upgrade. Also, there’s a lot of data. \n So I’m wondering what the most efficient way of doing this is. In the past for smaller sites I’ve removed the old server from the replication group, stood up a new VM and added to the group, kicked off replication and waited. I don’t want to do that this time though due to the amount of data. \n So do I stand up a new VM side-by-side with Server01, robocopy the data, then when I’m ready rename and change the IP of Server01 and put that IP and host name on the new VM? If this is best, do I need to exclude dfsrprivate?\n I’ve also considered adding the new VM to the replication group with a name like Server02 while Server01 is still in production. Then wait for replication to finish, then (overnight) rename, remove from group and power off Server01 and then rename Server02 ‘Server01’. I feel like that’s a bad idea but I need to hear someone say it!\n Or is there a better method that I haven’t considered yet?

Option 26 to be presice.\n I added option 26 to our dhcp server, did a reboot on an end device, a forced release/renew, and the mtu ( checked with netsh interface ipv4 show subinterface showed the same default 1500\n from there I grabbed wireshark, grabbed a capture of the renewal, and the ack does show option 26 with the correct value.\n I've checked the logs within the client however there are no entries or evidence that windows knows what to do with this information.\n so, can you help me with a few questions: 1. why does windows not honour dhcp options, speicifcally option 26? and 2. how would you go about modifying the MTU for client devices?\n ty for taking the time and have a great weekend everyone :)\n    submitted by    /u/C-DomiNations  \n [link]   [comments]",

Swap file disabled.\n Also because duplicated files in linux are referenced not physically duplicated try to make unique files.\n Also always check extreme parameters like 100% read or write workload or test very small 1KB or 1GB to avoid lags when for example somebody decides to upload big file or put this file as a blob to the database. \n Analyze data in a statistical manner. When parameters are gradually increased look for linear or logarithmic spread of the results to ensure disk performance is predictable\n  \nIs there anything more to know when benchmarking disks to choose the optimal one ?\n \nI'm wondering if apps for automatic tests like webdriver io imitating concurrent users in not so random fashion should be used beside the usual fio and sysbench i use ?\n \nI know that linux filesystem is little different due to points I mentioned earlier, is there anything else worth knowing in this subject which may affect the results of benchmark disk ?\n \n    submitted by    /u/labratdream  \n [link]   [comments]",

Had him on the phone for about 10 minutes and said he didn’t need to be on the phone while I fix this so I would call him back. We hang up and I see him working on his computer (obviously I can’t work while he’s working). I message him twice - once on the app and again on Teams to say only one can work on the computer at a time - no response. An hour and a half passes before he says “sorry, let’s reschedule for tomorrow at 2”. I say fine and call him and 2PM the next day on Teams - rings once and stops. I figure he’s on a call and rejected my call or my call just didn’t go through so I message him - no answer. I was contemplating going upstairs to my main PC where my kid was (I was in the garage) but decided to stay to see if I could reach him. I call him again 10 minutes later and he says “meeting went over - 10 minutes?” This is when I hear my wife yelling my name because my baby fell from the bed about 2 and a half feet asking me if we should go to the hospital. The part that’s pissing me off is this end-user who #1 didn’t have the common sense or listen to me when I said I’m going to work on his PC and to leave his shit alone, #2 I’m trying to baby sit this end-user because he wasn’t courteous enough to give me a heads up that he was late earlier.

I'd be interested to hear how your EOP policies are configured, with regards to:\n  \nAnti-phishing\n Anti-spam\n Enhanced filtering\n Safe Links (Minecast vs EOP - We're using Mimecast, which as I understand is a retrospective check of URLs when a user clicks)\n  \nAre your users OK with having multiple places to check for quarantined/junk emails? e.g. 1st line product (Mimecast in our case), Microsoft and Junk folder in Outlook.\n Are we attacking this in the wrong way and should be focusing on tightening up Mimecast rather than looking at EOP?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/brepmassive  \n [link]   [comments]",

Examples\n  \nMoved our shop to a wireless long range AP solution to share internet with main office (building is close) to cut down on our overall internet costs. AP equipment from CISCO took literally 6 months to get. Pushed back demolition of building near the shop as our Fuel Management Pump System is there and would be cut off from internet before AP installed if we demo'd \n AC in shop storage room went out. Was asked for some reason to handle it so contacted and scheduled the recommended person boss wanted to use and it's taken them a week to finally come out but shop manager sends me repeated emails on when this is going to get done.\n Anytime I order equipment needed outside the basics it takes a week or even two to arrive. Bosses complain every time saying it should be 2 days tops like everything is Amazon.\n All Vendors I deal with lately whether its security system maintenance or door fixes/AC are behind in work and take days to show up sometimes. Again... bosses whine about it and get aggravated. \n  \nQuestion is, anyone else notice this trend getting worse?

The PIM page says the page will refresh by itself, you don't need to sign out/in. \n I've been trying this for the past couple of hours, and I kept having to sign out/in because waiting 3-5 minutes was yielding no change - the 365 admin page and the ECP page were giving a 'no access sucker' unless I signed out/in.\n Meanwhile, after assigning direct access, then unassigning direct access, then trying again using PIM, it now HAS worked without signing out and in again. Is this the usual experience others have had, or have I just been particularly unlucky with propagation delays\n ​\n 2- The Exchange recipient administrator role in particular seems bad for this - I assign it and activate it on my test account, but it doesn't seem to do bugger all. I activate it, I sign out, sign in, do a little dance, and still don't have access to the ECP. \n Meanwhile, I assign it to be permanently active, sign out, sign in, BAM it's immediately there and works flawlessly. \n ​\n I've signed out and in to these accounts so many times I'm ready to sign out of existence entirely,I just want someone to confirm whether or not this is the experience other people have had or if I'm just having a particularly bad friday night. \n ​\n I'm gonna go make a cup of tea and cry into it while I wait to see if it's just been me all along\n    submitted by    /u/8ftmetalhead  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, let's say you have 100 Windows Servers and 10 Windows 10 clients and you have been tasked with installing a brand new backup solution that backs up files and folders via backup agents. You are creating the new backup job, and you have to decide which servers/clients get agents installed, and which server/client disks/folders you want to select as part of your backup jobs. Does IT just make an educated guess at what needs to be backed up? Does the business unit provide IT with a list of data sources (structured and unstructured) and IT works off of that? \n In our shop, IT decides what should be selected for backup on a daily basis knowing where actual company data lives. If it can't be recreated elsewhere, we back it up. If there is another source of that same data (and its current, then we skip it).

This is problematic for new users because you can't change your password from RDC, at least not without making the process overly complicated by disabling NLA Server Side and a convoluted process client side with first tie logins using a secondary RDC shortcut with CredSSP disabled.\n I haven't worked in a shop that has had this problem, formally I was the IT manager for a mid size org and our TS were connected to from Windows workstations so users were already authenticated.\n The IT Manager's process has been to assign users passwords in the past and set them to not expire. Then he would communicate the password to the user or manager for login. Obviously this is 1. Not Secure, 2. Cumbersome as hell. 3. Several points of failure. \n This has been made more ridiculous by the fact that about 6 months ago they brought an MSP onboard who is now handling \"some\" of the user onboarding process including creation of AD accounts and they use a temp password as they should. But, now new users can't login. And my understanding is that new users have just been hijacking others accounts to get to sessions, creating security issues, profiles issues etc. \n My understanding is that the RDP Web Portal will resolve this issue, but I am honestly not familiar with using it and wanted to see if anyone had any input before I go suggesting this as the solution to the org. \n My understanding is that Users would connect to the RDP Web Portal via a browser where they would authenticate for the first time and be able to reset their passwords, and from there they would have access to their Terminal Services Sessions, is this accurate?\n    submitted by    /u/TheBlackAllen  \n [link]   [comments]",

How do I correctly add the Win11's C:\\Windows\\PolicyDefinitions files to our SYSVOL without breaking Win10? Or are new PolicyDefinitions backwards compatible (ie all old settings are in new templates, so will still apply)? I've updated the policy templates in the past but only within the same OS - is it just the same procedure?\n \nI think I read somewhere that Win11 is no longer supported by MDT as they're pushing for InTune. I haven't messed around with this yet, but is this true? We don't use 365 (Google Workspace unfortunately) so having to subscribe/set up InTune would be an extra cost/delay to this whole thing.\n \nIf you've upgraded your domain to Win 11, how did you do this? Did you use WSUS to deploy the upgrade or did you recall the hardware to do it in person? I know the cleanest way is formatting but let's assume that that's just not an option for us.\n \nDid your staff adjust/like the change to the center start menu/icons or do you/did you just take it back to the bottom left?\n \n    submitted by    /u/segagamer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A fellow SysAdmin was making 80K salaried, but working 60 hour weeks, easily. Typically 5-7am to 5-7pm. Not to mention after hours when on call. That is actually less per hour than average Tier 1 Help Desk technicians make here (~$22/hr), if they work 60 hour weeks with overtime past the 40 hour mark (1.5x). Not to mention, $22 is starting rate.\n 40*22*52+20*33*52 = 80,080 > 80,000\n Basically if a Help Desk worker put in 60 hour weeks, they would be above SysAdmin for annual income, even if both were doing the same (60 hours). And Help Desk would be not needing to be on call at all. The only thing stopping this, is Help Desk managers restricting total weekly hours techs can work (in theory). I know this is part of why companies have salaried workers in the first place, but it's still wild to think many SysAdmins are making such a low effective rate per hour.\n    submitted by    /u/Sadministrators  \n [link]   [comments]",

As many pointed out, this fell entirely in the realm of industrial engineering.\n A few days ago I made the company an offer. I would help restructure their processes with the help of 3rd party consultants, but I will not work IT at the same time. So they'd have to choose what full time position they want me to be in.\n After consideration they decided today that they wanted me to work full time on reimplementing their manufacturing processes and it would be very clear to the rest of the company that I am no longer IT and should not be approached regarding regarding any IT issue moving forward. This will take effect in 1-2 weeks.\n I then asked, so how will IT be handled when I'm moved off? How will we hire someone in time to learn and manage all the IT processes? They said that end-users will have to step up their game and figure out how to troubleshoot their own issues.\n I'm very excited. Not only do I get to tell end users \"not my problem anymore\" when the inevitable storm hits from IT being torn away, Im also betting they last no more than 2 weeks tops before they pull me off engineering and beg me to get back to handling IT.

After deployment, the sccm update system kicks in.\n The process of Bios firmware updates coming with Windows updates is detailed here:\n https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c07009542\n Strangely, I've never seen these bios firmware updates happen with updates pushed to clients over SCCM, even though the cumulative updates should be the same.\n Is anyone aware of a difference between cumulative updates pushed with SCCM and cumulative updates downloaded from the catalog, or of another process which might block bios firmware upgrades during the regular monthly update cycle?\n I don't necessarily dislike the update process over wsus if it takes care of bios passwords and bitlocker lockouts (which it seems to do) but I'd rather schedule it and inform the users if it would come in the regular monthly update cycle.\n The settings titled “Prompt for Admin authentication on Capsule Update” controls the password requirement for use with BIOS updates via UEFI Capsule.

          "description": "We're going to shortly refresh our fleet of remote laptops by resetting Windows, configuring them with Autopilot and enrolling them with Intune for management. We currently deploy devices with MDT and are able to specify that the drive is Bitlocker encrypted with the requirement to unlock being that the TPM is present and the user uses a PIN. It doesn't appear that this is possible with Autopilot - there's no built in mechanism during the Autopilot process to prompt a user to enter a pin that would then need to be used to unlock the drive when they power it on. Has anyone found a way to achieve this?\n This has raised the question whether the additional protection of a PIN (alongside the TPM) is necessary to secure our remote devices. If we BitLocker our drives using the TPM only as the requirement to unlock it then the data on it is protected if the drive is removed and plugged in to another machine. Additionally, if the device is lost/stolen then the user will need Windows credentials to log in to the laptop and access the data on it. If we couldn't find a way to dynamically add a pin to our remote devices, are there any things I'm missing by using this as a secure solution? \n We want our data to be secure on our remote devices and up until now BitLocker with a TPM and a Pin has been how we achieve that. I guess my question is whether our data on remote devices is still considered to be secure (in the eyes of the industry and best practice) if we encrypt our drives using TPM only as the mechanism to unlock it.\n    submitted by    /u/Donatello0592  \n [link]   [comments]",

So now I need to replace Gateway with syncing on-prem to OneDrive and then run copy flow and everything cloud only. \n What do you think? Install OneDrive on FS and manually put local folders to sync or create a VM, map the drives and run sync outside the FS? Or maybe a third solution?

I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, \"The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term.\" Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don't need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. \n  \n Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place. Just not really sure if dedicated circuit can be repurposed for shared later on with a setup like ours. \n Thank for any insight\n    submitted by    /u/Ovulating_Oyster  \n [link]   [comments]",

Before even being caught up to speed he's been constantly trying to gut all the solutions we currently have in place and replace them with solutions that he's familiar with. To an extent it's understandable but largely seems like he's trying to pass business off to friends but that's a different conversation lol. \n One of the solutions he's trying to implement is Ivanti which is understandable for MDM/UEM. Though he's trying to implement other solutions of theirs that they don't really excel at. Mainly for the reason of just having everything under one solution provider. I'm more of the mindset of choosing the best solution for that specific need (i.e. MDM, SIEM, AV, VPN). Each company and their requirements typically vary which requires a more tailored approach rather than a blanket it one. \n My question is pretty simple; What's your experience with Ivanti? \n I'm trying to understand the company/solution and it's pros/cons so that I can go into the next conversation with the ammo I need to setup the company for success. Whether that be understanding the benefits and going with Ivanti or arguing against it.\n    submitted by    /u/RickAmbramotte  \n [link]   [comments]",

To be honest I'm quite intimidated by the task, not only because the previous IT manager (who initially set everything up) did not leave any proper documentation, but also because I just graduated college last year, and I'm only in my current position because said manager left and the company has been unwilling to hire someone to replace him. In other words, I severely lack both experience and guidance. \n So far, it looks like I have two options:\n  \nConvince the company to hire the previous manager as a contractor to help with the move. The negotiation will likely be difficult, since the higher-ups still have some ill feelings towards him. But in my (unexperienced) opinion, he should know best about what's going on with our setup.\n Hire an IT service provider.

I replaced one who had basically given up at the role and let things go well beyond unmanaged. I spent the first 6 months improving every process I could, and met every project I was given. After that I thought of a few projects that I could work on that didn’t require any budget changes, since anything involving a cost I get stonewalled on. \n But now it’s a year later, and as systems admin I still don’t have access to many of our systems. I don’t have access to our email spam filter. And when I’m on group calls involving my management I’m hardly given a chance to speak, and they do my work on the call instead of letting me, making me feel like I’m in some sort of placeholder position. \n Having the title longer on my resume is nice, and work/life balance and the pay is okay. But I don’t feel like I’m respected or trusted to have the tools to do my job here. \n It’s gotten to the point where I’ve begun collecting evidence of my requests that go unanswered, so if I’m ever terminated I can prove I didn’t have what I needed to succeed. Do you think it’s better that I stick it out for another year for that job history/resume experience, or should I look to leave as I’m really no longer learning or able to work on progressing my career here?

None of the servers are accessible from the internet and it all exist on internal namespaces. All of my servers and desktops internally can get to the CRLs.\n I have had two sites using internet web server certificates getting flagged by Chrome with the error \"NET::ERR_CERT_UNABLE_TO_CHECK_REVOCATION\" while Edge is seemingly fine. Additionally, the error doesn't present itself on Chrome for all users. The same person could walk up to two machines and get the error on only one, and a profile wipe will fix the error completely for a while. \n I can load the certificate, copy the AIA and CRL locations and download them just fine. I have check pkiview.msc for any troubles and everything looks fine, I can't seem to find any issue with the PKI infrastructure. \n Chrome and Edge seem to be acting differently while unmanaged Firefox doesn't like anything signed by my internal PKI. Would there be any additional logs I can check to find out why Chrome is complaining about not being able to check the CRL and/or can someone help me understand CRLSets and if they might be the problem?\n    submitted by    /u/abetzold  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I guess this time I wasn't careful enough. \n The original mail seemed to originate from their web hosting provider stating a new invoice was ready for download and contained an HTML file as an attachment which should be the invoice itself. It was forwarded twice within their org, then to me with a request for credentials to access that site since it prompted for them. The website was an absolute perfect replica of the genuine login site and prompted for credentials. I filled it out planing to download the invoice and send it to them, since I knew the sender didn't have them. However the login didn't work. After checking the url I was on the correct site of the provider. What I didn't notice at first: I only got redirected there after entering the credentials. For some reason I got suspicious at that point and checked the HTML file which contained some encrypted java script. Of course I immediately changed the password of the account and fortunately found no suspicious activity. \n However I am still in shock how stupidly I behaved.\n Edit: just to add, that Mail did not trigger any spam filter nor did opening the HTML file trigger the antivirus or the webfilter of our firewall.\n Edit 2: just uploaded the file to Virustotal and it seems it's actually a trojan. However it's still undetected by our antivirus solution. This file was first uploaded to Virustotal a week ago.\n    submitted by    /u/Bl4ckX_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or one cannot just delete any log file and have a working database?\n It should be rather simple to make a script that:\n  \nRun esentutl /mk edb.chk\n Parse the Checkpoint line for sequence ID\n Delete all edb#####.log files with ##### smaller than value from step 2\n  \nI have been searching for a while and could not find one website about actually doing this. Surely someone must have done this before, it does not even look that complicated?! Several hits for just brutely stopping certsvc and deleting all logs which is not what I want to do if this can be done \"right\", by just deleting unnecessary log files.\n I guess I could just download the whole CertLog and play around with it, see what happens. Will take a while, it being multi-GB...\n    submitted by    /u/Environmental_Kale93  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I made contact with the vendor who told me that the network guy needs to get his hands on the problem. The logs stated that also, at least the software ones. So I conceded and went back to troubleshoot even though I was pretty certain it´s not the network, most certainly not the server and probably not the software. It runs on several devices without any issues. \n After another sleepless night it dawned to me that the only difference is, that the software is installed on a HP desk. So I grabbed just another device, slapped the software on and it runs. It just does, what it´s supposed to do, it works. So it´s the HP trash again. Why? I don´t know. I wish I could say that every single HP device is in it´s own contained part of the network, isolated from the rest of the world and hidden from any tech guy but they are everywhere and the rules applied are the same as for all the other stuff. The one and only difference is, they are HP desks. \n I honestly don´t know who made the cost-benefit analysis or if there even is one, but I´d like to see which maniac decided to buy HP products.\n    submitted by    /u/Testnewbie  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Early last week PC across our org starting having one of three types of error:\n 1 - PC would BSOD, possibly multiple times with no obvious cause and disparate error codes\n 2 - Every application would crash in turn with an error indicating issues with Trend Micro's dlls\n 3 - PC would boot to a black screen, but be online (even on wifi) and respond to remote commands (though any form of remote control would still yield a black screen)\n Eventually issues 1 and 2 would evolve into 3 in many, though not all cases. An upgrade of TM's client was complete or in progress at the time of the first presentation, which coupled with issue 2 made us conclude a botched update was the cause.\n Unfortunately repair didn't seem to work and TM's support suggested we proceed with a hard uninstall using their CUT program. The problem was this took an extremely long time (over a day in one notable case). We dug through the logs and discovered CUT was attempting dozens of tries with long timeouts for each operation, before eventually failing and moving to a more aggressive option (ie removing a service after failing to stop it).\n We discovered that an ini file was created upon launching the CUT executable and we could, if we were quick enough, replace that ini file with a modded one that reduced timeouts and # of attempts to something more manageable. This brought down removal time from hours to about 20 minutes per machine, which could be run in parallel.\n On some machines CUT would complete on first try, others would require a second application even though CUT logged its successful completion.\n After that we could reinstall the TM client with no further issue.\n TM support told us this has never happened before (when does it ever) and we're the only ones reporting it (what good luck), so I thought it'd be useful to put it here for anyone that should happen to suffer this issue or something similar.\n    submitted by    /u/senove2900  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a feeling that the previous image broke defender somehow since it included crowdstrike on the install, rather than installing after enrolling via autopilot in the new deployment.\n I’ve tried the commands I’ve found online to reset the app using AppX, re-registering it again using add-appx using the built in windows 10 manifest.xml, and resetting the app via “Windows Settings”. I’ve also tried restarting the Windows Defender service, modifying registry entries to enable “passive mode”, and simply enabling periodic scanning on the device itself. Windows defender seem to just won’t start at all. I checked group policy and Defender is not blocked.\n Any other ideas you guys may have to get defender running again?

He logs with his domain user on one PC then logs off and then logs on the other computer. When he logs off and comes back to his main pc and logs onto it, he is logged out in every app he was logged in.

          "description": "Hi Folks,\n We are designing a network for our new medical center within the region. When designing a hierarchical network, we were having brainstorming discussion with internal engineering team to take a decide on using 3-tier network for Data Center and 2-Tier for Campus (endpoints and end devices)\n The center would occupy 2000+ endpoints in the network. We propose two main core switches, setup as VSS and aggregating approx. 70 access switches installed in different floors in the building communication rooms. Single stack contains 5 or 6 access switches with 10G uplinks to upstream core switches. Access are all L2, and we route between VLANs using SVIs on the core switches and some VLANs are firewalled for Guest and IoT devices.\n Pair of high specs firewalls connected to cores for perimeter (internet, wan & dmz) and internal segmentation (servers & end devices, depending on the use case and security controls requirements.\n Eventually, with regard to servers, we are thinking about having 3-tier network: access > distribution > main campus core\n Two distribution switches with Servers SVIs on them or Firewalls. \n L2 links terminated on Cores with Point-to-Point transit VLAN. Servers connecting to TOR access switches. \n Please share your thoughts and comments for 3-tier approach and feel free to add your invaluable inputs if anything is wrong in the design.\n    submitted by    /u/techno_it  \n [link]   [comments]",

The ticket was escalated to me, and after looking into it, it just looks like someone moved the doc into another folder (probably accidentally). The user was trying to access the file from a URL link, and when it didn't work (because the file was moved), they panicked and assumed IT had done something. When I told the user that the file was most likely moved, their response is still implying that IT had something to do with it, as no one in their team (over 10 people, all with edit access to the file) would have moved the file. I reiterated that it was probably an accident by someone in the team, and a fairly common and easily addressable mistake, but the user has now involved their manager, to make sure the problem doesn't happen again. It's now become a way bigger issue than it ever needed to be, all because someone just accidentally moved an important file, and the user just can't accept that this happened and it wasn't someone IT behind it.\n This is just a recent scenario. Issues like these seem to happen all the time, where frustrated users just don't believe what you're telling them and seem to just blame anything on either IT staff or systems that they don't understand, yet speak with authority on.\n Any advice?\n    submitted by    /u/PsyduckAF  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm in my mid-30s, right here when age discrimination starts becoming a real thing, and just want a stable company for the next 15 years. \n So the good news is the company is giving us 10 months severance plus 1 week's pay for every year and 6 months of insurance after we are let go.\n The bad news. When our director called us into the conference call to give the news he was very candid and probably told us more than he should have. Basically, it boils down to money, the business leaders found they can hire in Europe/UK for 60% of US wages. They can hire Indians for 20% of US wages. Australian wages were a wash with the US. They also decided it's cheaper to move the HQ to Ireland (with much lower corporate taxes) and import to the US. \n I work with folks from Ireland and UK every day and their work is every bit as good as what we do in the states. I'm not bashing their skills but more concerned if we, Americans with insane salaries, have priced ourselves out of the global market. The state I live in has an average income of $61k. I make $153k.

I figured the easiest way to do this is to clone a \"master\" Surface Go and clone them to the other 14 machines using Clonezilla.\n I am wondering if the master Surface Go's license key will get cloned to the other machines or if their key is already burnt into bios and I don't have to worry about them. Or do I have to find the keys for each machine and \"re-key\" them after cloning? \n As of now, I don't have a budget to get VLs or Enterprise licensing but if that is the only way to do it properly I'll have to do some convincing to my bosses...\n    submitted by    /u/ZedNg  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did some PowerShell here and there and basically did this. \n 1) Who are all the retired employees?\n 2) When was the last time they have logged in to there exchange 2016 or Online. \n Nearly all have not logged in within a year or more. \n ​\n My concerns are that;\n 1) They don't have MFA enabled. \n 2) They may contain sensitive information in those emails. So if the email becomes compromised that becomes accessible information. \n 3) If the account becomes compromised, they can use that email to communicate to other employees and make it easier to social engineer them. \n 4) A wasted license. \n I am still new to my role and I may be paranoid for nothing, so from a more experienced individual what are your thoughts on this and if its best to get rid of this plan what are the reasons? \n I have some directors that agree with me, but my VP of technology doesn't (Ironic I think). \n ​\n But of course if a user isn't trying to log into there account would it really get compromised?

Myself and one other person are responsible for Mobile Technology in all forms: Vocera, Encrypted Flash drives/Ironkey, iPads/iPhones and MDM (Intune), the corporate cellular account, and BYOD support. \n We've basically been slammed since COVID happened. We work 50 hours a week, then get paged off hours because we didn't get to that one ticket that is now suddenly \"patient impacting\". Despite working without a lunch break, being in many meetings for projects (6-10hrs a week), and working my ticket queue when possible, we never catch up. For the past two years, we've never been under 100 requests, and we've been building two new sites that have many different mobile applications in which I'll somehow be supporting. As of current, my team of two support over 17k devices including 5k personal devices in BYOD. \n I know nowhere is perfect, but I feel my boss is being arrogant when I ask him about hiring more people. His response is always \"this is only a phase\" or \"we're fully staffed at what we have, we'll have to get caught up\". But other internal IT depts are hiring like crazy. The apps team hired 5 in the last two years and the epic team brought in a whole company of 20 contractors to do their breakfix while they worked on our new sites. Just as examples\n I guess what I'm asking is is this situation everywhere? Am I dreaming that IT life doesn't have to be so understaffed and overworked? I'm salary and don't break 75k, and my coworker is at 55k. We get great healthcare, which is why I stay, but just wondering if you all think I should man up and realize I work in a stressful environment and IT is that way everywhere, or is there better out there somewhere?

I hope I can explain this clearly…\n We recently upgraded PSU’s in the server from 550w to 700w. According to the Dell website, the new PSU you install will take on the firmware of the previously installed PSU. So, in this case our 700w PSU is using the firmware of the 550w PSU. Obviously we just need to install the firmware for the 700w PSU’s. Here’s the catch, Dell doesn’t have any firmware for 700w PSU’s for this server available to download. There should be firmware available for download because you can buy the r6515 server from Dell with the 700w PSU’s installed. \n When we boot up the server it enters the bios and gives a low power warning. \n IDRAC says the input wattage is 666 and output wattage - rated: 700, actual: 550. \n We have been talking back and forth with Dell tech support and their tier 1 support has no clue what’s going on. They sent technicians out this week to install a new power board but that didn’t do anything to help. The technicians got one of the Dell tier 2 support guys in the phone but he didn’t help much either. \n Anyone have any ideas or have any experience with this situation?\n    submitted by    /u/Coolio-McFoolio  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's running as a DC, a file server, and there's an Access database that clients access through some program installed on the workstations. There're two client workstations that can't have the program installed and so have to access the database directly on the server. Their previous IT set up RDS but never installed licenses; they just kept renewing the trial. We've had to fix a lot of how the previous IT did things and we are trying to get licensing for the two workstations that need to RDP into the server to access the database. I believe you can have the RDS session host and the RDS licensing manager on the same box, but correct me if I'm wrong.

          "description": "Hello fellow sysadmins,\n I'm looking for recommendations of and experiences with Linux antivirus options for on-premise company servers. We already use Symantec on our Windows servers and clients, and while it has a Linux version, it lags behind in supporting recent Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04) and it doesn't play nice with containers. We have a bunch of Ubuntu servers at various locations running QEMU/KVM virtualization, Docker (in VM), Kubernetes (nodes in VMs) und LXD containers (on bare metal) backed by local ZFS storage.\n We're looking for an option that is capable of dealing with containers, so that we'd only need to install the AV on hosts and VMs, and that offers sensible licensing/pricing, ideally per physical server instead of full price per install or at least reduced price for a VM install. Centralized management would be nice but not a requirement, log and/or mail based alerts would suffice. Needless to say we require good detection rates, timely signature updates and the capability to prevent the execution of malware. The main threat scenarios are malware getting on the servers either via compromised clients, exposed vulnerable services (hello Atlassian) or supply chain compromise (hello npm).\n The state of AV websites is a sad affair, with a general lack of clear statements about capabilities and business licensing options and costs (its all \"Contact us!\"), thus I turn to you.\n    submitted by    /u/zravo  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I made it clear that I had other interviews that week and could not formally respond until Friday. Another job offered me $28 or $56,160 a year. I called back Job A, recruiter was kind and asked me how my other interviews went. I said great and thanked him for being patient, I said another job offered $28 and wanted to see if they could match it. I stressed that I really wanted to work with them. He asked if I’d take anything lower so I said $27. This is about a $4K difference than their original offer. Normally I wouldn’t negotiate but I feel I’m the perfect person for the role-they actually sought me out from a job site-hounded me for about two weeks for an interview. They ended up offering me the role hours after my interview. My question is, did I screw up? If they reject my counteroffer, can I go back to their original offer? I didn’t make the counteroffer as a non-negotiable, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask. He said the latest I should be hearing back is early next week.

Don't ask about it.\n This week, Microsoft 365 just disabled Basic Auth from our tenant.\n So, if you are using Schemus (their sync tool) and syncing from Exchange Online (EXO), app passwords won't work anymore. \n Worked with Broadcom's support. Surprinsingly, so far so good. \n Support adviced to:\n - upgrade Schemus to latest downloadable version ( Schemus Synchronization Tool – Mandatory Upgrade (broadcom.com) ) and apply a support-supplied patch. This will enable Microsoft Graph as a source and enables usage of Exchange Online Cert-based auth.\n - Install Powershell 7.03+ plus EXO v3. If using Server 2012 R2 (like me...don't ask again) you need to create a config file so Schemus knows where to look for PoSh 7.\n - Configure an App Registration in Azure AD to allow to authenticate against EXO with a certificate (CBA, App-only authentication in Exchange Online PowerShell and Security & Compliance PowerShell | Microsoft Learn )\n - Reconfigure Schemus to use EXO CBA. \n - And that's it...supposedly.\n Why supposedly? Well, seems like Schemus still uses EXO v1 \"get-recipient\" and that causes a timeout for us for just the \"user\" sync part (which is optional, but we use it). I managed to reproduce that error and compared against \"get-EXOrecipient\", which worked fine. Already told them that, so I guess we will have to wait for another patch from Broadcom's developer, Metanate (the one who develops Schemus).\n Hopefully this will help others who are stuck with Broadcom's stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/dfctr  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're looking at Intune because zero-touch provisioning is a huge priority for us so we'd like to get our hands on Autopilot.\n The catch is, from my understanding Autopilot requires Azure Premium licenses, but we would only need that feature for the minority of users we have on Windows. There are plenty of Mac users who do want/need Office 365 licenses and we'd like to keep things all integrated, with our Okta deployment automatically provisioning/de-provisioning users in Azure.

          "description": "We are working for multiple customers. Mostly we administrate some servers or databases for those (so we run Ansible, we connect to databases, replace certificates and such tasks). Every customer is sharing us a VPN – mostly personal accounts with 2FA, not a site-to-site or a general VPN account. This means that every new colleague is getting a new VPN account. Some VPNs require additional configurations (f.ex. setting routes/DNS manually), some not. And we have plenty of technologies: OpenVPN, L2TP/IPSec, FortiClient VPN, Cisco, …\n As some are using Linux, some Windows, some macOS – there are always troubles setting the VPN's up.\n We first started using OpenConnect, which supports a lot of different VPN services. But we had the problem that some configurations did not apply correctly and that some IDS systems detected this and it was forbidden by the IT.\n So: I'm looking for a way how my co-workers easily can connect to the different VPN's. I'm currently thinking of creating an RDS Server for each customer with everything preconfigured, authenticated by a certificate – or maybe something with Amazon WorkSpaces. But I think there must be a better solution to this.\n How do you handle this? Do you have an idea how we could gain some efficiency instead of a long on-boarding process and big documentations? It can be a technical solution, as we're mostly developers, system engineers or similar.\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ubhz-ch  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was about 1.5 hours of afterhours work and then it was resolved at about 11:00 PM.\n Later throughout the night, I had two more alerts come in around 1:45 and 3:00 AM that were short term disruptions that resolved themselves. In addition, I had two clients call in at 3:00 AM and then 5:00 AM about their VPN connection not operating. I missed these two calls, and my manager is furious with me because \"that is what is expected of the on-call person.\"\n Is it reasonable to expect someone who receives alerts like this, respond to them throughout the night and be expected to start work at 8:00AM the next day and work a full 8-hour shift? Yes, we do get additional compensation for the week of being on call, but my thinking is that setting these expectations is what results in mistakes being made and on the job injuries. I'm not saying that you shouldn't work the next day but expecting someone to be up and running first thing and being sleep deprived is not a healthy thing.\n Am I wrong for thinking about it this way?

Not consistently, it can usually ping the DCs in its domain and in the forest root above it. But the lookups tend to be slow. And many other servers in the domain don't resolve.\n I've done a netsh winsock reset and a reboot, which I thought fixed it (I could resolve a hostname that wasn't previously working) but just seems to have made it a little better, not fixed it altogether. I've removed the virtual NIC and put a new one in. I've switched temporarily to DHCP. The issue persists. It's using the two domain controllers as DNS servers, the same as every other server in that domain, and they're all fine.\n \"Test-Netconnection DC1 -p 53\" connects successfully (as does DC2).\n If I do an nslookup for anything, it finds it. But if I immediately ping it, chances are, it won't resolve the name.\n Name resolution fails regardless of whether I just search for the NETBIOS name or the FQDN. I've tried putting a random dot at the end of both as per some ancient article I found on Google, but that doesn't work either.\n This server has just gone live to the whole business, so I really don't want to rebuild it if I can avoid it, but I'll try most non-destructive things out of hours.

With a good bump to my salary. As smaller MSPs are, I've got a rather broad spectrum of skills but I am no master in a lot of those. Well, that may be knocking myself a bit down, but you get the gist.\n My new employer put me into a department that will also be focused on providing managed services with some focus on cloudy stuff as well as even providing private cloud instances to customers. I am destined to be a network-guy (but it could change to something else if it fits, I am pretty open to other positions), which fits the focus of my previous position, but with a lot of focus to newer technologies like software defined networking / SD-WAN and the like which I have pretty much no clue about. (Well, I setup a vxlan peering on my proxmox-homelab-cluster and connected three VMs with it, but that's about it :-D)\n I guess I made a good impression and I was pretty honest about this lack of knowledge on my part, so there will probably be provided training at the start and I will not be expected to have this knowledge. I think I showed enough willingness to learn new stuff and general interest in IT to be a future asset to my employer.\n Be that as it may, tldr, I'd love to read up and learn about the newer network-concepts like SDN/SD-WAN and stuff in this direction but I am not sure where to start exactly. Can someone point me in the right direction? Or maybe recommend some good papers/videos about this stuff?

None of the code will be used externally - only for internal use and for whitelisting. \n We have a MS CA but we also have the ability to grab a third party cert. There are about 10 people that will need to be able to sign. We use yubikeys so we have the ability to leverage them. \n Anyone else do this in a small dev team with no code being sent externally? To be honest I've never dabbled with code signing before and most info is for Dev firms and large companies needing a lot of people to do it..\n    submitted by    /u/M0rdwyn  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is giving esoteric errors that the MSP says DATTO says are due to a corrupted disk. The whole ordeal has been dragging out over weeks and I'm basically \n \"can i replace the disk?\" no answer to that question.... \n \"can they check the disk\" \"ok we'll ask them....\". Two days later I finally get a response that the disk is fine... but something is wrong with the (out of warranty) device. They want me to sign a new 3 year agreement and they'll give me a free box (I'm on the cusp of not wanting to work with this MSP anymore so a commitment is not high on my list!). But they also increase the rate by about 30% - which seems extravagant. I hate not being backed up and I'm pretty angry at myself for not getting VEAMM community up and running as part of my 2 onsite backup system. \n I haven't had offsite replication in over two weeks. I'm unsure if my onsite/on-device backups are good or not. My SQL server backups are backing up to the attached NAS share without error, so... i guess those are ok... but they're not offsite. After weeks of no backup I'm ready to sign fucking anything, but such a strong increase sounds like a ball twist. \n Is DATTO, now owned by kaseya (mind you, DATTO saved me from ransomware that a Kaseya server distributed so... fuck Kaseya and I'm extremely sad that they purchased DATTO), jacking up prices? Or is my MSP taking me for a ride? A $2000increase on top of an already expensive service is pretty fucking harsh, in my opinion.\n    submitted by    /u/mustang__1  \n [link]   [comments]",

They're getting signed up to hundreds of different websites, lots of different languages, mostly european, some asian, lots of dutch, german and polish, and we're getting all the account creation emails. Obviously they're on a list somewhere that got sold, but wondered if there some sort of new wordpress form or other vulnerability that's being exploited. Whatever bot it is, seems to hit a website multiple times; whatever it's filling out in the forms for a name is random characters as some of those forms copy back that data to the email.\n Blocking some of it with geoip policies, some with language polices, but it's hardly making a dent. We're using barracuda. I can't find any commonality in the headers other than some have references to a php mailer in the xheaders, but that's not nearly enough to fingerprint on to block.\n Told the user that if it doesn't settle down in a couple of days, we may have to dump his current email to a group and get him a new address.\n Anyone seeing similar or know the source? Better yet, have some sort of magic regex that catches all of it?\n    submitted by    /u/sandrews1313  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey All,\n So I am trying to solve a very annoying issue that users are starting to notice and while I am aware this probably should go to the r/office365 section I am more interested to see if sysadmins have seen this and if they have, how did you solve it?\n Basically the users would be working in Outlook with calendars open capturing meetings and the like. When changing from one day to the next at one point Outlook will not draw the bottom part of the calendar and wherever you click Outlook will click that amount of cells not rendered up or down. See screenshot for the example, I clicked in the blank space but the selection was above my click. https://imgur.com/a/KxOkHv6\n Initially I thought this was an Azure Virtual Machine issue but I have since been able to recreate it on a physical machine as well. I have tried the latest Office beta but the issue persists. I have reinstalled Office, recreated the profile, used Online only mode, tried the reg key to disable hardware acceleration, tried different hardware, tried different accounts. At this point I don't know what else to try and suspect it is a flaw in Office because I have seen this with a different user who has reproduced it in Excel workbooks that have formulas that changes the display while it is running.\n I have a open ticket with MS on this but I thought I would ask here as well. Anyone else seen this before? If so how did you solve it?\n    submitted by    /u/Anakha56  \n [link]   [comments]",

I sent an email saying just that and that he would need to log a ticket to the security team to get the sorted.\n I guess he didn't do that, now everything is urgent and it's my fault. Everyone is starting to side with Bob then having a go at me. So, I pull one of my contacts from security into the meeting, asked him to whitelist the URLs used by the software, and voila! Suddenly it's working. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT BOB?\n In my livid state, I dug up that email I sent and forwarded to everyone in that meeting, then left meeting abruptly.\n jfc\n    submitted by    /u/outofofficeinoz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Everyone,\n Our main corporate location has been suffering from a rather annoying issue for almost a year now. We have a 600 user office in the midwestern United States. The trouble is, Google is classifying our public IP addresses as being in Brazil. This is rather annoying for our users, as search results return the Brazilian versions of websites as well as the search results appearing in Portuguese.\n We can easily switch the search results to English, but the Brazilian websites still appear as first results.\n Normally you can enable the browser to detect your location (probably also through public IP), however we have an Edge group policy disabling this. We are unable to enable this due to security concerns (even though every website can view our public IP anyways).\n Ultimately it looks like the issue is an incorrect location mapping in Google’s geo-cache. I have submitted multiple automated requests to get this updated (using this: https://support.google.com/websearch/workflow/9308722?hl=en). However after around 50 submissions over various months, nothing has changed.\n We are a full Microsoft shop with no Google products (so no line of sight to any direct Google support). Looking up our public IP’s using ARIN show the correct address information. Other browser and IP based location services also correctly identify our location.\n Has anyone ever ran into this issue or have any ideas on how to remediate it? I know it’s nothing on our computers because Google correctly identifies the IP location of our remote users and all of our other offices. Unfortunately it is this one office with the issue.\n    submitted by    /u/jspang16  \n [link]   [comments]",

None of our Customers have Services that are available through port forwarding nor do they use VPN connections. They have a proper professional Endpoint Security Solution (with Firewall) installed on every device.\n Now to my question: Does it make sense to deploy a \"Next-Gen Firewall\" into their network? I don't really see any benefit they would get out of an expensive Firewall compared to say a small MikroTik Router doing NAT (properly configured of course, VLANS etc.) . I heard that all those fancy things like Deep Packet inspection come with their own Downsides that i would rather not deal with. (And my Endpoint Security Solution supposedly does the same thing but right on every device with little to no configuration)\n Do you think the added Security weighs out the cost of buying, monitoring and maintaining a Firewall for such a business?\n I personally would think the money is better spent on awareness trainings for the employees than on such a device. \n What are your thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/DerSanzi  \n [link]   [comments]",

But since there are going to be a lot of people wirelessly \"hot desking\", wireless will be even more prioritised than wired. With that comes a need to make sure all the AP's prioritise traffic such as Teams (mainly) etc... over others like YouTube etc... \n If the default rules do shape traffic on the AP's into low/high priority queues behind the scenes then they will be enough for what I'm looking for here given that the default tags from Meraki seem to be correct across the board for things like VOIP and Teams etc...\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seemed to happen on the hour, and last about 5 minutes. Ping attempts during that time would timeout between offices. However, normal internet access was not affected - only the VPN tunnels. So what was the cause? After working with a couple of engineers at Meraki support, some suggested firmware upgrades and rollbacks (to no avail), we requested an escalation of the issue. After some analysis on their end, they discovered that the VPN Registry servers we were using were very busy. They changed our primary and secondary VPN registry servers. Since then, no more issues.

You can write a script that performs actions on a device or group of devices, and make intelligent decisions based on the CRUD responses. \n What about for network monitoring? API calls to devices can obtain much of the same information, if not more detailed information than SNMP MIBs can get - but how could they be worked into an operations environment? \n Most environments, mine included, have a number of monitoring tools. We use a combination of SolarWinds, DNA centre, Intermapper, and a few other methods. These systems poll devices every second (or several seconds) for new data. This is no different than the request/response format which would occur for API calls. \n  \n Are there tools built to utilize API calls to network devices? \n  Have any of you ever built a custom web application specifically to display their desired information in specific ways? I'm not an application or web developer by any means, so I can't speak to the complexity for a task like this, but I'm more looking into the need for something like this if there are existing commercial tools that do this already.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/MikeDeansMustard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good morning,\n I am having an issue with my native VLAN assignment for some reason and I am not sure why. I am very new to Aruba but worked with Cisco for a few years and most recently Alcatel-Lucent (unfortunately). The issue that I seem to be having is that at my branch location I have a newly deployed Aruba 6100 that sits in the IDF and connects via SM fiber back to the MDF. I have been using VLAN 100 for my native VLAN and my networking equipment all lives in that subnet. On the MDF side, I have my VLAN assignments set up like this\n BR-44-MDF> show vlan members port 1/1/49\n vlan type status\n 100 default forwarding\n 112 qtagged forwarding\n 164 qtagged forwarding\n 184 qtagged forwarding\n 188 qtagged forwarding\n 601 qtagged forwarding\n When I set my native VLAN on the Aruba switch trunk to match the MDF I lose connection to the switch and have to wait for the checkpoint to revert my changes back to the native VLAN being 1 before I can access the switch again. My trunk interface on the Aruba side is set up with \n Native VLAN: 1\n Allowed VLAN List: 1,100,112,164,188\n I also noticed that the Aruba switch VLAN 1 is pulling a DHCP address in the same subnet as my VLAN 100 address which surprised me that it didn't throw an error for overlapping subnets. \n BR-44-IDF# show ip interface brief\n Interface IP Address Interface Status\n vlan1 10.1.94.21/25up/up\n vlan100 10.1.94.125/25up/up\n I am not sure if I am missing something silly that I need to do in order to stop this behavior and have the VLAN 100 act as the native VLAN with a static IP instead of VLAN 1 with its DHCP-assigned IP. Any help in finding the piece I am missing would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/N3TW0RKJ3Di  \n [link]   [comments]",

I work for an MSSP and we have a customer sending Meraki logs to our SIEM - they have enabled FLOWS, which results in a \"flow\" type as well as a \"ip_flow_start\" and \"ip_flow_end\". The flow log contains more data than the start and end logs - it has the mac of the source, the outcome (allow or block)\n As far as I can tell, the only value of the start and end logs are calculating the elapsed time of a flow. However, there is no unique field that ties the two together, only the source and destination IP and port. \n I don't think the SIEM has any rules that rely on the calculation of flow length - so I figured I should just turn these off to save the customer some $ on data ingestion costs.\n Has anyone ever disabled just the flow start/end logs? In the interface there is only the Flows role. Googling this tells me the customer may need to engage Cisco support in order to do this?\n    submitted by    /u/Unreasonable_Yam  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ideally, we would get a second drop from the carrier to have an uplink in nexus2, and they could also establish it as a bgp peer.\n Otherwise, what are my options?\n I could add static routes for each remote subnet on nexus2, but that doesn't seem ideal, either.\n Right now, the bgp config on nexus1 is as follows:\n router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/24 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 address-family ipv4 unicast soft-reconfiguration inbound always \n And Nexus2, I configured bgp in case I ever needed to physically move the MPLS cable over.\n router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/16 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 update-source Vlan999 address-family ipv4 unicast prefix-list no-default-route in router ospf 1 redistribute bgp 999 route-map MPLS passive-interface default redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS route-map MPLS permit 10 match route-type external internal \n    submitted by    /u/FitButFluffy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The two are exchanging their communication via TCP. \n I also did a vulnerability scan using GVM/OpenVAS and found out that the infusion pump is using an old/deprecated version of TLS (version 1.0).\n Now the data that is being exchanged is send in plain text (also a lot of sensitive data) despite TLS.\n I'm kinda new to networking and the whole security aspect that does with it so excuse my ignorance. However, shouldn't the data be encrypted in some sort because of the TLS that is implemented?

Any input at all would be greatly appreciated.\n I am looking for a way to streamline some aspects of my job by doing some remote commissioning of PLCs, BACnet gateways, Modbus devices etc.\n While I am completing these works at the moment, the site is typically under construction, so there is no internet access or core switch operational. I have to manually plug into network switches around the the site and configure devices that way.\n I have got my hands on a cellular 3G router and have got it configured so I can use it to remotely connect to a site PC via RDP and use that for remote commissioning.\n What I would like to achieve is being able to plug this 3G router in to any isolated network switch on site and be able to connect to and pull data from devices such as the PLCs and gateways dynamically and communicate with a remote PC rather than a local RDP.\n Ideal setup would be:\n  \nRemote PC at home (192.168.xxx.xxx)\n 3G router plugged into switch on site (10.10.xxx.xxx)\n Applications on Remote PC at home able to communicate with IP devices plugged in to network switch on site (For example opening my PLC configuration program and plugging in the 10.10.xxx.xxx IP Address to be able to configure it remotely.\n  \nI have got the dynamic DNS side of things working and am aware I can set up specific connections via port forwarding, but I am looking for a more dynamic solution where someone on site can plug this router into any switch on site and I will be able to talk to any of the 10.10.xxx.xxx devices dynamically without having to set up dedicated port forwarding for each unique IP address.\n Is a solution like this feasible, or should I continue with the site laptop/3G router combo I am currently using for remote access via RDP?\n Appreciate your time and input.\n    submitted by    /u/Toasteroven47  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hoping to avoid a micro PC with two network ports: our setup is portable, people tend to yank power before worrying about shutdown sequences.\n Details:\n Broadcast is used for detection then multicast for actual communication, so both machines need to be on the same LAN to play nicely.\n They also use two realtime communication protocols at the same time, one protocol is nice and efficient, and the other one tries to hog the entire link to itself. The nice protocol uses IGMPv2 and the 236.0.0.0 range, the other protocol is a blackbox but uses 239.0.0.0 and opens ports 30000 thru 30007. I think if I could drop 239.0.0.0 and the associated ports I could solve my issues.\n I'm trying to add Point 2 Point wireless for long range comms using the lightweight protocol, but the heavyweight protocol seems to saturate the wireless bridge and the lightweight protocol can't connect. Everything works OK enough with Wifi 6 links, but I'm trying for hundreds of feet in a noisy environment, with TP Link P2P or Ubiquiti P2P limited to their 100Mbps ports.

I've been trying to make a playbook with the following workflow: \n An interface in NetBox (our DCIM) is updated > A webhook is sent to a server > A script is executed with a number of details about the interface (access/voice/trunked, etc) which launches an Ansible playbook enacting the changes made in NetBox.\n It's working decently, but I've ran into an issue. One of the plays is meant to configure an access and voice VLAN on an interface, but it appears to be executing the commands out of order. Specifically, I think it is trying to disable trunk encapsulation before setting the interface's mode to access (this particular interface was set to trunk prior to trying to run this test). I'm…",

          "description": "I almost posted this in r/homenetworking because the needs are so basic. \n My friend has asked me to recommend a router for his small business office. They only need it for delivering internet to their staff laptops. They don't have an internal network/domain or anything. All of their HR and Scheduling they just use websites for and all storage is google cloud storage. \n They have equipment from Cox but the router constantly drops connections and has a weak signal at the far end the building. And it seems to be limited to 10 connections simultaneously when there are generally about 15 to 18 people in the office at peak. \n They're just looking for something that's fairly simple to setup/manage, can deliver solid speeds, and allow upwards of 20+ users simultaneously. \n It almost seems like any basic router will do the job, but I think signal strength was my concern as the office isn't HUGE, but their internet comes in in one corner of the building so the router will go there, and have to pass through many many walls to reach the offices at the opposite end. \n Thanks for any recommendations\n    submitted by    /u/Mattock79  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, it seems like Cisco has amended the EoL announcements for the following products:\n  \nCatalyst 3650: \n Original End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2024\n New End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2026\n \n Catalyst 3850: \n Original End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2023\n New End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 10/2025\n \n Catalyst 3850 fiber SKU's: \n Original End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 4/2025\n New End of Vulnerability/Security Support HW: 4/2027\n \n  \nThey basically seem to extend the vulnerability and security support by 2 years. As the Catalyst 3650 & 3850's will never get IOS XE v17.x support, IOS XE v16.12.x will be the last version to run on these. The EoL announcement for IOS XE v16.12.x also states:\n  \nPlease Note: Catalyst 3650 and Catalyst 3850 platforms are not part of this EOL announcement. Refer to 3650/3850 Hardware EOL announcement for software support timelines.\n  \nAre we correct to state that with this Cisco is committing themselves to keep IOS XE v16.12.x alive for these platforms and fix future security issues might they be discovered? Because it seems like a lot of overhead to keep supporting such an old codebase. However these dates are important for us during budget meetings to help decide which devices to replace so we'd like to be correct in the interpretation.\n    submitted by    /u/bylienator  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! \n I currently have an application web server in my DMZ. The server has every port on and is closed off from the internet, but it still can't access files on the application server it's based off of. The DNS requests it is sending are timing out. DNS and firewalls are not my speciality, I'm a hardware guy that got pushed into a sole admin job. So I do not know the most secure way to give a DMZ server access to DNS requests and SMB requests so that it can access the files that it needs to. This is the only server inside the DMZ other than the firewall interface itself. It's a Palo alto firewall as well. \n Once the DNS requests can finish out I can packet sniff to find the exact ports I need to be able to run it, but I can't do that with out that DNS requests finishing out. \n ALSO: important! *** If anyone works in dental laboratory technology they would know exactly what application web server I'm trying to setup as it is a standard in the industry and could probably help way better based off of the way they set up theirs.

I was hired on by Dell before I finished my courses and decided to dedicate myself to their company. The job became fully remote and I started going nuts around 6 years. It was fun at first but man, I just need people around me. \n I had experience with network engineering from reading the bulky books but hardly anything was applied experience because I was hired on with Dell. I tried to segue into enterprise but even after years it was difficult to get in. I learn best by doing things, reading just doesn’t stick. I was outperformed by many who were smart as a whip. \n I’ve left Dell and landed a job at Charter/Spectrum - this is my first week. I feel totally lost as I’ve forgotten many things. I’ve been working on client computers for so long that it’s all I know. I plan to utilize the offers for CCNA and JDCNA to get back on my path but for now I’m focused on just kicking ass through my training. \n My main question is which areas to focus on in an enterprise tech support role here (I’m being trained on many things I don’t have experience with). The CLI for now is superputty and I’m trying to use my CMD and PS experience as much as possible. To be honest though I’m just a little intimidated. \n TLDR; Hired into enterprise customer support. Hoping for suggestions on what to learn after I clock out daily. I’m looking for network engineering or cloud admin areas. My new company doesn’t have 1x1 type meetings to assess career paths.

Most providers are resellers and there are only a handful of providers who actually own the infra and source and host the proxies themselves.\n From my research these ISP proxy providers get IPs from ISPs and then host the proxies themselves for which they need both hardware and software. the IPs are already announced on the ASN of the ISP which gives them the ISP type IP.\n Now, I have some questions about these handful of providers.\n ​\n  \nWhat kind of hardware do they own? How is the hardware mapped and how does it work together?\n Does the ISP give them access to a server that the ISP owns with the bought IPs connected?(some B2B providers sell like this)\n Or, do they need to have their own servers and they lay the cables from the ISP datacenter to their servers and host the proxies there?\n What software do they use to host? Is it the normal squid for http/https and dante for SOCKS? I'd assume they write their own software. So,\n What is the prerequisite knowledge to write that software? I suppose its socket programming(correct me if I am wrong).\n Lastly, What is the cost of the hardware for hosting lets say a /20?

          "description": "Hi. \n I have pretty much no knowledge about networking but trying to fix a problem in work. We have a control unit on our furnaces which was connected to a laptop via Ethernet that displays all data and history on the program we use. The laptops battery has bulged massively so I’ve decided to rearrange the previous workers setup and I installed an ssd in the pc I use in here as well, hoping to run the program and work network all from the same pc. I bought a switch which both the network and furnace control unit are connected to. I’ve successfully managed to connect to the network but i cannot ping the control Unit. After reading a bit about switches I can understand the problem but no idea how to fix it. The unit has its completely separate ip address. I’m assuming when pinging, it’s trying to find the ip on the network. Is there anyway I can fix this and connect to the control unit ? \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Chriso132  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our Sophos SG is our internal gateway to all of our vlans so the Sophos XG will be the same. We would like to put the two in parallel so that we can slowly migrate a few vlans over at a time, but are struggling with the gateway/routes part.\n Without changing all our IP's and to keep gateways the same - are we best to create a new vlan exclusive for routing all traffic from the XG to the SG?\n For example we disable vlan 2 on SG 192.168.2.1, we then enable vlan 2 on the XG 192.168.2.1But our domain controllers and remainder of our environment is on the SG. So do we static route interface vlan 2 to the IP of the SG? How will it know how to process vlan 2 traffic if the vlan is turned off?\n Our aim is to pick one on prem application at a time and essentially test it before going live. And with everything live and in parallel we can log into the SG and Cisco ASA to compare rules and figure out where the config is incorrect on the Sophos XG.\n Any help or guidance would be appreciated.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/TrashAmbitious9083  \n [link]   [comments]",

(It wasn’t ☹️ ) I noticed that the route map denied 2,753,559 prefixes which seemed to be an excessive amount. I’m guess this excessive amount of routes is due to their blended circuits with full bgp routes so I’m probably receiving all the prefixes with multiple paths and that’s the reason the prefixes are 2.7M ?\n Also in terms of memory will the ASR1001 non X edition support 16GB of ram (2x8 GB) or is it only 4GB sticks with a maximum of 8GB?

          "description": "I'm trying to wrap my head around this:\n We have a Cisco ASA 5515-X. And we use a static NAT rule with automatic address translation rules to direct HTTPS traffic to a specific web server on one of our LANs. This works fine from the Internet and LANs behind the ASA but does not work from our other /29 static WAN IPs from separate routers.\n From our ISP handoff we connect all of our routers outside interfaces to an 8-port unmanaged switch. We do have an ACL in the ASA to allow HTTPS to this server as it works from the Internet without issue. The issue is any traffic from our other 3 routers/networks using this /29 WAN IP range can't access HTTPS on this server. These /29 WAN IPs rightfully do NOT go out to the Internet and know their next hop is another router on this unmanaged switch.\n It looks like traffic is being blocked by a 'rpf-check' subtype on the HTTPS static NAT rule.\n nat (inside,outside) static interface service tcp https https\n So maybe I'm using the wrong NAT setup, or some traffic isn't being matched so it's being blocked by an implicit rule?\n What we are trying to do is to allow users of these other networks to access our websites on this web server. This used to work when we had a different ISP, but they were very different static WAN IPs with the old ISP and not from the same /29 range.\n P.S. I know the ASA 5515-X is end of life and we are working on replacing it.\n    submitted by    /u/CynicalWaffle  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m an IT engineer, I like to think I’m not a complete n00b, I’ve successfully been in this field for 10 years I just neglected to learn some of the basics but do well at learning on the go. \n This site has 1GB single mode dedicated fiber coming in to the MPOE. We are currently, and temporarily, using an office space with existing infrastructure. They got CAT5E running to this MDF, into my Meraki MX100, and then back out over CAT5E into a Meraki 24PoE switch (can’t recall which model at the moment but can confirm ports are 1Gb compatible) and then to 4 Meraki MR42s. We are a commercial construction company, this site hosts our team as well as our subcontractors which are mainly an architectural firm and a mechanical/electrical/plumbing — aka high usage on full days (250gb up and down). The device connections are spread evenly across the WAPs. Channel utilization is also spread well. Users connected to the WAPs max on speed tests at 72mb. On these busy days there could be 30-50 users. I’m trying to understand how there’s so much loss to the user. I haven’t been able to test directly myself, but the ISP Claims their circuit test results at full speeds. Tests from my router max at 750mb. Tests from the switch max close to that. Tests from the WAPs max at 200mb. Again the user even on a light user day gets 72 — but on busy days they experience soooo much latency and I’m just… lost. I cant see where or why. \n Application usage in the dashboard shows normal activity, UDP or secure web, MS apps, AWS etc (lot of cloud storage, pretty much everything is SaaS). \n But I do wonder if the CAT5E is an issue. \n Can anyone provide some guidance on testing further or troubleshooting? Or validate my one and only theory? Thanks in advance and sorry for sounding like a network n00b. I promise I’m not a total beginner.\n    submitted by    /u/ThatOneTDGuy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently I'm trying to see if it's possible to route 100% of our traffic through our cloud based WAF before it reaches our firewall. \n At one point I tried doing a permanent 301 forwarding of the root domain company.com to www.company.com, and then C-naming www.company.com to the edgekey which points to the site. This worked for HTTPS, but broke HTTP redirection causing the site to fail if you didn't specify HTTPS. \n Next, I thought AWS might work if we moved our domains there because they allow ALIAS records for root/apex domains, but after closer inspection it seems limited to only pointing to something else hosted at AWS. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html\n After a bit of a learning process, it's looking like the only real option to route ALL traffic through our WAF is to pay them to host our subdomains/root domains for us. This isn't cheap.

I can even connect the MFP to a mobile network and send emails with any of those SMTP settings with no problem. Just not through their network except for that one email service provider. \n Everything that makes sending emails through an MFP work should work, but doesn’t and it’s only happened with these two customers with their bonded network connections. What I think is happening is that the 250 OK isn’t coming back, so the MFP just gives up. \n What can I ask them to look for when I visit them again? Should I ask to plug in and tracert, telnet, etc. from within? I get scared plugging into another’s network.\n I can’t ask if the prefix or suffix is being blocked, nor can I ask if the port is being blocked because that one email service provider works. It’s just all other ones don’t. ¯_(ツ)_/¯\n Sorry for the inconvenience.\n    submitted by    /u/why_did_that_happen  \n [link]   [comments]",

The connectivity appears stable and i dont see packet loss across the link and there is about 70ms between the two. I've performed packet captures from the BO Side and the HO Side. I was hoping to get some indication of where and if the fault is with the link. Also note, we have 3 other BO's connected to the HO with the exact same setup and no performance issues.\n After the initial handshake i see a large number of retransmissions from the HO Side with ACKs from the printer in the BO. This continues for about 15 seconds before a number of back and forwards of packets . After this, 10 seconds of what appears to be healthy communication occurs. I get a TCP Window full from the HO server to the BO Printer. The as well the ad the retransmissions and dup ACK returning.

For the last two years our data closet has sat gathering dust, and I got fed up with a perfectly good 80TB of shared storage sitting unused. So I took a photo of all the various serial numbers, brute-forced the passwords (they were all the defaults - go figure), and bought the company’s first PC to see what I could do.\n Here’s a list of the equipment on our rack from top to bottom: - D-Link DGS-1210-16 (not connected to anything) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “LAN”) with cat6 cables running to stations - HP1920-48G network switch (labeled “LAN S”) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “PHONE”, the phones and their breadboard-looking-box have been removed) - CISCO Catalyst switch (Labeled “PHONE S”) - NETGEAR ProSafe XS712T switch (with one fiber expansion port, connected via fiber to NAS, and Ethernet to LAN, second NAS) - 24-port RJ45 patch box with mix of Cat 5e, 6, and 6e ports that run to CAT7 cables to edit stations - Synology DS1618+ - Synology DS3617xs\n My goal is to get an office network up and running with the CAT7 lines running 10Gb to edit stations and Cat6 lines running 1Gb to producers stations. From there, I want to host a server for Signiant Media Shuttle that will allow my NAS both through my router’s firewall and to the office network. I presume this means it all has to go through either the 10Gb or 1Gb switch (or both?). My office has 1Gb fiber through Verizon, and we have their router.\n If anyone out there has any advice for me, or can point me to good resources, I would greatly appreciate it.\n https://imgur.com/a/EaComxr\n    submitted by    /u/ReelBack96  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I started a new job and in a process of modernizing my network. The current network is a huge layer2 domain. The customers are in R&D and use a lot of multicast and broadcast. I am planning to turn this network into layer3 since 90% of our traffic is east-west. I am thinking to implement the spine-leaf topology. And utilize vrf-lite for each customer. My network is spread between five different buildings. The farthest building is probably 3000ft away from the main one. Also, the fiber between buildings is either OM1 except for the farthest one.\n It seems like I am going to be using Cisco C9300 and C9500 (or maybe 1u Nexus switch)\n  \nCan I use C9300 as leaf switches?\n Can I use C9500 for my spines?\n  \nI am thinking to deploy a couple of leaf switches to each build. I am not sure if this is a good idea or not. My understanding of the spine-leaf network, the vrf-lite exists only at the leaf level. If I have a tenant that happened to be located at two different buildings, the tenant's VLANs will be extended via vxlan / l2vpn. Am I right about this? Does the VLAN in bldg A need to match the VLAN ID in bldg B for the same tenant?\n Also, I am still wrapping my head how the routing between tenants. Since each tenant will be placed in a vrf-lite, then I would have to use route-leaking. Do I need to create an ACL on the leaf switches if the traffic between tenants must be restricted based on their applications (e.g. ssh, ftp, etc.) only?\n For my infrastructure, servers (AD, NTP, DNS, DHCP, ISE etc), Docker containers, end-users, and oob (ipmi and network management), should I put these on their own vrf-lite or should I put them on the master/default table? What is the best practice for infrastructure?\n ​\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/forwardslashroot  \n [link]   [comments]",

My opinion is its probably best to plug the VOIP provider's device needing a public IP directly into one of the other ISP router's switch port.

We've kept default settings mostly, no firewall but no ports being forwarded, except 22 for ssh which goes to a DMZ and then to the pi. 443 and 80 take you to the gateway login screen.\n First question: Does having no firewall matter if we're not forwarding any ports? Surely traffic just dies in a slightly different way?\n And much more importantly:\n Am I going to get DDoS'ed on port 22 any day now? /var/log/auth.log shows failed connection attempts every few minutes. The root account has a complex password with timeouts per attempt, so I'm not worried about access, but is it only a matter of time before some more ambitious bot discovers an open ssh port serving password attempts and has a thousand computers a common password dictionary on me? Or some Russian hackers take me down just so they can pretend I'm a drone bill the KGB?\n If yes, is the way to be safe to close down all ports and use openvpn to gain access? (This sucks because we'd like to access our gateway if the pi goes down). Or could I geo-lock access and save myself? \n But at the end of the day, even if the gateway is set to deny all requests except ones from my own ip address, couldn't someone DDoS the firewall?

Bare with me, as this is the first time I have ever worked with Cisco Devices, so my knowledge of them is fairly slim.\n Here is the situation broken down very simply:\n - We have 2 ISP Connections (Primary and Backup)\n - We have 1 CORE Cisco Switch (Cisco 6807XL)\n - We have 2 CheckPoint Firewalls setup in \"High Availability Mode\"\n Now here is where I THINK I understand the setup, but in reality I need clarification or for someone to tell me that I have it worked out in my head correctly lol.\n I have roughed up a very rudimentary drawing of how it is setup -- Here is the link: https://ibb.co/zhBwnK1\n All I am curious about is:\n 1.) For the ISP Connections... They are going into Ports that are tagged as VLAN 17 & 18 .... And the Firewalls are connected to more ports that are also tagged as VLAN 17 & 18 ----- Does this mean that the Internet is \"piping into that first port\" and then any other ports that are tagged as 17 / 18 ... are automatically getting blanketed with that ISP connection (Just like how an unmanaged switch works)? And Thus.... in the Eyes of the Firewalls, the Firewall's WAN Port just thinks that you took the Ethernet cable from the back of each Modem... and plugged it straight into the Firewall?\n In all my years of experience with networking, I have only ever seen the chain look like this:\n ISP Modem >>> Firewall >>> Core Switch >>> Smaller Switches >>> PC's / Printers / AP's / Etc\n So the fact that this job is setup backwards (in my eyes) as:\n ISP Modem(s) >>> Core Switch >>> Firewall >>> Smaller switches >>> PC's / Printers / AP's / Etc ---- And the fact that I am a Cisco novice lol...

I stayed there for about 10 months and then I got a call for my current job and I’ve been here for nearly 3 years. \n Now.. my current workplace are getting rid of all Cisco telephony and moving onto MS teams, no issue there but I’m not feeling any personal development for myself and I’m not sure if I should get my CCNA and go back into networking (also worried about a salary cut as i’m now a mum and I also support my mum financially as my dad left when I was very young) or do I delve into the cyber space as I always had an interest for it.\n My husband is suggesting I try programming as he’s in the field and he thinks, with my background I won’t have a problem landing a job if I can learn and understand it.\n    submitted by    /u/MeeMee_x  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am extremely novice to the Python world but was recently assigned a task of doing data collection on around 100 IOS switches so it’s not very feasible to manually SSH to all of them and run show commands, nor should it be. I need this done by the end of the week which is why I am trying to use this script that’s already published as I know I won’t have time to learn from the ground up by then.\n Anyways, I am not having issues running the script, I am able to run it fine and it “works,” but the account I have for access needs to pass the enable password which this script doesn’t account for, so whenever it tries to create a new file using the host name via ‘show running-configuration | i host name’ it just ends up not naming the files with a host name like it’s supposed to, and overwriting them because I can’t view the running config with my account. I have been trying for a couple of hours to modify the code to allow the enable password, but I just can’t seem to figure it out. I was able to create a very basic script and use net_connect.enable() which worked for passing the enable password, but was only ran on one device and didn’t export the output to a file which is needed. After I was able to get that working, I tried adding that bit and the enable password into the ShowCollector code in multiple different areas, but ultimately couldn’t get it to work, and now I am stuck on where to add the parameters which is why I am here lookin to get some pointers/ideas on where to look! \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Littleboof18  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello fellow network nerds! :-) For many years I have been helping to send out RIPE Atlas measurement probes (world's largest open Internet measurement platform) in the US - initially a few hundred as IPv6 deployments happened. There are currently ~1,400 active probes in the US. But with some newer ISPs there are gaps that would be cool to fill - initially newer ISP connections like Starlink and 5G fixed wireless (TMo & Vz). (Next year maybe some rural FTTH ISPs.)\n In my day job[1], I just renewed our RIPE Atlas sponsorship which gives me another block of probes to deploy. If you might be interested in hosting a probe on your connection, I am guessing I will have probes be able to ship them in about a month (given the upcoming IETF meeting starting this weekend). Once you receive a probe, it connects to your network via Ethernet and you will need to use the RIPE Atlas site to activate the probe – which is about 5 mins work.\n If you might be interested, please PM with the following info: Your first & last name, your shipping address, and your email address for probe activation process.\n Don’t know what RIPE Atlas is? See https://atlas.ripe.net/ \n Thanks! Jason\n [1] Day job is at Comcast where I work on Internet measurement and new standards and lots of other good-of-the-Internet sorts of stuff. This RIPE Atlas system is run by RIPE NCC - all I am doing is facilitating distribution of probes in the U.S. Here's a somewhat recent paper I co-wrote about Internet measurement: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372135.

I'm primarlily an Aruba engineer, and not too familiar with the IOS XE series from Cisco, although I have some battle scars from the 2500-series.\n I've read the documentation, and while it's very informative, I struggle to find answers for some of the basic principles. \n My main question is wheter the AP's require dedicated software images loaded, or if they will pull their software from the controller image named C9800-L-universalk9_wlc.17.06.04.SPA.bin. My understanding so far is that during an upgrade to new major release, AP images are included in the controller software.\n The other thing I'm questioning is which upgrade procedure is the most safe and efficient. I'm reading about SMU, hitless upgrade, ISSU etc. The customer does not have N+1, just a single controller. We have planned maintenance, so I'm not bothered with hitless upgrade etc. Should I just upload the .bin-file, select \"INSTALL\" mode and run the upgrade - that's it?\n ​\n Appreciate any helpful advice!\n    submitted by    /u/LeakyRoutes  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've noticed lately users keep letting me know their internet is dead, which is odd. Every single time this has happened so far (3 times) the vlan in my switch is showing a vlan that hasn't been in use by this location for a long time. Is there any reason a switch would \"default\" or change the vlan on the running configuration without a user's input?

Why does a connection get a fraction of the transmission capacity? This makes no sense to me.\n In the TDM, you're switching between circuits, but the speed of the link doesn't go down based on the number of active circuits. But I guess you could argue that the transmission rate is reduced since you're not sending data when the circuit switched from you to others, so it's a if the network is slower, but when you're sending data, you're sending it at full speed possible by the link. But I don't understand why a 1Mbps link is quartered to 250kbps if there are 4 circuits? Or is this saying the same thing I said, it's a if the link speed is reduced?\n In the FDM, this makes completely no sense to me. You're dividing the spectrum, but you're sending stuff in parallel and at full speed just with its own bandwidth. No?\n    submitted by    /u/Jastibute  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello gents,\n you may find this a funny story, but I started recently to work for a data center provider in Europe. Initially, we were not carrier neutral so we had been trying to resell the internet traffic we purchased from tier 1-2 carriers to our clients as our own service. I mean it works well, as long as the customers aren't the smartest ones and are ready to pay for it. \n As I am one of the most experienced guys when it comes to carrier network (even thought I am in telco and carrier sales for more than 15 years) they now asking me to develop and establish 2 new products.\n  \nBecome a carrier neutral DC\n Develope a Business Plan for a IP transit product\n  \nRegarding the first task.\n I am fine with it, as this had been my key business my entire career. The challenge is: They want me to offer these services (carrier neutral) only to the new clients, but not to the existing ones. So they want carriers to join, but will not allow them to approach existing customers, which is nonsense. IMHO. Why should carriers join us if they are not able to do their business and with whom? I need to write a business plan for that and maybe anybody has any kind of templates or something I can use, I would really appreciate it. \n Regarding the IP Transit Product.\n I need to write a business plan and present it - even though, again, I am not a product designer nor manager, I used to be sales all my 15 years in DC Business. But that's ok, I don't have any choice. So any plans how I can start? \n Thanks in advance...\n PS: Sorry English is my 3rd language\n    submitted by    /u/deveto80  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently in the last chapter on Network Troubleshooting, on the section ipconfig/ifconfig/ip. He shows an example of the macOS/UNIX ifconfig output, and on the inet line it says:\n  \ninet 192.168.4.78 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.4.255 \n  \nI'm just wondering why does the netmask show in hex and not dotted decimal or CIDR notation? Wouldn't it normally be written as 255.255.255.0 or /24? \n This seems to be specific to the ifconfig output, as ipconfig shows the subnet mask with dotted decimal notation, and ip shows CIDR notation. This is the first time I've even seen a hex netmask, as literally the rest of the book has used dotted decimal or CIDR notation. Even in my limited real world experience troubleshooting computers and networks, I've never seen a hex netmask.\n I've tried Googling the answer, but most of what I found was just decimal to hexadecimal conversion charts, or talking about hexadecimal in a general sense not really networking focused. From what I read I think it might just be a remnant of the early mainframes and UNIX systems, and the language they ran on. But I can't find anything definitive about it. \n I don't think it ultimately matters what notation the subnet/netmask are written in, but I am I wrong is there some system out there where I'll need to know how to convert binary to hex for subnetting?\n    submitted by    /u/StJerneJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

Clients get a static IP address and our routers/firewalls etc are configured to (dis)allow those clients to the backends. So basically, every client can get an ACL list attached to it. \n But now we are going full into Azure. Since the Azure VPN gateways only give out dynamic IP addresses our current setup can't be transferred to native Azure VPN's. \n I've seen that Cisco has the CSR 1000V in Azure, but I can't find anything regarding static IP addresses (or pools) in the documentation. So, I'm not sure if this would fix our \"issue\".\n Does anyone have an idea on this issue? I'd rather not deploy a VPN gateway for each set of users. ;) I'm also not tied to Cisco btw.\n    submitted by    /u/necrofrost76  \n [link]   [comments]",

It works at 10Gb fine to the above Switch using a non-25Gb (SFP+) cable, but as soon as an SFP28 cable is used to that Switch, it doesn't show a connection on either end (NIC or Switch). However, using a regular SFP+ cable, both work fine. And the SFP28 cable works in a different NIC entirely connecting at 10Gb, so the cables are fine. And the NIC itself is fine, since it works at 10Gb perfectly fine (and once at 25Gb fine (I even took a screenshot to show a coworker we were finally at 25Gb internally)).\n However, I'm at a loss at what could cause it no longer working, especially when neither the NIC or the Switch is showing any sort of connection using SF28 a cable. And ESXi shows the connection as \"Down,\" of course.\n And the server is fairly brand new, so I know it has plenty of PCIe lanes to absorb and plenty of empty PCIe slots to use up since dual-CPU server. I think I tried slot 5 and 7 in the server. It initially worked that one time on slot 5 (I think it was in riser 2?), but stopped after a few hours.\n Multiple cables, multiple manufacturers (10GTek coded for Cisco (initial); Macroreer coded for Intel (last resort)).\n Dell will obviously not assistance since the card is aftermarket, but I have 2 and both are doing the same thing in this same server.\n Link for proof it DID work <once>: https://imgur.com/a/33jBzsH\n Any sort of assistance/direction would be greatly appreciated, as I'm clueless at this point.\n    submitted by    /u/marvin83  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys, first of all I'm not a high-level networking engineer, far from it actually, but I know my way around most of the stuff we need to do, and as a lone sysadmin I kind of have to.\n We recently migrated to Nutanix and along with the nodes we got ourselves a pair of new Alcatel OmniSwitch OS6900 TOR switches. Tricky ones to manage, but solid. \n Our old server rack will be decommissioned but our old TOR switches are not that old at all, they're a pair of HP FlexFabric 5700s. Our core switch, on the other hand, is a VERY old HP 5406zl, with rapidly dying PoE ports and a general feeling that the whole thing is going to die soon as well. Switches are still hard to find, so getting new ones would take at least 6 to 10 months. \n So, in the meantime, I'm thinking about replacing the 5400 with the 5700.\n Now, when I say \"core\" switch I do not actually mean it, it's by all intents and purposes an access switch: no l3, no gateway, no nothing. All routing is done through the firewall. All it has connected to it are clients, and a trunk to the TOR switches.\n We would not hit any of the limitations of the 5700 (i.e. the 1024 entry arp-table) but we would gain a healthy new switch.\n Yet, since I constantly doubt myself, I'm asking Reddit: am I missing something here?\n    submitted by    /u/camazza  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have maintained the solution with a very basic level of Cisco knowledge he passed on. We are looking at replacing the devices before we face an outage and are scrambling. We are trying to find a more user-friendly solution that still does the job and thus I seek advice.\n Currently, we have two Cisco 1811 in a data center. Our needs are fairly simple and I have been told in the past we can replace both with a single device these days. We have an Incoming device that has VPNs to the providers and contains all the traffic from field devices. That is connected to the second outgoing CISCO directly and then routes traffic via VPN to various clients based on which devices are theirs.\n Traffic to the internet is restricted with a few exceptions, some IP based, some port-based.\n What replacement device would best meet my needs? Preferably something with a GUI interface instead of the CISCO command lines. \n *edit to add some details*\n My concerns are really just about the two routers into one or needing two.\n At present, I have some IP routes for each client VPN, like below.\n ip route 10.232.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2\n ip route 10.232.24.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2\n ip route 10.232.32.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2\n I also have to NAT everything from one provider's VPN to the client VPN.\n ip nat inside source static 10.232.128.200 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n I don't really care about the brand, just function and something a bit more user-friendly for a fairly entry-level of networking knowledge.\n    submitted by    /u/jlarmour  \n [link]   [comments]",

AP reported that there were several clients connected to it and I figured everything was fine. Turns out things were not fine as the clients (primarily iPads) now consistently disconnect from wireless. Some flat out drop off Wifi and say \"Cannot connect to X network\" or that they can't connect to the Internet and other times they appear to be working but with low signal strength. I think they're going from the Extreme AP to a Cisco one that's in another room across the hall from where the Extreme AP which is really odd since that Cisco AP appears to have really weak signal going into that room. \n ​\n The same SSIDs are configured on both Cisco and Extreme with the same VLANs being attributed to both. We use the same model of Extreme Network APs in another building and they work fine. My guess is that the clients keep trying to connect to the Cisco AP instead of the Extreme but I'm not understanding why when the Extreme AP should have better signal strength vs the Cisco one.

          "description": "OK, first of all, I am still considering this and not sure if I should do it. I am looking for advise if this is feasible at all\n I am a IT professional, but mostly datacenter oriented. I did build some wireless networks; based on UBNT hardware (usually up to 100 people).\n In my free time, I help out NGO's and like wise organization with my expertise. One of those NGOs is organizing a small conference (200-300 people) and have a desire to have a seperated WiFi network and not use the hotel network (1. because hotel networks are not always stable, 2. security is not always up to par/sometimes shared with other guests)\n I am now designing a potential network to see if this project is feasible, as tell them if I can do it or not.\n I am considering UBNT, as I know the software/hardware and it is easy to configure for me. Its a temporary network, so speedy deployment is important, using UBNT will help with that.\n Below is my initial plan and looking for feedback if this will produce a stable enough network: \n There are two floors in play here (F1 & F3, F2 is not used/not part of this) \n Floor 1\n - Room 1: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP\n - Room 2: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP\n - Room 3: 128m2/40 people, 1 AP\n - Attrium, 1600m2, 300 people, 6 AP \n Floor 3\n - 4 rooms of each ~100m2/50 people, 1 AP each \n Total: 13 APs, probably order a few extra to fill in potential gaps. Probably will we rent the equipment. \n People have one or two devices, so I probably need a /22. Disable client-to-client communication, to limit broadcasts/ARP-traffic on the network. Alternative would be to split it in smaller subnets, but people will roam around, so I think that is not convenient. \n Build up time, 1-2 days. It will be running a lot of wires.... \n Looking forward to read that I am crazy to consider this. ;-)\n    submitted by    /u/frozen-sky  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys,\n Someone offhandedly mentioned here that you could order dedicated Att business fiber in order for them help with the cost of running line/build out (they offer 10k budget) then switching to a significantly cheaper shared business fiber plan once the circuit was in place, is that really a thing? I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, \"The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term.\" Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don't need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. \n  \n Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place. Just not really sure if dedicated circuit can be repurposed for shared later on with a setup like ours. \n Thank for any insight\n    submitted by    /u/Ovulating_Oyster  \n [link]   [comments]",

It maintains count of how many people are accessing it.\n I have a few remote employees who VPN into my network. In order to access the software they change a few settings in the SKM files per their (SKMs) direction, log into the VPN, and it sees the license, good to go. Except one employee.\n For some reason this one employee cannot \"see\" the network license once he is logged into the VPN. I went over to his house, brought my laptop, connected to the VPN, only to have the same issue. My laptop could not \"see\" the license either. \n I have spoke at length with SKM about the issue and have tried every recommendation on their end. They have simply chalked it up to some network issue, which I'm beginning to agree with after troubleshooting. \n The license uses something to check and i go to localhost:1947 to check. Not sure what this changes, just stating it as a fact. I've tried looking into the network adapter settings, etc. but I really don't know if what I do will help as I'm not that informed on networking issues. \n For the record, server side and user side firewalls are all off.

There's a whole bunch of other stuff happening with it (like how I can't ping any VSI - even if they're up) but the most baffling to me is that I can't ping the loopback address at all. \n It's a Cisco 3850 stack with 7 members. 1 master, 1 standby, and 5 line cards. I have Loopback0 configured with an IP of 10.0.255.4 and no matter what, I cannot ping it. Even if I console into the router and use \n ping 10.0.255.4 source Lo0 \n it times out. Isn't the loopback supposed to be working, even if nothing else is? All it has is the ip address command in its config. \n Additionally, I can't ping ANY VSI on the device, even though all of them are up. We have a few dozen and they've all been working as expected, but starting this morning we can't ping any of them. Here's an example :\n  Interface Vlan148 ip address 10.0.148.1 255.255.255.192 no ip redirects no ip unreachables no ip proxy-arp  \n There's also some netflow commands but they're long and I didn't really feel like typing them out. I doubt they're relevant. \n Anyway, a computer under Vlan148 (148.17) cannot ping its gateway (148.1) yet it DOES have full access to the whole network internal and outbound. I'm completely lost. \n Even more weirdly, the device (when console'd in) can't ping anything itself, yet still sends SNMP logs, registers devices in the arp cache, creates OSPF neighbor entries, etc. \n This is just so strange. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n EDIT: Partially resolved the issue. Turns out VRRP was causing this somehow, as disabling the VSIs that use VRRP fixed the issue. Tomorrow I'll have to figure out why exactly VRRP did this, but for now, it's resolved.\n    submitted by    /u/scp-507  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Netflix has a fictionalized account of the development of Spotify called The Playlist. The story is told through the eyes of different stake holders: The founder, the music industry, a lawyer, including an Engineer. While fictionalized, the series does seem to be based on real characters, real events, and what seems to be real tech issues/hurdles. \n Spoiler alert if you want to watch this. One of the technical breakthroughs per the story seems to be using lossy streaming where they accept a small amount of packet loss in order to avoid latency. I presumed all streaming services do this, but of course Spotify development started in the mid-ish 2000’s and maybe they were one of the first. At any rate, the engineer proclaims this a wholly new protocol that they have patented. But isn’t lossy streaming simply UDP? Can anyone speak to what protocol Spotify supposedly patented (assuming the patent is not also fictionalized)?\n    submitted by    /u/youtellmebob  \n [link]   [comments]",

Are you just leaving a Firewall with an Ethernet switch and a UPS for the corporate users users to join a LAN while doing site-site VPN to the data center with a xfinity line or is there some new hotness to get this done? SD-WAN seems overkill for us.\n ​\n The corporate office is very close to a data center in Atlanta so ping would be <15ms. User count in the office would be 15 tops, and they currently all use (including all of our servers) a single 100/100Mbit line confirmed with no congestion issues. New data center connection to the world would be gigabit, so plenty of bandwidth there.\n Do people still typically leave behind a DC and a NAS? Nothing but a firewall? Direct connect? We run light SQL loads, AD and VOIP, that's about it. There are two other corporate offices in the US connected via site-site VPN and the other sites are OUs in Active Directory. In each site, there is a physical DC as well as virtual on esxi - and esxi obviously hosts all of our servers in each site. There is no shared storage for esxi, it's all local to each site. Considering moving to RD Gateway model for the users who have been used to local LAN speeds for all applications as some are a bit rough via WAN (such as document management).\n Thanks for any ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/Budget-CaterpillarJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want this secondary link to advertise the LAN networks learned from the local L3 LAN switches, but I want to use the reliability metric at this duel circuit location to make routes advertised from the secondary links a feasible successor. \n All Routers in the EIGRP WAN are only configured to consider the Default metrics (BANDWIDTH/LOAD) when calculating the best path.\n Now, describing this in writing has already made me feel like the answer is \"no\" because the other EIGRP neighbors would not use this new metric when calculating the best path. It may make more sense to modify the LOAD metric. I think this would mean the routes may not be installed as feasible successors, but they would be used if the primary Router failed. \n What are your thoughts and ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/Skaffen-_-Amtiskaw  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each location has a BGP AS number... all in the 65000 private range (at least as far as I understand it). \n So I guess what I'm asking is does anyone have a resource I can read and study up on using BGP as a primary internal routing protocol? I have googled iBGP but man... the amount of info out there is nuts. It's so much to the point I dont even know where to begin reading...\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Avionticz  \n [link]   [comments]",

I even had a bug that TAC said \"We will wait until someone reports this bug to see if code comes out to fix it\" when THEY discovered the bug with me while working on the case. I asked if THEY might be the right team to report said bug and they blew me off. I don't need anything crazy -10G uplinks, 48-1G ports, stackable. Right now I'm running 9200 switches and was looking for recommendations. \n I'm leaning toward HP/Aruba but need to dig into which model is closest to these 9200s and want to stay away from anything that handcuffs you with licensing (I.E. charges you to make a 1G port a 10G). Any recommendations? I'll end up with about 350 spread out across all of my remote sites so I wanted to buy a few now and plug them in on an upcoming small project to get some time with them.

          "description": "So the question I have relates to Cisco Jabber. The User (or Users) can make calls from Jabber going from Jabber on his laptop to External company numbers. However they are not able to contact Internal company numbers.\n Naturally someone said it sounds like a routing issue. (Most of the company has Jabber working this is a new group being stood up working from vpns)\n User(who is on a vpn) can ping all the way into the Datacenter to the call manager server, I can ping from the switch the server is connected to, to the User PC. I can ping both directions from the Data Center Backbone switch. Routing seems to work. \n ​\n So here's my thoughts. If they are able to talk to external numbers then the traffic has to go all the way into the datacenter anyways and hit the server before going back out again. Also from what I saw in emails of previous troubleshooting the Jabber Client on the PC is saying connected as far as registering with the server goes.\n (also for your knowledge I'm mainly from networking side of the house, we have a separate dept for the phone stuff so typically don't get too much into phone issues most of the time.)\n ​\n Jabber Outgoing - > External Number - Works\n Jabber Incoming<- External Number - Works\n Jabber Outgoing -> Internal Number - Not Work\n Jabber Incoming -> Internal Number - Not Work\n ​\n Any thoughts of what more to look into or questions I should ask?\n    submitted by    /u/BeemanIT  \n [link]   [comments]",

We would prefer (though this is not essential) a single box and something that does not require subscriptions. One of the key requirements is that the stack has no single point of failure as we need to meet high uptime guarantees and so I am looking for something with a redundant power supply (I suppose 2 cheaper switches might be ok). We also need to be able to access the device management interfaces (iDRAC, IPMI) of devices on the internal network remotely and so need to have some facility to create a VPN (this seems preferable to a jump host). So, the requirements are: 1) Redundant power supply 2) Firewall 3) VPN 4) 10GbE minimum (SPF+ is preferred to RJ45) 5) <10 ports required\n Our main issue is that everything available that has redundant PSUs has 40+ ports and costs $$$. We only really need a single WAN port and 5 LAN ports (make that 10 to allow for expansion). Techbuyer have a useful product filter here: https://www.techbuyer.com/uk/catalog/category/view/s/network-switch-selector/id/482/ but all the results are switches with 40+ ports.

          "description": "I oversee a few campus networks where each campus currently has 1 subnet/network for voice and data that spans multiple buildings.\n I'd like to create a VLAN (200) specifically for the phones but use a unique subnet per building. This will allow us to tell the phone system if network = 1.0.1.0/24 use e911 number 555-555-0001.\n Building A (with the firewall) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.1.0/24\n Building B (uplinks to Building A) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.2.0/24\n Building C (uplinks to either Building A or B) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.3.0/24 \n Currently all Buildings have a 'data' VLAN (1) using the subnet 1.0.0.0/24 \n IIRC, this can be done via VLAN Mapping or Translation? Not something i've every used. Unfortunately, our HPE OfficeConnect (1820/1920 mostly) switches don't seem to support this. (I hate these switches) \n My first thought was to create a VLAN on the firewall per building with a DHCP scope/relay and somehow convert that VLAN to the same phone vlan on the switch. However, I realized this isn't easily doable - I could connect two untagged ports together to accomplish this but, ew. \n My next thought would be to utilize the switches to handle VLAN 200 and set up a DHCP relay (our switches won't act as DHCP servers (nor do i think i want to manage that..) I believe all of our switches are Layer 3 lite - allowing for routing. This would work but i'd have to let the voice traffic traverse the data network and add in routes on the firewall to point to each network switch.. it sounds messy. \n Is there a solution that I'm not seeing to accomplish this?

However, for the router to connect to the ISP over this SFP modem, it requires tagging a VLAN on the WAN interface.\n If we were to set the SFP and RJ45 ports to access ports to some random VLAN - e.g. 2000, and then set the router to tag VLAN2 on the WAN port, would the switch see the VLAN2 tag on these access ports and then just strip the VLAN tag?\n One of our other options is just a SFP to RJ45 media converter, but then that requires extra plugs, and an extra point if failure, not to mention more cost rather than just plugging the SFP into a switch and partitioning the switch out, not as costly as a router but a cost that the client would need to bear.\n Alternatively, we could just upgrade all of our clients to routers with SFP ports, but then we're going to need to convince the clients to put the money in to upgrade their routers in the cases where they don't already have routers with SFP ports.\n Any opinions on the best way forward while still being cost efficient?\n Thanks all!\n    submitted by    /u/SirLagz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently, it's a flat network 192.168.1.1 /24 with our 48 port switch on eth1 port of ubiquiti edgerouter 4. The switch has multiple desktops(~10) and printers connecting to some win servers (setup as a terminal server). The voip phones would be added at each station sitting in front of the respective desktop on the same line. In order to power the phones, a second poe switch will be added as well.\n  \n 1) Firstly, should I be plugging one switch into another daisy chain style so the phones can see the SBC controller I've setup on the win server? In doing so, all uplink data will be running through a single shared 1GB line which is not great but it's only 10 u…",

          "description": "Hey folks, I maintain a small coaxial cable TV plant for a campus with a few dormitory buildings (about 400 rooms total). It's really simple with the CATV headend (digital QAM modulator) and we pipe in our licensed channels to it in addition to a few in house channels for signage and information. We're making a new dormitory that will be all ethernet and no coax to the room to use simple digital CATV enabled TVs. \n It appears the hospitality IPTV market is large from fancy ones that have splash pages that welcome you with customized information to your room. I do notice that at the hotels a lot of them have set top boxes behind the hospitality TV and this seems complex. I feel like buying hospitality grade smart TVs will lock us in or perhaps the set top box is the way to go? How much do these systems cost to maintain and license? is it even worth it?\n I really like the simplicity of coax CATV, just scan for new channels (the channel plan rarely changes) and go, so I can just push to get coax installed in the new dorm to each room and extend CATV to the dorm with HFC fiber. Change my mind?\n One possible driving factor for IPTV is to also allow users to watch IPTV on their desktop or mobile devices. I can technically hit the multicast IP on the distribution side (source to QAM modulator) and watch it in VLC but it's not too user friendly. I don't know how many users would actually watch our channels on mobile. I have tested Haivison's HMP product and have always wondered if there are competition products to this. Is there anything open source in this space at all?\n    submitted by    /u/woodcake  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're being charged $400 a month for the 50x50 line itself (In the city), along with additional costs for things like a managed firewall. We've had stability issues quite frequently in the past with this line, but the stability seems to be better now. \n 50mb/s is not meeting our needs though. I understand the high cost is to guarantee these minimum speeds, though our speeds don't seem to really ever go above that. A shared line could give us 20 times the speeds for a quarter of the price. I would think that the 50mb/s is a minimum amount of bandwidth we'd get, shouldn't we still be able to get higher speeds despite them not being guaranteed? Or are we being capped at that 50mb mark? It seems like that 50mb/s minimum is our maximum, which seems a bit absurd. I'm not really sure if we're being throttled at that bandwidth. \n If spectrum doesn't throttle dedicated lines at their guaranteed speeds, I suppose another cause may be the managed firewall that we have with them. It seems to be an older model, and from my knowledge it is performing tasks like Deep Packet Inspection. \n We also use a shared building, with 2 other tenants in it. By paying for a dedicated line, would the other tenants in the building be using that line? From the agreement we signed, it looks like there are 3 address entries with the same address, so it seems plausible that we may not be getting that dedicated access, and that this may be a cost we should talk to the landlord about. \n These are the theories I've come up with so far. I understand the value/cost associated with getting dedicated speeds, but it seems like we're pretty much being limited at these speeds.

How can I get my IP routes to follow my NAT map properly?\n I've been one the phone with my ISP and they've told me they cannot disable this dynamic NAT and that they really don't even have anymore control than I do.\n    submitted by    /u/Operations-  \n [link]   [comments]",
