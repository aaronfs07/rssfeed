          "description": "SUMMARY\nIn 2022, LockBit was the most deployed ransomware variant across the world and continues to be prolific in 2023. Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in obse…",

I love to fully understand how the things I use works and you problably saw the problem coming, sys/network admin is an ocean and I think I'm drowning.\n One solution will be to just take time but I don't have much choice, I've to do a thesis for my school, and it have to be about a projet in my entreprise (RADIUS implementation + 802.1X). Big problem is, in my entreprise I don't really have a \"mentor\", honestly I don't need someone who know everything but just explain me what do we have in the entreprise and how things connect each other. All I have is a lot of doc scattered.\n Balance between learn the basics, search what I've in my entreprise and understand how it works is really diffucult. I don't want to complain about how life is difficult lmao, I've no choice but keep going however do you guys have advice to manage everything ?

          "description": "TLDR: How does Windows identify known networks?\n ​\n I use Microsoft Always-On VPN, and it uses trusted network detection to determine if it's on or off-prem. Sounds good. It's supposed to use the DNS suffix issued by the DHCP to determine that. Except, it doesn't... It seems to actually use the \"friendly name\" of the network, and therein lies the problem.\n ​\n My internal dns suffix is ad.company.com. I also have wireless for corp-owned devices, which hands out the same suffix. So, random users' laptops may create new known networks with names like \"Corp Wifi 2\" or \"ad.company.com 5\" and can use them interchangeably regardless of whether the device is hardwired or on wireless. Since AOVPN seems to want to use the friendly names instead of the dns suffix like the MS docs say it uses, clients will randomly decide that they're off-prem and connect to the VPN server when they're on-prem breaking any access to internal resources. My temporary workaround has been to blackhole any connections to the VPN server from within the network, but that's causing other weird issues and delays in accessing network resources, though it ultimately does work.\n ​\n But you say, \"just use GPO to create a network profile so the name doesn't change!\" I'm sure you're absolutely correct, but when I'm creating the GPO, it appears to only let me select existing known networks on my computer, and it seems that I too have had those weird incremented network names in the past.\n ​\n Ultimately, my question is, how in the world is Windows fingerprinting the network, and why is it thinking the exact same network is a different one? Looking in the Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\NetworkList\\Profiles\\ registry hive where that info seems to live, I don't see anything like DNS suffixes, subnets, or anything other information that would be used to uniquely identify my corporate network.\n    submitted by    /u/smalltimesysadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

This delay is about 5 minutes from our testing but once it has happened and the password box appears then all is fine from then on, no other slowdowns at all. This happens to servers both on the same site and remotely.\n While the delay is happening, there is a screen in the background that you cannot interact with or click to have appear, only if you hover over it from the taskbar do you see it. A screenshot of which is linked here: https://imgur.com/a/9XDdwDH.\n If we delete the cache for RDP (as noted here: https://www.tachytelic.net/2019/01/clear-rdp-cache/) then it works once as normal but the delay occurs again on subsequent connections until the cache is cleared again.

However, I have come up with several issues:\n 1. For some of these tasks, like the inbox monitoring script, I need them to run continuously in the background, and for some of them I need specific time scheduling (run between this and this date)\n 2. 1. For some of these tasks, I need to implement some stopping clauses (ie. events that terminate these tasks external to the list of events provided by WTS). An example of such, is when some specific file was saving into a folder (the background tasks keeps checking the existence of that folder continuously/periodically) or when an environment variable is modified following another user manipulation.\n 3. It is easy for the user to shut the task by mistake, and I have little to no traceability of these tasks in WTS\n My question is: Do I need to consider a virtual machine or setting up a container (using Windows containers or Docker) to achieve a better orchestration of these tasks? The goal is to have a clearer overview of all the tasks that are running, their state (terminated, failed or running) as well as ensure that I can implement some stopping clauses for these tasks.\n Any help would be much appreciated.

Those vms are not in any way managed by IT, so no av or other hardening that is usually enforced via policy.\n We have different vlans for prod and dev but i can't think of way to enforce that the vm is only allowed into dev vlan as the employeen could just change the interface in virtualbox, hyper-v etc. \n The end result should be that employee device and the vm's should be in different vlans. Maybe someone here went through something similiar like this and has some input?\n Well, thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Any_Impression4238  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long story short its related to blocking USB Devices, BUT allow certain ones.\n ​\n We are running a hybrid AD to make things even more fun. Company has never used Intune further than to test it for Mobile devices, but now wants to use it just for the USB issue. We are also running a inventory program that is doing all the heavy lifting, which should stay that way. Does Intune screw with inventory programs?\n I have looked on a few microsoft resources already, but non have been able to solve the issue.\n ​\n I did try to join a device via corperate portal but since the device is already AD joined it wont let me past the domain join page.

          "description": "Hello, \n In our current situation we have a large portion of our infrastructure being managed by the IT department of our parent company. Everything down to the ESXI hosts are their responsibility, while the virtual servers of our factories are our own responsibility. This works reasonably well, although I wouldn't mind having my own team doing the managing like I am used to at other jobs (lets just say we have had our issues with the IT department, like them running WEP SSID's till end 2022). \n Anyway, when we run a project we request a new virtual server, they deploy one via a template and we get on our way. We use their KMS server to activate our Windows products and occasionally when there is Office on the server installed to activate that too. \n Now we run into the situation that we are most likely being sold. The IT manager of our parent company informed us today that they do not want to assist with creating new servers (requested 10 more) because when moving to the new owner they expect us to create new servers with them and moving the application and data over, and not move the virtual servers itself. \n The servers run in our own domain separate from the parent company, meaning they have no cached administrative credentials or anything like that saved on our VMs that could potentially leak. Their reasoning for migrating applications + data rather than the VM itself is because of Windows licensing. But from my limited experience with KMS a Windows server will contact the KMS to renew their activation every X months. Surely we could simply release the current licenses being assigned to our servers via KMS, switch over to the KMS of the new owner and bobs your uncle? \n Or does KMS licensing work differently? \n Any insight would be appreciated! \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Dennis-sysadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

This would not normally be allowed, but hey ho. \n The mitigation i am putting in place are these : \n Firewall rule to only allow a connection from the static local IP of his device on the RDP port\n Preventing drive mapping.\n Preventing Clipboard. \n To achieve this it appears a local group policy can be created. This policy then changes the following keys: \n HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server - DisableDriveRedirection = 1\n HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Terminal Services - fDisableCdm =1\n HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server - DisableClipboardRedirection = 1\n HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Terminal Services - fDisableClip = 1 \n I have enabled all of these however I'm still able to connect with local drives mounted from the off domain device to the on domain device, aswell as access the data on them. \n The goal is to prevent file transfer and copy + paste. \n I may be missing something really obvious. I'm deploying the reg keys via intune, I'm aiming to avoid local GP so that if the user changes device or moves to a new one the settings are deployed down. \n Thanks all in advice, Sorry if this is a really obvious solution, It may be a case of getting in too deep and not being able to see the trees from the woods. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/emile1920  \n [link]   [comments]",

These servers need to connect to the internet so you can use them, I make sure these connections all work fast and for 1000s of devices”\n Really the launching point of this question is someone in my family equated data center with warehouse which made them think I was basically moving around boxes. This prompted them to ask if I was a manager or warehouse manager and when I said no they said that our other relative could put a good word in at the candy factory they work at that I should consider it. \n I understand not knowing the ins and outs of a job because most people don’t know that for most jobs but to not even have a high level concept of it was a bit mind boggling especially since they equated it to something very random. \n So how does everyone else explain what they do to non-tech/IT/etc folks and more importantly do people actually understand at all?\n    submitted by    /u/bender_the_offender0  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would assume that the ISP (or any company that offers subscription based billing) would only take in 1 email as their main point of contact for the company. So I'm having a hard time figuring out a way to delegate those billing emails through distribution lists or shared mailboxes.\n I would like to be enlightened on how stuff like these usually goes for other companies. I get that my email was used because I am the SysAd and will be the ISP's point of contact but I'm pretty sure the billing shouldn't be put into my inboxes no?\n In addition how should emails be setup if there would be another SysAd personnel added, how would that work out?\n    submitted by    /u/Pure-Pause-1463  \n [link]   [comments]",

The IT staff all have secondary admin accounts that have admin access to their laptops, these are also active directory accounts. \n Now for the issue, we all WFH at least three days a week which is great. However, there seems to be an issue with Windows 11 caching the credentials for our standard accounts. Let's say I work from the office on Monday, on Tuesday morning I can turn on my laptop at home and log in with my standard account just fine and connect to the VPN and work the entire day without issue. At the end of the day, I disconnect from the VPN and shut down my laptop or maybe I just lock it after disconnecting as I will be using it the next day (this is the most common). The next morning when I attempt to log on I receive the message that I cannot be logged in because my domain cannot be reached. The following is the process I have to go through to get logged in with my standard account.\n Log in with my admin account (for some reason this works just fine off the network, most likely due to being a local admin account)\n Connect to the VPN while logged in with my admin account\n Switch user and log in with my standard account\n Once logged in with my standard account, reboot the laptop, log back in with my standard account, reconnect to the VPN, and begin my day.\n This was not an issue on previous Windows 10 and 7 laptops so I am not sure what is causing this on 11, and it seems like it has gotten worse with recent updates.

Looking back at the same report for May we can see these started on 14th May. Normal daily inbound email values for us are around 10,000 and we can see these hitting 100,000+ through this period.\n Having dug into the rejections deeper using the info within Reporting -> CSV in the Mimecast portal it reads like a DDoS attack with multiple source IP addresses and randomised FROM addresses. The TO addresses are also randomised, so it doesn’t seem like a targeted attack from that point of view.\n Our main concern is that the TO domains extend to all our domains within both our Mimecast and 365 tenant, some of which are not in the wild as such and would normally see very few inbound emails. It’s as though someone had a complete list of our domains and sent high amounts of email to randomised addresses in a DoS attempt. Mimecast did its thing as these were rejected due to the sending IPs being in RBLs.\n We’re trying to determine whether this was unique to our organisation or whether Mimecast customers as a whole were targeted.\n Did anyone else experience this at all?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/brepmassive  \n [link]   [comments]",

We would only expect to move the primary drive which is usually no more than 1TB in size, average is 500GB.\n As this will be a large task for our small team to migrate the data from the existing drive to a new drive-through normal (home user) imaging tools the work is expected to take a few weeks or months to complete for all 1000 systems. \n A few considerations we are still uncertain on:\n  \nIf any suggestions on professional imaging tools are there for moving the content from the old (HDD) physical drive to the new (SSD) drive that can give us a rollout of maybe 100 systems per day over network backup/restore imaging methods then we can consider this. Have any approached something like this procedure before?\n If we are buying the SSDs in bulk as all the same model and capacity, we should not expect much fuss from Windows OS in the hardware imaging process as no other components (like motherboard, GPU, etc.) are being changed right?\n Should we expect potential data loss from bad sectors in existing HDDs being cloned to SSDs, maybe OS blue screen errors as the data might not be perfect in the old HDD?\n Any other precautions we should expect if we plan to do this in-house?\n  \nWe are considering outsourcing this task to a vendor for fixed SLAs and agreements and having our users up and running in a known timeline with the least amount of downtime.

Especailly when that particular customer is top of the food chain?\n I have one of the directors complaining at me regularly about how things just dont work and how it used to be better (before I showed up and 'changed everything')\n The things he like to complain about is MS Teams for starters, sharepoint, onedrive etc. He also has trouble with different headsets/speakers/devices any time theres a meeting and its somehow my fault too. A website I have nothing to do with was 'hanging' today and thats also my problem or the fualt of the brand new high spec laptop that was issued to him a month or so ago. Even things like searching for email being a pain in the outlook client (doesnt seem to search archived items) but working fine in OWA. \n I think he just likes to complain, and im happy to stand and fight my corner, the other 100+ employees have no trouble, but this guy is impatient and unwilling to learn. Its frustrating to deal with, as much as its frustrating for him to feel like hes being held up by these technologies.\n I guess i dont know what im asking and am venting as much as anything else... does anyone else deal with this? Im lucky in that I dont repot to this guy, I think id have left pretty sharpish if that was the case.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable-Tourist1  \n [link]   [comments]",

To make it more clear let's say we have 'Project A', 'Project B', 'Project C' folders. They sit directly under the 'Projects' PF. What the customer doesn't want is to have a 'ProjectS.pst' file from which he could scroll through the folder hierarchy, no. What he wants is to have a pst-file for 'Project A.pst', 'Project B.pst', which only opens the folder structure he needs at that moment.\n Do you guys have any ideas?

The only time I have to check in/on the properties and deal with any updates/changes are for extra assistance.\n Those of you who worked in the Hotel IT, or any of the 'travel niche' side of the business, what are your general thoughts on the industry as a whole? \n Thank you for your comments in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Jaded-IT  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few weeks ago we started getting reports of certain computers not waking up properly. Upon investigating, my techs found that the computers (Optiplex 7090 micros) would be normal sleep mode, and moving the mouse caused the power light to go solid and the fan to spin up, then... nothing. We got about 10 reports of this, out of a fleet of at least 50 of that model among our branch offices.\n There had been a recent BIOS update, so we tried rolling it back. That seemed to help for one or two boots, then back to the original problem. We pulled one of the computers, gave the employee a loaner, and started a deeper investigation. \n So many tests. Every power setting in Windows and BIOS. Windows 10 vs Windows 11, M.2 Drives vs SATA, RST vs AHCI, rolling back recent updates... The whiteboard filled up with things we tried. Certain things would seem to work, then the computer would adapt like Borg to a phaser and the wake issue would recur.\n After a clean Windows install, one of my techs noticed that it seemed to only happened when the computer was joined to the domain. We checked into that, and sure enough, that was the case. Ok, a weird policy issue, finally getting somewhere. There was only one policy dealing with power, so we disabled that. No change.\n Finally, we created an Isolation Ward OU, and started adding GPOs one by one. Finally one seemed to be causing the wake issue... but it made no sense. It was a policy that ran a script on shutdown, that logged information to the Description field in Windows- Computer name, serial number, things like that. No power policies, it didn't even run on wake.\n We tested it thoroughly, and it seems definitive: A shutdown policy, that runs a script to log a few lines of system information, was causing a wake from sleep issue, but only on a subset of a specific model of a computer.\n My head hurts.\n    submitted by    /u/JasonMaggini  \n [link]   [comments]",

One for desktop, one for laptops. The desktops are 8th and 9th gen Intel CPUs, where the laptops are 8th to 11th gen Intel CPUs. I am using DISM to apply and capture images, and I sysprep the images. These are all \"thin\" images, just Windows 10 that was installed on them and decrapified/customized to our liking to get rid of OEM bloatware and keep the image size down. We will add to domain and install SCCM, etc later. Any reason to keep more than one image for each type of hardware/manufacturer? I know sysprep generalizes the image, removing hardware identifiers and such, and Windows 10 is pretty forgiving when it comes to different hardware. I just need to run Updates on the hardware after imaging, which I am already doing, correct? I tried googling this, but maybe not phrasing it correctly and just would like some advice from veterans.

They do not have internet and due to no postcode can not get anything installed, the only power is at the \"Office/Shed/Shop\".\n I am famililarwith homelab software and IP cameras but wondering if this is the right solution? It needs to be simple to manage as well as the site managers are mostly retired and not tec savy. It would need to have decent storage 3-7 days rolling recording I think, and mutliple cameras, first thoughts are one on each corner and one inside. Should I use IP cameras and install a wireless router and POE setup or maybe look to use a coaxle setup instead?\n Site Image: https://imgur.com/a/24P7RPi \n Let me know your thoughts\n    submitted by    /u/pobrika  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hyia, we're currently moving to a new school site and this will be the occasion to rearrange configuration and settings.\n We currently have these VLANs:\n  \nCore: Servers and on premise trusted workstations\n Staff: BYOD and mobile phones\n Guest: Students and guests\n Printers: to allow selected VLANs to print\n PBX: as it says\n  \nNow, apart from adding a videosurveillance system, which will use its own VLAN, we're wondering if it makes sense to separate servers (Active Directory) from on premise trusted workstations. \n What we would achieve: \n  \nSecurity: By segregating servers and workstations, you create a logical separation between them. This helps in implementing stricter security policies and access controls. Even if the server firewall is compromised, an attacker would still need to bypass additional security measures to gain access to the workstations' network.\n Reduced Attack Surface: Placing servers and workstations on separate VLANs limits the exposure of critical server resources to potential threats originating from workstations. It minimizes the attack surface, reducing the chances of unauthorized access, data breaches, or lateral movement within the network.\n Performance Optimization: Servers often require more bandwidth and have different traffic patterns compared to workstations. By segregating them on separate VLANs, you can prioritize and optimize network resources for server traffic, ensuring efficient communication and reducing the risk of congestion caused by workstation-related traffic.\n  \nNow thinking of the extra complexity layer added by the above setup. Implementing Inter-VLAN Routing, to allow for controlled communication between VLANs. By selectively permitting specific traffic between VLANs, you can ensure that essential services, such as DNS, DHCP, domain authentication, print queues, and file shares, remain accessible to workstations but this might be a long trial and error process\n Your thoughts? \n    submitted by    /u/_ReeX_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Friday I got pulled in all different directions all because a staff member didn't realize a power adapter and outlet was not working and they had to keep their laptop charged.

I'm looking for a career change for a few reasons, 1) moar money, duh. 2) WFH FTW!. 3)More options in the future.\n We're all familiar with the dead end tech support, customer support positions so I'm not gonna go into that rant/vent here. As I've always learn by doing, I hardly have certificate/certifcations under my belt to show for what I can do.\n What I can do: recently got CCNA, CCNP is well within reason. LPIC-1 is probably low hanging fruit too, might strive for LPIC-2. Most recent dabbling with python & powershell. Not a front end guy, but back end, bring it on.\n So, I'm going to hunker down and get certs to try and get myself another position. The way I see it, I can either go into product customer support, which would somewhat limit myself to my employer's products, but that can be lucrative. Or go into DevOps/SRE/Data Analyst.\n Any advice on which to focus on, or something else I'm not aware of, and the path to it, that'll be great. WFH is definitely a must for me, as I planned to WFH and move some place with lower cost of living before my current job which doesn't allow WFH. If I can manage to double employ down the road, even better.\n So lay it on me, guys.\n    submitted by    /u/x_m_n  \n [link]   [comments]",

First time posting here, I hope it’s not a duplicate.\n I’ve been desperately trying to figure out a solution to this issue that was assigned to me by my senior team member, thus leading me here.\n We have two Synology NAS (DS920+), each loaded with 14TBx4 disks. The first one is used as main storage, we got the same one to expand our storage, and I figured it’s easier from a client’s pov to have both NASes joined together as a whole storage.\n What i came up with was mount both nfs shares on a VM, unify them with mergerfs and then re-export from VM. It worked but as my senior team member said it’s a single point of failure, therefore I duplicated the VM then spawned another one as a load balancer (HAProxy), but in the end it did not work as NFS refused to mount the LB IP.\n I want to know if it’s possible to unify them under a shared volume or one NFS export.\n I heard about Ganesha and gluster fs but I did not find anything or anyone using it for a similar use case of mine.\n Does anyone have an idea how to scale out nas synology?

I configured it based on the configuration of the switch that went bad. I could have swore it was a /23 network.\n This, of course, was a weekend, and come Monday we had endpoints with “stuck” IP addresses that refused to renew, and weird SIP problems where calls went through without problem, but conversations were suddenly muted. I suspected a NAT problem so I went on the hunt. Two days later I still found nothing and felt defeated.\n So, there are a number of issues that lead to this, many of which “existed before me”, but I’m here now and the bottom line is it was my fault. The big boss figured it out and all I could do was slap myself on the forehead. It was originally a /24 network. We reconfigured the PBX and all downstream appliances to use a /23 space. Within 10 minutes all was well.\n Lesson learned was always verify the IP space you are working in. I could have saved myself a lot of time, frustration and embarrassment.\n BTW: I know this is more netadmin stuff. Like many of us my sysadmin duties really run the gamut.

          "description": "So, our engineers have been tasked with setting up a 12 server (Windows 2019 Server) environment to run software for a manufacturing plant. These were likely member servers that were dis-joined from their domain and placed within their own domain. One of the tasks I was given was to harden the security via GPOs. \n The second I popped into Group Policy Editor, I was greated with a warning that was something to the effect that it couldn't sync (I forgot exactly what it was when I looked at it yesterday). It does appear that it retained some of the previous policies from the previous domain. I created some of the policies like not allowing anonoymous logins and basic objects of that sort, but some of them lost out on the winning GPO that was in place. I deleted a few of them, but they are sticking on the other servers creating issues with service accounts that the software needs to run. I even tried writing new policies to reverse them, but am still having issues with them sticking. \n I know the proper thing to do would be to rebuild the entire domain, but we don't have the time frame given to us to complete. I'm probably just overthinking this, but is there a way to rip everything out and redo all of the policies? TIA!!!\n    submitted by    /u/BleedCheese  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our storage arrays are a Dell VNXe 3200 which is long out of support and a Unity 300 and HPE Nimble that are going up next year. My original thought was to replace all of it with a new HCI cluster but there is a fear that it's \"too much\" for our environment of about 40 VMs. As a result, I've been asked to look into a traditional SAN solution to replace it instead. \n Considering what we have, the most cost-effective option would seem to replacing all 3 storage arrays with 2 new storage arrays, keeping the R740xd's while dropping the 3 other hosts, and adding in one new host. It would be the minimum amount of hardware to replace and while it kicks the can down the road on our remaining hosts, we'd have over two years before they need to be replaced.\n Any thoughts or other suggestions that I may be overlooking?\n    submitted by    /u/vtvincent  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I was wondering what everyones offboarding procedure is. We are running on-prem AD synced to Azure with AD connect. Moving towards making the on-prem ad redundant. But it takes time and it's still used for servers and a bunch of legacy stuff. Either way our offboarding procedure is just weird to me. It works, bjt we have a tonne of disabled users and the number only grows. \n Currently our procedure is as follows:\n  \n Right away:\n  \nUser is disabled disabled\n \nPassword is reset reset\n \nuser is removed from all groups (effectivly removing licences as this is applied using groups)\n \nuser is added to a single group that gives them an exchange online plan 1 license license\n \nuser is converted to a shared mailbox\n \n -1 other user gets access to their mailbox and 1 forward is made. To the same user or another user( chosen by the manager)\n  \n After 2 months:\n  \nadd old_ prefix to users mail address and UPN UPN\n \nremove delegation and forward\n \n  \n Now i guess my question is, at what point do we just delete the user account? Security are worried that deleting a user will also remove them from our sentinel and other logs. Or at least make it harder to trace the logs. But at some point i think that this is irrelevant. Nobody investigates 12months + old logs?\n How do ylu habdle offboarding?\n    submitted by    /u/gahd95  \n [link]   [comments]",

I feel like I am technically pretty good but I find myself having tasks or tickets being open for weeks because I can't distribute my time on them efficiently. I often spent several days focused on a task and the others get procrastinated on. I feel I could work straight for weeks and never run out of work and I can never shake off the feeling that I'm not being efficient. My question is, how do you guys manage your time so that there is a healthy balance between your tasks and avoid constantly pushing the \"smaller stuff\" for later?

I've been able to get all the way through registering an image, but I'm stuck at deployment. I'm still trying to figure this thing out, and I feel like I'm missing something simple.\n I'm using VirtualBox to create the VMs for the FOG host, FOG server, and the Windows 11 golden image. The FOG host is Ubuntu Server 22.04, FOG Server is version 1.5.10. DHCP is set to the FOG Server IP in 066, and I have 067 set to snponly.efi. On the golden image, I have generic apps (Chrome, Everything, VLC Player, Office365,) as well as larger installs for SolidEdge and AutoCAD Viewer. I went through sysprep and created an answer file for unattended installation for UEFI, and have a volume license key as well, so I'm covered there. I then was able to successfully register and then capture the image in FOG.\n ​\n Where I'm stuck: I've tried deploying this on a physical desktop as well as a VM, and this is as far as I get:\n Filename: snponly.efi\n thtp://10.xx.xx.xx/snponly.efi... ok\n snponly.efi : 274944 bytes [PXE-NBP (may be EFI?)]\n Nothing happens beyond that point.

          "description": "I do pro bono work for a nonprofit organization. They called me on Wednesday morning and informed me that some websites were not working for all users. Additionally, Outlook had issues. Upon investigation, I discovered that major websites like YouTube and Facebook were displaying SSL certificate errors. In the Chrome web console, I noticed recurring reconnection errors. The organization mentioned that they had recently upgraded their Comcast connection and were told that their modem was outdated. Consequently, I advised them to contact Comcast and request a replacement. A technician replaced the modem, tested it, and confirmed that all sites were functioning properly on his PC.\n However, when I reevaluated the situation tonight, I discovered that connecting a PC directly to the modem resulted in the same issue. Changing the DNS settings did not resolve the problem. After spending two hours troubleshooting, I found a temporary fix by enabling DNS over HTTPS, which resolved the issue for everything except Outlook.\n I am aware that this is not a long-term solution. Based on my best guess, this appears to be an issue with Comcast. However, persuading them to acknowledge and address the problem may prove challenging since they rely on the Comcast modem for DNS and DHCP services. Since not all devices support DNS over HTTPS, I need to find an alternative solution.\n    submitted by    /u/neckbeard404  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If you look at the CQURE Hacks 39 video on YouTube, it shows a quick demo of how easy it is to use pass-the-PRT to steal Azure PRT tokens even on a fully patched Windows system with Credential Guard enabled and TPM protections.\n The attack requires local admin access, but that isn't an insurmountable obstacle.\n Even if the local user doesn't have admin privileges, there are constantly application flaws, driver flaws and OS flaws that can be exploited to allow privilege escalation that would give the attacker local admin rights. Then there is just plain malware and zero day flaws between updates to do this if the attacker gets on a perfectly patched system. Users can be tricked into clicking on malicious links and opening files with malware and there is even occasional malware that requires no user interaction (Malvertisements and Outlook flaws that allow malware to run without even opening the message).\n You can have A/V and EDR to detect and block tools like Mimikatz, but Mimikatz does not need to run locally on the system. In the video, the data is copied to a different system with Mimikatz installed. No hacking tools need to be installed on the system being attacked.\n Besides all that can be done with the local user's Azure credentials to send spam and phishing emails and exfiltrate data, if any device admins had entered their credentials into the system (UAC prompt etc.) to assist the user within the last 14 days, their active PRT will also be on the machine and that would give the attacker access to everything the device admin has access to in the tenant.\n This type of attack gets around credential guard and TPM protections and then bypasses all forms of MFA and passwordless authentication (FIDO2 security keys etc.). So, what protection exists to prevent this?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Real_Lemon8789  \n [link]   [comments]",

Bit of an odd question/thought exercise, but figured I'd ask and see if you all have any thoughts/ideas.\n In Linux, you can use PAM (more specifically, pam_ssh_agent_auth) to authenticate to a machine through the use of an SSH agent, thus bypassing the need for a password. Is there anything like it for Windows, i.e. something which would allow you to authenticate/log-in to a computer upon startup - either bypassing or being used in conjunction with a password or other Windows Hello auth method? \n Without going into too much detail, I've got a working agent, and USB device which stores/generates a pub/priv key pair. Furthermore, I've managed to make an SSH connection to my machine, from my machine. \n Thanks! \n    submitted by    /u/DontGrowAttached  \n [link]   [comments]",

The network/domain infrastructure was built by a contracting company and I swear it was designed to be broken from day one. There are 50+ virtualized servers to manage and I barely know anything about them because I came here two years after the installation and the previous sysadmins were hotshots that only applied bandaid fixes so they couldn’t tell me anything of value. The only people that saw how it ran as intended are long gone and I’m stuck piecing together whatever I can with my limited experience. Getting information out of the contracting company is next to impossible because I have to fight my way through their help desk that of course only answer to emails. And even then they are intentionally vague in order to bait my company to pay extra to go fly over to fix whatever’s wrong. I might as well not even be here. The contractors were supposed to build the network then hire junior techs to maintain it but how am I supposed to maintain anything when it’s all hidden behind a contract. I have full access to the network. Im not just a user with limited access. Yet I feel like im running into a new major issue every week and nothing is ever a quick fix or even something I’ve dealt with before. It almost feels like it was engineered to be complicated and they convinced their clients to hire under qualified techs so they can get more money to fly out and be the “subject matter experts”. I’m so sick and tired of this, it’s actually killed my desire to continue working in this field because I’m being set up left and right by these greedy fucks.\n    submitted by    /u/shaggymink_577  \n [link]   [comments]",

The setting to not logout/disconnect user was already made, but still if I let the window, minimize and work on something else, it shows as idle:\n in cmd: query user /server: MY_SERVER, shows idle after 1 minute of inactivity\n I need to have this active all the time, as a user makes some activity, since I have some scheduled tasks that will run some GUI actions/applications. Also the remote connection will at some point start by itself, if the server gets rebooted or so.\n What I have tried:\n - mouse jiggler\n - caffeine\n - autohotkey scripts (click and pressing keys)\n - powertoys - awake\n -vbs, powershell scripts\n None of them worked. The cmd query still showed idle after one 1 minute\n Am I missing something? Does this have to do with windows being opened (not minimized), or having focus or something else? Is there any tricky thing regarding how windows detects inactivity\n If I have the window not minimized, and something is running (like a mouse jiggler or something) then, the connection is not being shown as idle at all\n Thank you\n ​\n P.S. Hopefully I did not put this into the wrong category. But I did not found one for the remote desktop connection\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/eltigre4jc  \n [link]   [comments]",

The current servers are all Server 2012 and since this OS will be end of support by October 2023, we have created a new deployment with all Server 2022 VM's.\n We provide our applications within the RDP deployment as RemoteApp. Users can acces the RDWeb page through URL cloud.example.com where they have to login and then see the icon(s) of the applications they can use. \n When the new environment is fully functional, we will point the DNS server to the IP address of the new RDWeb server, but we are not yet fully ready for that. When we open the RDWeb from within the server, we can login and start an application, but when we try to do that from outside the environment (by IP address, ie https://123.12.3.4/rdweb/pages/en-US/default.aspx) we still can login to the server but applications won't open. Instead, an error message is shown:\n  \nRemoteApp Disconnected \n Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer \"cb.cloud.example.com\" for one of these reasons: \n 1) Your user account is not authorized to access the RD Gateway \"cloud.example.com\"\n 2) Your computer is not authorized to access the RD Gateway \"cloud.example.com\"\n 3) You are using an incompatible authentication method (for example, the RD Gateway might be expecting a smart card but you provided a password) \n Contact your network administrator for assistance.\n  \n​\n We are not sure why this is happening. Could this be because we are not accessing the environment by the domain cloud.example.com but by IP address?

We are trying to create a strong certificate binding with the AD attribute altSecurityIdentities (issuer + serial number) but it's not working, the event 39 keeps showing after updating the attribute:\n - altSecurityIdentities = 'X509:<I>C=ES,O=(redacted),OU=(redacted),OID.2.5.4.97=(redacted),CN=(redacted)<SR>(inverted SN)'\n We have tried to configure the altSecurityIdentities in several different ways, we have added the certificate to the user on AD and a we have done a lot of different tests, but event 39 keeps appearing, so we are a little bit lost. Do you know where could we investigate further or what could be the cause for event 39 still being logged?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/FarAstronaut9618  \n [link]   [comments]",

The room has no cabinet, old pc cases etc. \n ​\n What I have to do is take the shelves to outside of the room to make up space, build 42U Cabinet, build 2x48 Port switch, couple patch panels, build some rack servers or a workstation. And then move the ups, file server and rest pc's to the cabinet, reconnect them. Remake about 20-30 cable connectors, label each of them. \n ​\n In total cables are about 50 and they only said not to replace the whole cable. Only I can move and make a new connector.\n ​\n The thing is I said to them I would check the parts and prices for them, will not get a commission. \n It is roughly 5-day job and I am not familiar with the market. New in the country(US-CA) so I would have some opinions if you could just guide me.\n ​\n Thanks a lot! \n    submitted by    /u/Rayjon32  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just want to make sure it's not known for being insecure and all that stuff we are paid to worry about.\n Thanks for any input!\n    submitted by    /u/gbubrodieman  \n [link]   [comments]",

As part of the (re)learning process I ended up creating a diagram that I feel breaks it down a bit more thoroughly end-to-end.\n https://digitalredshirts.com/diagrams/kerberos/\n The fonts used in the original Visio didn't make it into the export so some text alignment may be off depending on browser (rendering may be better in Chrome).\n This workflow is probably not 100% accurate and I could use feedback on any corrections or glaring ommissions. I've had to consult a number of books, online blogs, YouTube videos, my own lab packet captures, etc. to figure this out. It's a bit of a visual mess due to the number of moving parts involved but maybe this may be useful to some people and/or they can provide suggestions for improvements.

I tried running the commandline as SYSTEM (psexec -i -s cmd.exe), still access denied.\n I tried some consumer tools to remove it.

Pwning a UPS or some other IoT device can lead to lateral movement, especially when we have no XDR solution and rely only on EDR. I believe some of the issue can come from him being 40 years older than me. He says I go off buzz words too much. Its quite clear he does not like me, and honestly I am ok with that. It just makes my job harder when they dont want to patch internal systems because the risk is not there.\n This makes me feel like I dont know what I am doing.

Nothing special, just a TCP connexion, no TLS, No nothing. Just TCP push. On the server i have a service listening on this specific port. It IS listening we have verified.\n But When users are on-site the connection is dropped by the server ! \n -Connection as ALLOWED by Firewall\n - Network capture mark the connexion cut by my server at the 4th packet of the TCP handshack \n (client->server) SYN\n (server->client) SYN ACK\n (client->server)ACK \n (server->client) ACK-FIN .\n -Activating WFP logs in windows even viewer on the server i saw that the connexion was Stealth-Drop by windows :\n Event ID : 5152\n The Windows Filtering Platform has blocked a packet.\n Application Information:\n Process ID: 0 Application Name: - \n Network Information:\n Direction: Inbound Source Address: IP Source Port: sourceport Destination Address: IP Destination Port: Myport-listening Protocol: 6 \n Filter Information:\n Filter Origin: Stealth Filter Run-Time ID: netsh wfp show state tell me it's \"Port Scanning Prevention Filter\" Layer Name: Transport Layer Run-Time ID: 13 \n ​\n Now , if this was all this could be easy. BUT NO. \n Because it DOES work when the users are connected from their home (ipsec tunnel i think ?)\n but NOT when they are on-site, closer to the server.\n ​\n The port is open, we checked 4 times on our firewalls. The paquets are not modified by the networking equipement. No they really are dropped by windows to \"prevent port Scanning\" but it shouldn't be considered port scanning when the service is listening ???? And why would it WORK or not work depending on client user IP ?\n We even checked with windows defender, firewall and local antivirus disabled but it still behave the same...\n Any idea or i am going mad ? \n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/LegitimateAd2242  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just started doing some work for a customer who has a Windows Storage Server 2016 machine purchased from Dell.\n They would like to upgrade. They purchased Server 2019, licenses and cals (several years ago and its been sitting around collecting dust which is why they brought me on board as a consultant to do the upgrade, previous employee who managed their machines retired to florida during covid lockdowns), but it appears it is not possible to upgrade from Storage Server 2016 to 2019. Only a fresh installation is available on the setup screen.\n This makes sense I guess, since it would be like upgrading DataCenter 2016 to Standard 2019.\n However, the machine is not using any special features of Storage Server. Its just the version that came with the machine because I guess it had a MD1200 array attached to it.\n A fresh install really isn't an option either since there are a few other pieces of software on here (a SQL Server 2019 instance and some CRM software supplied by a 3rd party vendor which runs through IIS and uses the SQL database to store data).\n I am guessing when they got the CRM software w/ SQL 2019, they got the Windows Server 2019 disk to upgrade and ran into this problem so \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\". Bringing the CRM vendor on-site to do a re-install would be expensive and they'd like to avoid it. This customer does not have internet access for their network so remote vpn isn't an option there. Someone has to fly in.\n So, is there any way to get server 2019 installed on this box w/o a format, e.g.\n a) can I somehow change the product key on the existing Windows Storage Server 2016 install to a Windows Server Standard 2016 product key and then do the \"upgrade\" (I did try this but it says my windows server 2016 product key is invalid, which I know it isn't, since its in use on a real 2016 server at the moment (e.g. \"downgrade\" the server), or\n b) can I somehow 'trick' the installation process to ignore the version?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/DisposableAccount712  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For decades, I have used Windows Task Scheduler to run small processing jobs nightly. Currently, these are Server 2019 systems in question. Sometime in the last month, some of the jobs which rely heavily on the \"run as user\" context to gain access to specific resources started failing. When taking a closer look at these failing jobs, it appears that they are no longer \"running as\" the user which they are assigned. They are failing in different ways, too -- for instance, one job uses SQL Server Integrated security to login and retrieve data from a SQL Server, others move files around to different servers and need to have specific access to access these shares. It's all failing now.\n These aren't new jobs, they're ones which have been running successfully daily for years. I've done all the obvious things like tried to re-create the jobs with no avail. The jobs run fine if I run them manually under the context of the users they're expected to run as, like starting powershell as the user, or logging into the system as the user. They just no longer run through Task Scheduler.\n My environment IS a subset of a larger Active Directory with AD Admins for the environment that do have management abilities like applying group policies and the such. When asking these admins if they've applied any security settings over the last month, I've been met with a lot of shrugs and \"I don't think anything has changed\". Of course, I can see the applied policies but have no idea which, if any, have been added or modified in the last 30 days or so.\n So, I'm reaching out here and asking if perhaps any of you folks might have an inkling on what could be going on, or if there might be a GPO setting you can think of that could have been turned on or modified that my effect the Task Scheduler in this way. I would be open to any thoughts to suggestions, as I feel like the ability to run a job as another user is a key feature in Task Scheduler and without it, it's relatively useless.\n    submitted by    /u/MakisupaVT  \n [link]   [comments]",

This particular colleague is a “senior”. \n Anyway this particular colleague is asking me for help with their tasks multiple times a day. I have tried my best to help them where I can without giving them direct instructions or answers, for example providing documentation or asking them questions to guide them to the answers in the hope that they will learn better that way. \n However just lately I have felt drained by this, they continue to push and push till I’m basically at a point where I have to give them the answer else i won’t get any of my own work done.\n This week for example, they have taken a simple task in AWS which would take about 2/3 hour if you want to automate it with terraform (I don’t want to give too many specifics in case they are lurking). This job has now been going on for over a week still not completed it with almost daily questions about very basic things or asking to fix errors they are getting. To be clear this person has been working with terraform for almost 2 years at this point and was employed as a senior cloud engineer so it’s not like this person has just been dropped into something they shouldn’t or don’t understand.\n How is the best way of approaching this situation, I would like to get my time back and stop supporting this colleague so much. However, at the same time I don’t want to be considered unreasonable by refusing to help?\n Maybe I made this situation worse by helping in the first place I don’t know.

We recently bought two (2) new workstations and noticed that neither of them were getting any signal from the ethernet/switch (computer said no ethernet cable connected). I troubleshooted it for a while and noticed that every time I disabled the ethernet adapter, the lights on the ethernet port starting to show some data. To me, this seem like a driver or Windows issue so I updated the drivers using the latest one from the MB's website with no success. I also clean installed Windows and no success.\n One thing I did notice is that they would get internet if the connection was bridged. For example, our VoIP phones have a PC port. When bringing a cable from the VoIP port, the computer would get internet. I also tried with a 5 port switch and it actually worked too. It seems that the issue is when connected directly to the wall.\n When I noticed that everything worked when not plugged directly to the wall, I started to mess around the connection on the switch and no matter what I did the issue was always there. What seems strange to me is that no other workstation that are already there present similar issue. I even connected the computer to one port that was already working for someone else and the PC will not recognize the ethernet cable.\n I grab the computers and brought them to a different floor and they work fine when connected directly to the wall. This makes me think that it could be a switch related issue. This is the first time I come across something like this in my work experience. I have called a couple of friends who were also clueless on what could be the issue.\n Any advise will be greatly appreciated!!\n    submitted by    /u/monedadeoro  \n [link]   [comments]",

This demand for RHEL code is disingenuous. \n  \nI mean, fair enough. We 'bought in' to the RHEL ecosystem, running Centos in prod, and now were moving to Alma. We had a few RHEL support contracts for \"key\" servers, but mostly stuck with the open source options, and found that having an easy 'move-to-prod' road was of some value. \n Shooting down Alma, Rocky, Oracle Linux and Centos all at once though? Well, I guess that's a pretty solid 'F you' and we'll now have to review our options. I guess this might drive some license fees out of us, but it might as easily push us to 'never RedHat'.

I used to love configuring network devices with the CLI, planning out networks, I eventually want to get into cybersecurity. I normally love problem solving and I used to be thrilled to learn about technologies. Now I just hate it. I hate working with 365, project planning/managing, doing file migrations, email, cutovers, working with software vendors, and working with our customers. I'm starting to resent my coworkers and company as whole. I'm not sure how to remedy the situation because this was my only career choice. This is my 3rd IT job and I don't remember hating my old ones like this. The work was similar, albeit less moving parts. I'm not sure if IT is not the career for me, or if my current job is just killing the passion. I have my N+, A+, and I'm working toward Sec+. I am so disinteresed/frustrated with work I don't have the motivation to read my CompTIA books anymore, but the thought of abandoning something I used to be so passionate about breaks my heart. Any advice is appreciated, thanks.\n EDIT: this got way more responses than i anticipated! i dont have time today to reapond to everyone, but i have lots to consider now.

I have a VMware ESXi server, and to simplify things let's say it currently has 10 VMs, each VM having a management NIC, and a customer VLAN NIC. Currently I can use a service like NRPE to execute commands on each VM, and NRPE runs a networking command (like a cURL, ping, or similar) over the customer network NIC. The NRPE agent listens on the management NIC, but executes the commands over the customer VLAN NIC.\n Customer wise, for simplicity we'll say customers are called Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, and so on. Their VLANs correspond like 10, 20, 30, and so on. Each customer network has an identical IP space of 10.0.0.0/8, and the IP of this VM will be identical in each of the networks.\n I'm building a new VM which has a single management NIC, and a single trunk NIC (VLAN 4095 in VMware parlance). I've tested configuring the secondary NIC on the VM as Customer1 with VLAN 10 tagged, and that works fine (so the port is all good), but I'm having trouble with network namespaces. My end goal is to be able to run commands like ip netns exec customer1 ping 8.8.8.8 and get the results (quick crap example, but you get the idea).\n I tried to borrow the principles from [this article] but it wouldn't work for me. \n Is what I'm trying to do possible?\n    submitted by    /u/iDemonix  \n [link]   [comments]",

No matter how many minutes i select in GPO and apply it I always see the same result. If the Windows are not locked then it works like expected.\n Only if I set the display to never turn off (so 0 in GPO) and never on energy settings in Windows does the monitor stay awake - but this is not something that we want. After you are not around for 15-20 minutes there is no reason to keep the monitors turned on.\n Hybrid sleep is off. The monitor settings have been checked multiple times, there is no any power saving mode active. The same thing happens if the laptop is on its own, the display will turn off in a matter of seconds. I did not check the bios settings, but this should not cause the problem?\n ​\n Cheers!\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Master_Kidfisto  \n [link]   [comments]",

From looking, the only native option for file share in Azure is Azure Files, and it doesn’t support NTFS permissions, plus only works with storage account keys. You can only truly use Kerberos and ACL permissions if your identities are hybrid, (the devices can still be AAD joined in this case) \n Given the fact that, if we were to have our identities hybrid, we’d be able to receive Kerberos tickets on an AAD joined machine, in result this opens a few doors for us, without even having the need to hybrid join machines. \n The other option would be to dump 10+ TB into sharepoint, however, to me, that makes absolutely no sense as Sharepoint Online is not meant to replace a file system. \n Thoughts? Would it better a better option to ditch the managed domain in AADDS and move to ADDS? Users would be hybrid, devices would still be cloud joined. So it wouldn’t necessarily be completely moving to “on-prem”, plus if we already have and utilize Azure AD domain services, I don’t really see a point in it, being that Azure AD domain services is extremely limited and probably better for a mom & pop shop type of environment.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Hearing3804  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Like many people currently, I just moved a handful of domains away from Google Domains. As expected, all domain transfers added one year to the expiration, except one.\n This one domain was \"auto renewed\" at Google domains just over a week before being transferred. The transfer did not add a year to the expiration. I asked the new registrar what happened and they said the domain was in the auto-renewal grace period, which occurs after a domain has expired. I thought there's no way, Google auto renewed the domain, how could it have expired?\n So I started looking at my Google domain transactions. If the transaction dates are anything to go by, the domain was originally purchased at X time. The \"auto renew\" transaction happened one year later on the same date, but at X + just under two hours. So it appears Google domains let this domain expire for almost two hours before the \"auto renew\" took place. This put the domain into the grace period which means when I transferred it, no additional year was added.\n Again, this is what appears to have happened. Going off of transaction times and the fact that the transfer didn't add a year to the expiration. Google domains says the auto renew feature is supposed to renew a domain within a month before expiration. It seems like they didn't and cost me a year's worth of registration. Not a lot of money, but what bothers me more is thinking my domain may not have been working, which I use mainly for email, for almost two hours before the auto renew happened. And I probably wouldn't have noticed if I didn't transfer it.\n If anyone from Google domains is here, you owe me $12.\n    submitted by    /u/brsh2  \n [link]   [comments]",

The configuration profile marks as successful, but in the security admin center under device inventory I don't currently see any devices listed in there. I have created some AV policies but AFAIK they are not working (for example I tried to disable the user from being able to open defender settings, and currently I can still override my AV settings just by going through the Windows Defender security settings).\n I downloaded and ran some well known malware (mimikatz) and was able to launch and run commands in mimikatz. About 5 mins of the computer sitting idle, I heard a few notifications come in saying \"Enterprise unwanted application found\" and indicates it deleted the threats. \n I'm fairly confused, clearly that doesn't seem right. I re-enrolled the device a second time using the local script .cmd approach however I still don't see any devices listed in the M365 Defender/security admin portal. There is no indicator on the client that DFE MDE has been installed (does it need to be \"installed\" per se or just enrolled?)\n Obviously being able to launch and run commands in mimikatz was only possible because I disabled the real time protection and clicked past many warnings, but still something doesn't seem right there. Is DFE MDE just a centralized location for admins to manipulate built in Windows Defender settings?

I probably cannot just ask them, as the company is old-school and they'd prefer me just sitting idlely for an hour even though I have nothing to do.\n Our setup is as follows, Azure Active Directory, every machine is a Windows, all connected on the same internal network that you have to 2FA into your machine. All of the network is monitored and goes through a proxy. We also have laptop window machines that work on the same active directory account and if you want to access your work station inside the office from home, you have to use their VPN and then Remote Desktop into it. This all works great, and while I am not a Windows user myself, I am really pleased as to how nice the experience is, considering the heavy emphasis on safety.\n Now to my question, to what extent can my employer track me? My main questions are about the laptop, when it's not connected to their network/ VPN, is there anything inside the laptop/ windows that is tracking what I am doing? Do I have to cover my camera? I am mostly asking because after finishing my work for the day and I am at the office, I usually have an hour or so to kill before I can go home, and I would like to Remote Desktop/ SSH into my home machine and continue working on my own stuff, but I am not sure if these can be tracked and if I would alert someone like I am doing something shady. \n Basically I would like to access my own machine from the work laptop without causing problems for anyone. \n    submitted by    /u/West-Papaya  \n [link]   [comments]",

That's why my resources are limited.\n I wanted to buy Intel nuc 13 pro with i7-1360P processor + 64GB ram. When I compare the specs, this computer has really great specs even compared to older large rack servers. But this computer defaults to home use and not as a server.\n Does it make sense to buy this computer as a 24/7 server to host my online store? In fact, it will be just one Ubuntu system or virtualization with two systems. The website will be made mainly in PHP + mysql. My main concerns are the inability to use ecc memory and the processor, although its parameters are impressive 12-cores 16-threads maybe it's not a processor that can handle the load generated by hundreds of users on a website so well?\n Unfortunately I don't have room for a bigger server at home - rack servers are very noisy and smaller ones like the proliant micorserver are still quite big.

WMI for Windows, SNMP for Linux/appliances, and so on. but, it feels very, very stuck in the past. like, it's 2023 and they still do not support recurring maintenance window scheduling, or rules like \"only alert if the alarm threshold has been exceeded for X scan intervals\". maddening.\n the handful of other products i've tried -- PDQdeploy, ManageEngine Patch Manager, Automox, Level dot io -- do not (at the time i tested each one) support pre- or post-patch scripting, e.g., stop the specified service and wait for the process to terminate before beginning patching. naturally, i'm tired of doing it manually in BatchPatch but i just haven't found a solid replacement yet.\n i have about 140 Windows servers (98% VM's) that i need to deal with.\n please give me recommendations on products and/or process improvements that you've found to make this task easier. thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/No_Direction4544  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have zero recollection of that and told him we are on Teams with an EA and local telco for Direct Routing so we're not interested and hung up. \n The fact that a somewhat reputable company is spoofing numbers looks really bad if not illegal. I wouldn't consider them for my business now because of this. I'm in Canada so really not sure what the rules are. I hate sales people. I don't understand how this could be allowed. \n    submitted by    /u/Golden_Dog_Dad  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now each one of us save their documents in their own computer, so when someone needs a document other person has it has to be sent by mail (I know, it's a disaster). We have a limited budget. I was reading that the best option could be a NAS server with RAID. The brand I mostly hear is Synology. We use W7, W10 and MacOs. Wich server do you recommend me for our needs? We need to have remote access in case we are not in the office btw.\n Thanks in advance for any advice :)\n Edit:\n Thank you all for your advices. Many has suggested using cloud. However I had a bad experience with OneDrive (lost information). For me there are three advantages of not using cloud. 1 You only pay once/not monthly payment (as far as I know, so in long term is cheaper) 2 can use your files even if there's not internet 3 easier to make backups.\n However I will be open minded\n    submitted by    /u/Malacho_21  \n [link]   [comments]",

I set up a new Virtual Disk, configured the RAID array, did a fast initialization (as the drives were brand new), everything went smoothly.\n However, on reboot, it took a very long time for the server to start, and it stops at the PERC initialization with the message \"Adapter at Baseport is not responding. No adapter\" and fails to continue to boot.\n Removing the drives, the adapter is initialized and the machine boots.\n I also tried adding the drives while I was in the BIOS RAID utility, and it's the same, as via IDRAC. The drives get recognized, RAID array configuration works, but upon reboot, it stops with the same error message.\n Before the error message pops up, the drives' LEDs blink slowly, sequentially (one after the other). After a few minutes, they all blink fast. I let it be for a few hours, but did not change the results.\n Here are some other things I tried already:\n  \nfirmware/bios update - everything is up to date\n only connected 1/2/4/6 drives at a time\n removed other drives in the enclosure\n perform a full initialization of the raid array from the BIOS RAID utility\n opened up the server and checked the cables, battery, reseated the adapter\n used another identical server\n  \nAny idea of what might be wrong?\n Anyone else use this combo R720/H710P/1643a?\n Thanks a bunch!\n    submitted by    /u/Ditzah  \n [link]   [comments]",

Because it was a huge pain and I found no resources online, plus Lenovo’s premium tech support couldn’t help over the phone.\n Long story short: Borked Windows install on tower and wanted to run an official recovery install rather than a clean one. Recovery Creator was failing to create the installer USB drive.\n Steps initially taken:\n  \n Placed online digital order for recovery\n  Inserted a flash drive\n  Downloaded Lenovo USB Recovery Creator and ran it\n  Signed in and selected my digital order\n  Let it download the media\n  Allowed it to attempt to create the USB recovery key\n  \nAt this point it failed, with a number of errors mentioning that it could no longer find the flash drive and that it failed at partitioning the drive.\n Checked disk management and found it had created a RAW 32GB partition and left the rest of the space unallocated. Looked like it failed after that initial partitioning, right before formatting.\n What it took to get it to work:\n Disk management failed every time I tried to manually repartition or in any way ‘fix’ the USB drive.\n I had to use diskpart, select the disk, clean it, create partition primary. After this I was able to successfully modify the drive through disk management again.\n Some more testing and I discovered you basically have to manually create the 32GB FAT32 partition on a flash drive and most importantly, assign it a letter. Make sure to leave the rest of the drive space unallocated. Then use the recovery creator to actually write the media and create the recovery USB.\n Don’t manually create and format the partition? The recovery creator will try to do it itself and fail. Messing up your flash drive and requiring diskpart to fix.\n Don’t assign a drive letter after partitioning and formatting? Recovery creator will simply fail.\n Best of luck to anyone who may come across this in their time of need.\n    submitted by    /u/DanielThiberge  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, I’m not really a system administrator but need some advice regarding a potential solution that could work for an office with about 5 network drives. Each of these drives is chock full of data with a very well maintained and organized folder structure/hierarchy.\n Unfortunately, data is organized by project number (and not labeled in any way that’s clear), so it makes it difficult for people to get acquainted and find files for the projects they’re working on. Additionally, since there are so many nested directories, it can take clicking through multiple levels before realizing whether you’re in the right directory to start with.\n Is there a good, ready/easy to deploy system that can create a clean searchable directory of directories and file paths? I’m imaging something where the project number or project name could be entered, and then all various paths relating to the project could show up with labels to make it clear (i.e., Floor Plans: P:/00-1020202-22/Ar/FP/, Mechanical: P:/General Resources/MechanicalCAD/).\n Thanks in advance for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/FyrePixel  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Help Desk has pushed this issue up to the Sys Admins saying it's a server side issue.\n The user has a basic Outlook rule they enable when they go to lunch/are out of office to forward any emails sent to them to their coworker. They enable/disable this rule when they don't need the forwarding. However, when they try to disable this rule - it will continually re-enable itself. \n Things we've tried:\n - Delete and recreate rule\n - Ran Office Repair\n - Deleted Mail Profile and recreated it\n - Ran Clean Rules Wizard\n - Delete SRS File\n We've confirmed other clients are not having issue. When attempting to turn off the rule in OWA, it appears to be disabling it in the local client correctly however. The opposite doesn't work. We're a hybrid O365 environment. I'm not understanding how this works - does anyone have any information on what would cause this or some things to try? At wit's end \n    submitted by    /u/GringeITGuy  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can't fleece or finesse your way getting local, high-skilled techs to do your work for you, run your business, onboard clients and expect to streamline your work in a matter of a few years, while sitting back drinking, snorting powder, or whatever pipe dreams you have. It may work for a little while, but you will eventually end up with employees, and clients alike, who will devalue your business to its demise. \n Where I'm from there's a toxic culture of this at the moment. Just because you started your IT career in 08 doesn't quantify your business for 15 years in service with a solid client base, when you decided to break off in 2018 and \"be your own boss\".\n Now, this is mainly for prospective employees looking to get into the MSP realm, fresh out of college, first IT jobs. Be very, very careful when applying and accepting positions for MSP's. Do your research, look up the directors and consultants and their history. If you don't, you will burn your resume with short stints at these failed businesses, who fight over breadcrumb clients with their empty promises of a seamless silver service. \n Always ratio the business in terms of current techs to managed clients before accepting a position - at the moment a safe zone and job security is 1:50, and may even move more towards 1:75 1:100 as more businesses go cloud. Anything less and you are only going to fill a void for 6-12 months and end up in the endless cycle of last in first out, as business goes through peaks and troughs at certain times of the year. \n This is not speculation, it's a reality.\n    submitted by    /u/EvolvedChimp_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey there! Just wanted to share a bit about my background. I joined my company as a network engineer about 3 months ago, bringing along my CCNP certification and previous experience in Cisco networking. Although I have some familiarity with basic Linux commands, my main expertise lies in the networking side of IT.\n Now, here's where things get interesting. The senior system administrator recently left the company, leaving me in charge of managing all the systems and servers. To be honest, I feel a bit overwhelmed and lacking in confidence. The senior guy still tries to help me out when he can, but he's got his own projects keeping him busy.\n The senior IT guy at our company has over 20 years of experience, and he's incredibly knowledgeable. He seems to have a natural understanding of all aspects of systems and developments. Technical stuff comes easily to him, so he never really felt the need to document everything. Before he left, he did his best to teach me, but I must admit it wasn't enough for me. I'm not placing any blame on him, though. In fact, I really liked working with him and learned a lot. I'm simply sharing my current situation and the challenges I'm facing in my role.\n Let me give you an idea of what I'm dealing with. I've got my hands full with various VMs, including a Perforce server, TrueNAS, Active Directory, PFSense firewall, NextCloud, and several customer server VMs. The thing is, I'm fairly new to VMware systems, Linux, NAS, and PFSense. It doesn't seem like the company is planning to hire a senior IT person anytime soon, so it looks like I'll be flying solo in the IT department for a while.\n I know I need to upskill and expand my knowledge, but any advice or tips you have for someone in my shoes would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/kus222  \n [link]   [comments]",

My questions is what are the fundentmental differences between DEX tools like Lakeside and RMM tools like NinjaOne? \n From what I can tell, they appear to be very similar. DEX is geared more towards letting the end user fix issues while RMM is more for full remote system management. THey each seem to overlap on some things.

Here, I am the end user who knows enough to be dangerous.\n I have a beloved 4port DVI KVM that has served me for 15y+ and has outlived its own, and a replacement generic power supply. The manufacturer gives the spec as \"DC5.3V:5.91W:53BTU\". This means little to me beyond VxA=W, therefore 1.11509433962 Amp. I don't have a clue what BTU means, I assume it's some sort of pre IEEE British Tickling Unit standard for calculating time/distance/nautical speed/psychological moustache impact.\n So armed with this basic knowledge, I conclude I need a 5.3 Volt 1.11509433962 Amp DC power supply of +1 good luck finding that on ebay roll a D6 for No.\n However, the long serving recently deceased 5v generic PSU would suggest there are ranges and tolerances to device power distribution. As did a confusing and in hindsight extremely troubling conversation with my teenage era physics teacher which concluded with \"meh, over/undervolt by up to 50% you don't have to get all precious about it\". \n \"Sir..\", as I was institutionally minded to refer to him as a child of the mid 80s to 90s English school system, \"make sense, my autism begs you. It's either 5.3 Volt 1.11509433962 Amp on your own GCSE final exam paper, or it's chaos. Please which is it?\"\n So my questions is:\n Given that USB is 5v, and fast charging phone PSUs are not limited to the 500mA standard, and I have worked in IT for over two decades and have never thrown anything away, is there a chance I can MacGyver a solution right now in my home after an entire bottle of wine, or at least for less than a fiver on ebay searching for \"USB to DC multi connector cable\" ?\n ​\n Thank you all in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Echolalalalalalalia  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our SAN is starting to run out of space and we don't have the money to replace the whole thing at the moment (I can't add nodes because StoreVirtual is discontinued). I am looking for ways to free up some space on the SAN and the prime candidate would be to move our primary file server as it is using 2.75TB of space. The two VMware 5.5 host servers have 5 TB of local RAID as this was originally used for VM storage before we got the SAN. So, I am trying to figure out how to create a HA file server using this empty space. My first idea was to just setup two new VMs and cluster them but that requires shared storage which I don't have. Then I looked at Storage Spaces Direct but that requires some high-end network infrastructure that I don't have. I have looked at trying to setup some sort of mirrored storage in VM directly but I don't see any way to do that. Nor can I add disks from two different hosts to the same VM to do OS based mirroring. My last option is to use DFS Replication but I'm not sure how to do this without shared storage. I would also need to do a standalone namespace because of all the things that point to the existing UNC. Does anyone know if I can do DFS replication across a Windows Cluster or are there any better solutions?\n    submitted by    /u/CaynadianToo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some were funny and others were serious. I appreciate it them all!\n I really thought about a few of the comments like: \n \"Work slower, focus on quality and stop overwhelming yourself.\"\n \"6 months from now no one will care that you’re over working yourself.\"\n \" Fuck it, became a goat farmer, follow your dream my guy.\"\n It is my fault really for the stress and anxiety. Maybe because I am a bit proud? I think I can do it all!?\n I sat with myself and told myself, I am not a machine. I am a human. I need to have limits for my own sanity. Limits are good. It's ok. Do your best you can. Anything else is either for tomorrow or the company needs more folks. Stop doing the work of 2 and just do you. I feel much better today. Feels like a lot of weight off of my shoulders. Today I came into work, and I told myself out loud: \n 'Do you best. Focus on the quality. If the customer gets angry, let them talk with my manager, and then I'll have that conversation with my manager after. Don't get worked up and stressed. Do a good job and then go home.' Last Friday was bad for me in a very long time. I almost cried because I felt I had nowhere else to go, didn't know who I was, just miserable and lost. Thought I'd never get to this point but there I was. It's good to check in with yourself and realize we work to live and not the other way around. \n ​\n Anyways, enough of this.

I've recently come on-board in the last 6 months have found that 40% of the systems in our fleet will not meet Windows 11 requirements when it goes out of support in October 2025.\n My biggest issue is I don't believe I have the people-resources or funding to replace all of the systems by that date.

I do not have any experience with other SAML providers and therefore do not know if they have similar cert renewal mechanisms and how other relaying partys work with that, but I am guessing that a well-programmed relaying party usually should be able to check for both (the primary and secondary) certificates so that there is a grace period for switching?

I've tried every single things, including Microsoft help pages, forums and more but nothing works : I can't manage to get a layout file for the start menu.\n So has anyone ever worked on this subject and can help me with that? \n Thanks for reading and have a nice day!\n (sorry if there's any mistakes)\n    submitted by    /u/Lixey_  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Auth Proxy's validation checker says my setup is good to go.\n I found old posts about Fortigate firewalls not playing nice with Auth Proxies on different network segments. I saw that setting a source ip in the Fortigate firewall might help. No dice. Still fails to connect to my Duo Authentication Proxy's radius server. My IP addresses and secret key are definitely correct. \n I'm wondering if port 1812 is being blocked by my Fortigate firewall. Per nmap, port 1812 is \"filtered\" on my server running my Duo Auth Proxy. When I test disabling my Windows Server Firewall and scan again, I'm told port 1812 is closed. I see no obvious firewall rules allowing/blocking port 1812. Would I be correct in deducing that my Fortigate firewall is therefore likely blocking port 1812 on my network?\n    submitted by    /u/challengeriii  \n [link]   [comments]",

So it should provide redundancy and remove the need to replicate domain controllers\n Use Azure File Sync for our main file server.

They’ve left a huge mess and installed Sql, python, ODBC, and basically a bunch of crap, with no GPOs, no locked down services or drive re-direction blocked, it’s basically a giant disaster. In addition, they set the VM session count limit to 20, with 32 gig ram and 8 cpu per VM. \n Firstly, I think the specs are way overkill, would you agree here? \n Second, the amount of bloat software on these VMs seems a bit ridiculous to me. A design to have non-persistent VDIs, regardless if they are RDSH or win10, should really not even have SQL, python, ODBC, and all this junk on there, that is designed physical endpoints or persistent VDIs. \n Thirdly, I spun up a few hardened VDIs with a baseline image, 2 CPU, 8 gig ram. Someone decided to upgrade all of my persistent VDIs to 4 cpu & 16 gig ram, because “users were complaining”, because they are Power Users that use SQL, PBI, etc. \n while azure monitor clearly shows a lack of resources even being used. \n Am I going crazy here?

          "description": "Hi guys. I’m a new sys admin at company that just got rid of their senior sys admin a month before I joined up. We’ve got 4 rack servers all operating as hypervisors and a storage server(Synology NAS with a bunch of HDDs). 4 LUNs were created on top of these drives and each LUN was mapped via iSCI to each hypervisor, all the VMs boot and run from these LUNs. Also got a Microtik cloud router switch that connects all the Hypervisors to the storage server(1Gbps connections). \n My question: is this an optimal set up, having multiple VMs on each host sitting on LUNs? Is it best practice? If not how may I possibly improve it? I’m willing to rebuild everything from the ground up if I have to. Any suggestions would be appreciated! And yes I definitely plan to reach out to experienced sys admins to help with doing the actual set up but figured I’d also see what y’all think about this. \n P.S During a recent power issue on one of the hosts I realized that all the VMs lost connection to the storage server and for some reason the iSCI connection kept hanging without reconnecting.. this wouldn’t even be an issue if I was running the VMs locally (buts that’s just my reasoning anyway)\n    submitted by    /u/-zazu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Posted this r/intune but figured I'd put it here as well in case anyone can offer some insight: \n I have a hybrid environment with a fair few devices. I put 30 Windows 10 devices in an Update Ring for W11 but only 11 of them seemed to upgrade. All the devices were on and syncing with Intune.\n I had the Active time set as 08:00 to 18:00 so updates should automatically occur outside of those hours, right?\n I even had \"Restart Checks\" set as \"Skip\" since these are desktops (No worries about battery) and some of my users only \"Lock\" their PC and do not actually Sign Out. I wasn't sure if this would be detected as \"User Presence\" or not.\n The next day, I actually manually dialled into some of the PCs and did \"Check for Updates\" and the W11 update was there (Along with the Cumulative one for some but not all) and started installing and I was prompted to restart to finish the installation.\n The pie chart on the overview page isn't much help. It only shows there were errors with 4 of the PCs but upon clicking it, it shows each of the four devices on there twice, once as \"System Account\" once as the UPN of a user (I suspect the last ones to log in on the device). For the record, none of the devices have a primary user set on Intune. It even says \"Succeeded\" for each of the devices even though they were still on Windows 10.\n Any idea what I'm doing wrong here?\n Also, is the actual \"Downloading\" of the update happening outside of the active hours as well? In an ideal world, I'd want the update to Download/Install (Same as when you do \"Check for Updates\") during active hours while the user is logged in (To save on time), I'd just want the force restart to happen outside of Active Hours or if the user chose to do \"Update and Restart\" or \"Update and Shutdown\". Not too fussed about this however for now since I'm only deploying this to 9-5 users but will eventually have to deploy it to PCs that are used 24/7 with only random 1-2 hour breaks in between use.\n    submitted by    /u/RealAgent0  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need something that can scale, reprovisioned quickly, and has direct hardware access (GPU abd PCI devices).\n My laptop has pretty good specs (16 cores, 32Gb memory, and 2 TB storage one M.2 SSD and one SATA SSD).\n I want the 2 systems to share one partition as a data partition. For example i can store virtualbox VMs on that partition and be able to use these VMs on both windows and linux.\n I am currently reinstalling both systems to clean them up because I was installing alot of programs and stuff to learn and it is now too much to be cleaned, I also neee to repartition the drives with different sizes, but its not fun at all, takes alot of time and effort.\n SO, I was thinking that I can use my laptop as a virtualization server (with proxmox for example) and install both my systems as VMs and have all the advantages that proxmox offers with managing these VMs and their resources). But I am not sure how user friendly will this be for me, and what are the limitations of such architecture? \n I appreciate any suggestions or if you have other good ideas for my setup, this might become a thing in the future :)\n    submitted by    /u/DynamicResolution  \n [link]   [comments]",

But doesn't retain any local printer settings.\n Has anyone got a solution for easyprint? Or does anyone know of a way we can carry over the local print settings when using the matching driver?\n We have looked at importing the printer registry keys on the rds so it retains settings but heard this can be a nightmare and not reliable.\n    submitted by    /u/LastStandD  \n [link]   [comments]",

There has been absolutely zero policy or procedure for the past 20 years, and as a result everything is a mess. There is no coordination and the sysadmins spend their time fighting with each other about priorities. Systems are all inconsistently configured. it's a mess. But they're paying me quite well and I'm up for a challenge.\n However reading on here, and dealing with these guys at the new company, it's amazing how just absolutely resentful people are about structure, policy and procedure. \n Most of the guys I work with think there needs to be policy and procedure, but each of them think their version is what everyone else should follow.\n I'm developing standards, and giving them opportunities for input, but they'r fighting me the whole way. A lot of it is stuff people here probably would think is reasonable: building machines from standard templates, using a password database, scripting out common tasks.\n I'm going to get what I need one way or another even if it means a lot of these people have to find other jobs, but it truly is fascinating watching people fighting common sense, hard.\n The usual \"this will make your life better\" and \"we will create a more stable environment so you guys are not on call so much\" doesn't seem to help with this crowd. It is definitely an interesting situation.\n I'm doing my best to lead people down the right path, but eventually I'm going to have to switch to an authoritarian leader who gives orders if all else fails here.\n    submitted by    /u/crankysysadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I work at the help desk in a small office environment. My senior that does all the actual complicated admin work operates remotely and is notoriously difficult to contact. As a result, much of the work is done by me when it really shouldn’t be. I’m in school, but lack a lot of formal training. I’m more or less just the “guy that knows computers”.\n A user reported to me that their HP printer did not work. This is a printer that only this one user uses, and has never had any issues before. I try to print and the computer says there isn’t even a printer connected, so I look and it’s not showing on the network. I add it directly by ip, but jobs still won’t leave the queue. So I check the printer itself and it can print a test page just fine when I do it from the printer. I figure it’s a driver issue, so I get the newest drivers from HP’s site and it finally works!\n The problem comes when I report to my senior that I solved the issue and how I did it. This kind of thing usually does not get a reply from him. However this time he called me on the phone, which is SUPER out of character. He sounds super angry. He tells me that “printer drivers haven’t changed in 40 years.” And that we just needed to “direct the traffic properly next time.” He goes on to explain to me that this was a “big no no” and that future printer concerns should be directed to him.\n Where did I go wrong here? Like I said I’m not formerly trained, but I’ve never once heard anyone ever say that there was an issue with just getting drivers from the official source for a printer. I also did not really understand what he meant by directing the traffic.\n    submitted by    /u/AdditionalPossible99  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically, the server finds the windows bootloader, and it errors out the windows installation before I can do anything with the server. It then reboots when I click OK and goes to the same error again.\n \n HP Support then sends me a tool where I have work work with a CAB file that the tool makes. OK great, boot into windows, use their tool and send them the file they need for analysis... \n Except I can't boot into Windows!!!\n Working with level 2 they want me to download the recovery media...

Our policy for BYOD doesnt address this, so we might want to get that changed.\n In my opinion, if the user wants their work email on their phone, and willing to download and install the profile, it's secure, and therefore good in my books - who's phone is or is not being paid for is not mine to manage.\n I thought I would reach out to the hive mind and see if that aligns with others as well.\n ​\n edit: haha, BYOB.

We use MS Office 2021 Standard and Exchange Server 2019.\n I have made PS script which replaces data in .HTM template and puts it in Signature folder for each user in GPO. Then it calls Outlook.exe to apply signature for user.\n The problem is - my signature is made in MS Word as table with text and images. Images are hosted at imgbb and placed in HTM code. When i open Outlook and apply signature it says that it cannot load images from the source.\n My suggestion is that Outlook is blocking external links with some security policies or it cant handle images as links when applying signature to Outlook.\n My questions are:\n 1) What can i do to make images work without creating other files/folders rather than .HTM file? I have tried manually replace images in code with base64 encoding but it didnt help. Maybe i can generate HTM signature template with some external services.\n 2) Is there any other way to generate signature for Outlook users?

This is working well. \n Shortly after configuring all of this I started getting fairly regular emails regarding the UPS switching to battery due to both erratic power, and low voltage. I've been investigating possible reasons for this including contacting the power company. A couple weeks ago I found out that a tenant in our building (warehouse units) has a welder that they use occasionally. I went down and talked to them, explained what I was seeing and they agreed to let me know the next time they were going to use the welder!\n Today, they called me and let me know they would be using it in the next few minutes, and indeed the notices started rolling in! So this really does seem to be the cause of the issues that I'm seeing.\n My perception is that if this is happening regularly, then something needs to be adjusted and fixed otherwise I can expect less life out of my UPS. That said, I'm not an electrician and I have no idea what could possibly be changed or adjusted to try to fix this. I know at least that the panel my UPS is on is separate from the panel the welder is hooked up to. But I would guess that they are both hooked to the same service connections back in a common point in our building. I feel like the guys with the welder are willing to help figure this out, I'm not worried about who pays for what at this stage or getting them to pay it.

But the crazy part is the end users are reporting ZERO MFA requests on their end. They get them when they actually request them. I work for an MSP and its a number wide number of clients of ours that are being affected. Luckily its not more than like one or two per client for the clients affected. \n I know end users aren't getting notifications as I got a user to help me out. He has a One Plus phone and they have a nifty notifications history feature. He let me comb through his notifications (Luckily it was a device he purchased exclusively for work so there wasn't any personal stuff) and sure enough not a single notification of an MFA request outside of ones he requested which I verified through the sign in logs in Azure. When you look at the logs I see CRAZY sign ins. Like one from Germany and the log says: \n Authentication requirement: Multifactor authentication\n Status: Success \n I'm really confused on how this is possible tbh. Initially my first instinct was a SIM hijack but that wouldn't affect the authenticator. Just to cross it out we've been having affected users call their carriers and nothing out of the ordinary. Then session hijacking comes to mind but the fact its such a broad spectrum of people affected in both locations and companies in general, it was hard to imagine that to be it. And I know that its not just my org. Ive seen a couple of unanswered forums on Microsoft forums and places like spice works.

Our company also uses Azure AD, and I can edit groups. \n For each workload account (there are currently 10 and will be more), we want to have both dev and admin roles per account for users to live in. With this in mind, I thought of 2 options for AD/SSO integration:\n OPTION 1: Creating a user group for every role and account, meaning that there would be a dev and admin user group for every workload account. The drawback to this approach is the higher number of user groups to manage, but we could utilize AWS managed policies. \n OPTION 2: Using AD attributes (ABAC) to create custom permission sets that define a user as dev/admin, so that there only needs to be 1 user group per workload account, and dev/admin roles are determined through ABAC. The drawback to this approach is the initial set up of custom policies, but it results in less AD user groups to manage. \n Which option would you go with, or are there other/better alternatives?\n    submitted by    /u/optimum_hello  \n [link]   [comments]",

My boss got fired on Tuesday, it was amazing how much shit he was doing and how incompitent he was being. Now two weeks into my two month contract I am being pushed for full time and I'm very happy.\n This is a small organization and now it's me and the Sr Admin, I'm going to have the admin's back and I'll be pulling weight around here now. I worked at numerous places that offered me things like being able to learn but with the exception of one or two I never felt like I did a lot of it. Now I'm going to get the chance to learn a lot of things, run systems and more. My background is in Service Desk / Desktop Support style roles so I'm glad to be moving up.

I would like to manage a media server, create an efficient solution for backing up my data and computers, and leave some room for future experimentation.\n At the moment, I have purchased a Synology DS220+ because I was attracted to its ease of configuration and the pre-installed DSM packages. While I noticed several valuable packages like Hyperbackup, Active Backup for Business, and others, I have encountered some issues:\n  \nThe Synology server is not very powerful.\n Some packages are not frequently updated, so I resorted to using Docker.\n Configuring some Docker containers seems to be particularly difficult on DSM.\n  \nTherefore, I am considering setting up a second server where I can install an OS like Unraid or TrueNAS to manage the media server and act as a redundancy for the Synology server. This way, I could use the Synology as a reliable and secure solution while having fun with other containers on the second server. Do you think this choice makes sense? Additionally, I'm thinking of buying an HSGT HC550 18TB HDD for the Synology since I found a great price (€250). On one hand, I would like to take advantage of this opportunity, but on the other hand, I don't want to waste money if I don't have that much data to store.\n I also have two spare 6TB SAS HDDs and a friend's R720 server that I could purchase at a low, symbolic cost.

          "description": "I've run into a bit of an odd issue and would appreciate some input.\n I've got one of my clusters reporting the following error:\n  \nThe computer object associated with the cluster network name resource \"SQL Network Name (---)\" could not be updated in domain \"---\" during the Password change operation. \n The text for the associated error code is: The specified network password is not correct. \n The cluster identity \"CNO$\" may lack permissions required to update the object. Please work with your domain administrator to ensure that the cluster identity can update computer objects in the domain.\n  \nNow, I've only seen this error posted with the \"Access is denied\" code, which usually is resolved by, well, fixing the access permissions that the CNO has on the other resources in order to update them. However, I fail to find anything mentioning my exact error with the incorrect password of the CNO account and a suggested solution for it.\n I've had a look at this with an external party suggesting we still work on the permissions the CNO object has in AD, giving it full control. But I like to avoid just tossing permissions at things hoping it works, especially because this error does not suggest a permission issue.\n I have found the following article, although without my error mentioned, but it makes the most sense (atleast for me) for the issue I'm facing: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/failover-clustering/understanding-the-repair-active-directory-object-recovery-action/ba-p/371891\n This suggests taking the Cluster Name resource offline and using the Repair feature, as this will apparently use the credentials of the currently logged on user to reset the CNO password and replace it.\n I'd like to have a second set of eyes on this, maybe someone has even had this issue before already. I'm not too well versed with Failover Clusters, but the suggestion of the external party doesn't seem proper to me.\n    submitted by    /u/oW_Darkbase  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our print server is running on a 2019 Server Core VM. I can install the Universal Print connector service just fine, but I can't register it with Azure because it wants to open a browser to handle the sign in process.\n On the other hand, the connector service for Azure AD's SSO agent handles this registration process via Powershell. I can't remember which, but I believe I've also encountered one that prompts you to open a MS login page on your workstation and gives you a code to enter. \n I feel like of all the services to run on Server Core, a Print Server is high up there. It seems like laziness that the only reason the Universal Print connector doesn't support Server Core is because it doesn't have a browser to handle logging into Azure to complete the registration process. There's even a Powershell module for managing the connector (such as adding printers to it) after it's been registered! The UP team needs to talk to whichever team worked on the connectors for those other services and copy their registration process.\n Another one that seems lazy to me for similar reasons is the PowerBI data gateway. Once it's registered, I've never seen the need to interact with it again. It SHOULD be able to be run on Server Core but once again, it doesn't because rather than create a registration process via PowerShell they went the lazy way and required a browser based login.\n    submitted by    /u/Matt_NZ  \n [link]   [comments]",

Was there some forced Windows 2019 sever update?

I see various recommendations by searching but nothing definitive. \n  \nDelete the saved state, reduce the memory size (currently 29 GB) and boot up. Delete unnecessary files and expand disk size. Restore memory back to normal or…\n Delete saved state. Copy the VHD to an external HD, boot the machine to that. Delete unnecessary files and move back… expand for a permanent fix. I see two large files, what do I copy? The avhdx file or that and the hard disk image file? \n  \nPlease recommend what is best.

I believe they were accessing sites for recruitment and used their main work email. \n I have some samples of the emails, and I can’t seem to find anything malicious about them. They’re legitimate, just extremely tenacious and annoying. I tried to look for a trend in them, so we could set up some rules to just delete them, but they don’t seem to follow anything scalable and they’re addresses are always different. \n I looked in the exchange online portal, and the anti spam rules all seem like they’re for strictly malicious spam. I might be wrong, but I felt they wouldn’t be helpful. \n I suggested that they just used the OWA to setup their own block/allow lists, but they can’t be bothered and wanted IT to do something about it. I’m kind of at a loss here. Is there anyway to get them out of this hole that I’m missing? Blocking the sending domains could be an option, but not all of them are things we would want to block. Like Glassdoor or legitimate recruitment sites that they and others might use. The worst is when the solicitors send meeting invites, they’re getting placed as tentative on the calendar. I got them out of that one with outlook calendar filters, but am clueless on the emails at this point. \n Any guidance will be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/PrincipleExciting457  \n [link]   [comments]",

Reviewing the messages, it is pretty clear one of the vendors involved in the email process had been compromised. \n The email thread looks normal. The vendor requested and sent an invoice for payment on equipment.\n Two days later there was another follow up urging the payment quickly. The vendor also requested a change in ACH information. You can clearly see the email domain changed at this point and the language has the feel of poor translation. To me there were red flags at this point and had I been involved I would have urged a phone call to confirm the validity of the message.\n Another recipient on the thread from another company involved in this large purchase even doubled down on the payment request. Technically he was fooled too.\n So technically our systems were never compromised. But we are the victim since we made the false payment.\n Whose insurance gets involved here? I assume next step is to report this to the authorities. (local FBI cyber field office)\n Our company has traditionally not taken any of this seriously. I have managed to secure much of the infra a bit at a time with MFA, good AV and better policies. But my scope of oversight has never been able to influence finance and other at risk departments. Policies on ACH payments and convincing key departments to adopt things like password managers has been an uphill battle.\n Anyway, would not mind hearing how others navigated this.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/bender-bender-bender  \n [link]   [comments]",

HR is impotent as they've said they don't want this happening but it continues. the VP above has made promises to 'put a stop to it' yet it continues. \n this is but one in a litany of examples of this toxic and abusive behavior, and an opportunity came up, so i took it. might recruit the rest of my team to come along...

I told them I don't agree with this approach and to get approval from the people signing the checks. \n I would like any opinions regarding the validity of their claims that 100 Sophos licenses are needed to make a Cloudberry backup of a NAS \"safe\" despite having already having Huntress and offering them 1 PC with Sophos to scan the SMB share.\n    submitted by    /u/BadAsianDriver  \n [link]   [comments]",

Cloud is not so simple. * Azure AD itself can't be restored, at least not with the same identities. If you lose control of a tenant, any identities are gone. And if you use Azure AD login and Intune with Bitlocker, your devices are all now wiped as well. Any configuration that depends on application configurations or managed identities needs to be rebuilt. Even UPNs wouldn't work, since you can't add the same domain onto a new tenant. * VMs in Azure can be backed up by any backup agent, but what about PaaS? If you're relying on Azure Backup/ Site Recovery, you just lost that too. Are there any good options for backing up files or blobs in Azure storage accounts? What about databases? Or Azure Key Vault? Azure Automation? * If you're using Azure services, you should be storing all your environment configuration in a code repository. But is it really all there? Have you tested a rebuild? And if you're using a cloud repository and logging in with Azure AD SSO, I have some bad news for you..... * For Office 365 data, much of it can be backed up, but can it be restored in a new tenant? Even tenant-to-tenant migrations with access to both tenants are spotty. In a new tenant, any identities are gone, and any permissions or groups would need to be rebuilt.\n Is there any product out there that claims to be able to restore your entire Azure estate, or should I just throw my hands up and hope it doesn't happen?\n    submitted by    /u/ProMSP  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n The scenario is: You’re upgrading the domain controller to a newer version of Windows Server for some new infrastructure requirements. All workstations are Windows. No Azure AD in place.\n The problem is: Some end users that will need to be migrated to the new domain work remotely (not down the street remotely, but sometimes a few states away remotely). These users connect to resources over VPN, but the VPN authentication is tied to the domain controller that is going to be decommissioned.\n At some point during the migration the authentication of VPN is going to have to be redirected to the new domain controller. What I’m trying to nail down is what’s the best way/best sequence of steps to get all the devices on the new domain with the wrinkle of VPN being tied to the old one?\n There’s only about 15 or so people I’m dealing with, not hundreds or thousands. So even if the process is a little tedious, that’s okay. One thing I thought about is just switching the VPN (temporarily) to authenticate using some other method besides VPN before the migration starts, but I’m trying to see what all my options are.\n TLDR: upgrading/replacing domain controller, some users are offsite so their devices would be joined over VPN, but VPN auth is tied to old domain/domain that is going away. Need to figure out optimal way to do the migration.\n Any thoughts or resources would be appreciated?\n    submitted by    /u/whoyagonnacall_IT  \n [link]   [comments]",

I probably want something automated that let's the service agent the ability to view the file and I guess I can audit this to a log file.. then I also need a DLP solution..\n I would love to hear your thoughts about that and how you think I should work with customers personal documents & store them.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/MadHackerTV  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to figure an issue out and usually my google is on point, but I can't for the life of me figure out where to start with the search. \n We have multiple scan workstations on windows that need fast access to a NAS, producing thousands of folders with images on a daily basis. Current setup is old, not compliant with what we should have. Single user for all pcs that has domain admin and thus way too many rights for what that pc actually needs. But if I use a user without domain admin rights, the folder access speed to the NAS goes down dramatically to the point that a folder containing e.g. 80k subfolders doesn't pull the list fast enough for our software to work, thus crashing the workflow. With domain admin the entire folder is listed in a second or two, without it takes minutes to list.\n I'm at a loss what exactly handles this kind of file access and thus far only found out that domain admin grants the access speed and it's my goal to remove domain admin from that setup.

At that time we announced our end of support for the old one, but our users wouldn't move their apps. They have a ton of reasons, but it mainly comes around priorities and money. Since the original announcement, they've had 2 chances to setup their budget for the year to include the migration but many teams have just not bothered. We've gotten little to no support from our leadership even though we've been hit with a huge, multimillion dollar cost to keep extending support and licensing. They know we're leaving and are stuck, so they can stick us on the way out.\n We've alerted everyone to the fact that we are no longer doing updates to the platform and any security vulnerabilities need to now be tagged against the teams who refuse to leave rather than ours. We've also notified everyone that support goes away at the end of this year, even though we're already so far behind that we aren't supported anyway.\n What else can we do? I'm expecting our leadership to expect a Hail Mary if there is a production impacting outage even though we're ending up so far out of support it'll be a nightmare to fix.

Some said yes, some said no, some just left it.\n None of them can access the server by server name \\\\server2 and of course they only app they use accesses the server by server name.\n Did some testing, they can ping the server IP and it resolves, they can access the shares by IP address. Same thing is happening on the DC in this site. This also happens if they try to access a server by name in site 1. Everything in site 1 is fine by the way.\n Kerberos Event ID 4 is showing up on the server and the workstations. Did the suggested SPN duplicate search but didn't find any duplicates.\n What I did find was if I tried to ping the domain name it would return an IP address other than the server. It is actually just an IP address from the DHCP pool and not actually assigned to anything. This was happening on the server and the desktops.\n I went into DNS and removed that entry. At that point the server in site 2 started working and could access its own shares by name. Workstations could not so I rebooted them with no change. Rebooted server and it still works and so do a handful of the desktops. Some of the desktops still give the error and can't access by name.\n They give the same event id 4 in the event viewer with the name of whatever server we try to access.

Anyhow, these are the agents and apps that launch on every win 10 machine in our environment:\n  \nZscaler\n Rapid 7\n Crowdstrike\n Configuration manager (SCCM)\n Cisco anyconnect (Zscaler does the same Job)\n Lakeside software Systems Management Agent Systrack\n Jabra express (Headphone support software, but only half the company uses jabra headsets nowadays)\n Zoom\n Teams\n Citrix receiver (because why not)\n  \nI'm sure I missed one or 2 but its crazy to me. Does anyone else run these many agents or am I the crazy one for thinking its a bit much?\n    submitted by    /u/DJRob73  \n [link]   [comments]",

In theory, Windows Full Screen Kiosk Mode would be perfect, except for one thing - it doesn't allow to exit a PDF. Unfortunately, there's no way to bypass that. In theory, I could set up a Kiosk without Full Screen, but then I would have to block numerous websites, whereas with Full Screen, I set Intranet as the default page and people can't exit from it. Can you recommend any user-friendly and straightforward Kiosk apps for Windows?\n To be precise, I want the computer to be constantly running in Kiosk mode, and after a few minutes of inactivity, it should clear all data and return to the homepage. I have set the company's website as the homepage, and there is no way to navigate outside of it. You can only browse work-related news, log in to your profile to check your salary or remaining vacation days. And here lies the problem because employee data is generated in PDF format. The Kiosk with Edge easily opens the PDF, but there is no button to return to the previous page. One has to stand by the kiosk and wait for a few minutes until it clears the data and returns to the homepage.\n    submitted by    /u/Frexor93  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here are some practical tips:\n  \nOrganize cables: Proper cable management improves airflow by preventing obstructions. Use cable trays and ties to keep cables tidy. \n \nHot and cold aisle containment: Separate hot and cold airflow paths using physical barriers like curtains or panels. This enhances cooling efficiency and prevents recirculation. \n \nRack placement: Ensure sufficient space between racks to allow for proper airflow. Avoid clustering them too closely.\n \nBlanking panels: Cover empty rack spaces with blanking panels to optimize airflow and prevent recirculation of hot air. \n \nRegular maintenance: Clean or replace air filters, check fan operation, and perform regular maintenance to prevent dust accumulation and ensure proper cooling. \n \nVentilation options: Choose racks with perforated or mesh doors for better airflow. Consider adding fans or ventilation units if necessary. \n \nTemperature monitoring: Use environmental monitoring tools to track temperature and humidity levels. This helps identify areas needing additional cooling or adjustments.\n \n Remember to share your experiences and insights in the comments.

If we don't they will perform audit and eventually law suit which of course the business hotel will have to pay for according to Oracle.\n ​\n My brother is concerned and don't know what to do. They can't identify who did it on the network as people can bring personal computers or log onto the guest wifi.\n ​\n It says on their site \"By downloading, you agree to the terms and conditions of the respective license.\".The extension pack is under the PUEL which states that you are not allowed to use it for commercial use. Can he argue that it has not been used for commercial use as it was downloaded on personal PC's? Do they have a way to see how it's being used.

I built a model that offers unlimited free re-tests\n Scoping: I built an algorithm that automates most of the scoping process so now you can get quotes automatically for most standard projects. No need to wait days for a quote\n Reporting: I've created a system that generates the final reports immediately when the test is done, need to wait 10 working days for a final report..\n Crowd Testing: Some clients want several penetration testers to have a look at their targets but most pen testing companies can't accomedate that. With my setup, I can assign as much as 10 penetration testers to each project\n 24 Start: I've setup our penetration testers and team in a way that allows me to start a penetration test in 24 hours no matter the time of the year.

RDP is properly configured on both devices, and a login preset (Username: \"Win10\\Userguy\", password: \"3xample\") has been set up on Win11 to login on Win10. These credentials work when entered manually.\n Issue:\n When trying to RDP from Win11 into Win10 from a shortcut or selecting Win10 from the dropdown in the RDP interface, the login always fails and a window opens to enter login details. In the window the default user name reads \"Win11\\Userguy\" instead of \"Win10\\Userguy\", which then has to be entered manually again, and the right password. Which work fine. But even when saving these credentials, the next time the issue happens again.\n Edit:\n After doing a manual save of the preset, it now seems to properly save the username (\"Win10\\Userguy\") but the login still fails and I am dumped in the Windows Security dialogue (\"Your credentials did not work\") which asks me to enter the correct credentials. Now the default username reads \"Win10\\Userguy\" but if I just enter the password I am returned to the Windows Security dialogue (\"Your credentials did not work\"), and only after using \"More choices\" and entering the credentials again (username and password) does the login succeed.\n    submitted by    /u/get-derped  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a decent spec machine with 64gb memory and 4 x SAS SSD (with the higher end RAID card) running Windows Server 2022 Std.\n The server feels really solid and quick when its running and setting it up we've had no issue. However at some unknown point it's started taking a crazy long time to boot, like 40 - 45 mins. It just sits on the spinning circles forever although you can access file shares on it during this time and some other functionality is working.\n I've checked the logs and a large number of the services seem to be timing out while starting. There doesn't seem to be a pattern though and they are all kinds of different services covering different things. When the server finally does boot, the following services are stopped:\n Distributed Transactions Coordinator\n Diagnostics Policy\n Network Access Policy \n But if you click to start them, they seem to startup without issue and once it finally loads it all runs without issue and seems 100% fine.\n The server has the Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, DHCP, File/Print and NAPS roles.\n It's an absolute nightmare to debug because I make a change then have to spend 45 mins waiting to see if it works. There doesn't seem to be any errors other than the services are just timing out with the error \"A timeout was reached while waiting for <service>.\n Anyone seen this before?\n    submitted by    /u/Soup_Roll  \n [link]   [comments]",

How it works is Domain Users grouo has access at Data Shares top level and all sub folders have inherited permissions. \n But now i want to make 5 secure folders. Do i just disable inhertiance on these 5 sub folders, remove DomainUsers group and add security group (with correct users in).\n I have access based enumeration on Data_Shares so it's going to hide the folders for anyone not in.

I've tried to do some configurations on Remotedesktopconnection window such as colour depth, bitmap caching etc but no success.

          "description": "Hello. Seeking opinions. I'll keep out some of the details to keep it short. I need to get a redundant/backup internet carrier at a very important site for our small/med enterprise. It is a warehouse location. The wrinkle is that we are leaving this site in approximately one year, but up until that time it is crucial that if one ISP dies another is available. Our current provider is actually the cable company, who has an enterprise fiber division. The only other provider in the building is the legacy RBOC who has fiber.\n I have been getting quotes through a telco broker who works with multiple different companies that use the RBOC as the last mile/loop, but they either refuse to quote 1 year or the pricing is very high (over $1000) even for speeds like 50 or 100Mb. I have looked at satellite internet services which seem too slow. I have looked at 5G broadband, but my hesitation is that they seem to offer no guarantee as to speed or performance. The fine print literally says there is no minimum speed. I need at least 50Mb up and down to run the business in the event of a failover. Another option is business (not enterprise) class cable modem, from the same provider as my current service. I inquired about redudnancy/separation between the two services, they did not get too deep into detail but admitted that they did potentially share some of the same equipment.\n So what would you do?\n A) Get the wireless broadband service, and hope it doesn't suck horribly when needed\n B) Get the cable modem and hope the services don't ever go down at the same time\n C) Bite the bullet and try to convince ownership that we should pay the $1000 per month for the backup service, which is more than we pay for our primary service. The internet in this location has not gone down for at least 5 years, but if it did and we didn't have a working backup it would definitely cost the company more than $12,000 if it was down for a day.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/moneydontjiggle4sure  \n [link]   [comments]",

From there, Axon generates an XML and JSON file and wants to place those files on our network for other users to access so they can open the XML file and enter in data from it.\n Our Network team said this was impossible as Axon does not have anything that would connect it to our provate network. Axon says as long as a PC has internet access they could drop the files on a SFTP server here if we give them a user account for it. Our network team still said it was impossible even doing that because our SFTP server is a linux server.\n Who is correct here?\n    submitted by    /u/voltagejim  \n [link]   [comments]",

(or an auto-detect feature built into the vpn client)\n ​\n What I was thinking was:\n  \nThe VPN client when connected would work as its supposed to with routing policies and things of that nature\n When the VPN client is not connected it would monitor traffic based on policies and rules and when it detects that the system is attempting to connect to a resource on the destination network that is only available through VPN it would prompt to connect\n The idea is that people would be able to stay off the VPN and only initiate a connection when its required.\n Further it would reduce IT helpdesk tickets because rather than logging an IT ticket when they can't access a resource, only to find they haven't connected to VPN, the client application would pop up with a notice \"looks like you're trying to connect to your workplace, would you like to connect?\"\n The user could click yes or no and if they click yes then it would initiate the connection sequence (prompt for password, mfa, etc.)\n  \n​\n what do you guys think? let me know in the comments\n    submitted by    /u/roblu001  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For those of you who had admined Teams phones, you'll know that even with autosign in there are times the devices sign out. Users press buttons, bad updates happen, or in some cases they just seem to randomly sign out. Every teams admin I've ever talked to usually starts by confidently saying they don't have that problem before coming back later in the conversation and saying something similar to \"Well we did have a few devices sign out but that was because the password expired\" or similar. \n If you're familiar with Kari's law the basic premise is that there can be no barrier whatsoever to dialing 911. If it's a phone, you should not have to dial an outside line or take any special action to dial. But if you look at a teams phone, every single one says \"Sign in to make an emergency call\"\n How is that legal? I genuinely do not understand how, or how people are getting around this. Surely if an organization is using teams as a phone system with physical phones they're non compliant with Kari's law? \n What am I missing? Even with auto sign in there isn't a way to 100% guarantee a phone wont get signed out. \n I get that there's other issues here that need to be addressed. The need for cellular backup in case the internet goes down, or backup power for the phone system. And yes, I fully understand 'most people just use their cellphones', but I'm specifically wanting to address teams phones in this context because the way I see it, there's no way to be compliant with Kari's law unless you have someone physically checking each and every phone multiple times a day, even if it's in the hallway rather than being assigned to a user.\n    submitted by    /u/breenisgreen  \n [link]   [comments]",

I setup an Azure VM for one of the offshore folks and was able to do a DB restore and push to Azure SQL for some mock data.\n Anyway, yeah that's about it at the moment. Happy to answer questions if I can without doxing myself and all that happy crap.\n Oh, and I will re-iterate from the last time, the outpouring of support from this community was amazing and I truly appreciated all the positive comments and good will. \n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/0110010001100010  \n [link]   [comments]",

The desktop I had to use only had one monitor so I had to keep switching between my local desktop and the remote desktop windows. A really annoying issue with this type of setup is using keyboard shortcuts (combinations) in windowed mode for remote desktop is the short cut (i.e. Window+R, Windows+E, etc...)would apply to the local desktop instead of the remote host.\n So I decided to take a look at the advanced settings for RDP and found a setting that I don't remember being there last time I looked (many years ago), and under \"Local Resources\" > \"Apply Windows key combinations\" was the solution to this annoying issue. There you can select the option to apply the keyboard shortcuts/combinations to the remote computer, instead of \"Only when using the full screen\".\n I figured I would share, because I mentioned this to some of my teammates and they didn't know about this setting either.\n Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the Gold award!\n    submitted by    /u/Need_no_Reddit_name  \n [link]   [comments]",

Banging my head against the wall because I am clearly missing something obvious.\n I have two ASAv's in different locations, both with the same split tunneling setup. We have a internet based service that we use OKTA for Authentication and recently implemented a CA policy to restrict out bound networks from accessing.\n What we have discovered is that Location A seems to show OKTA our DC Public IP, Location B it see's their personal public IP.\n If you have a corporate IP you are routed internally to an on-prem appliance to authenticate. This doesn't happen in the other location, you are simply blocked.\n If my route of traffic is to an external internet based application surely OKTA wouldn't see my corporate DC IP. So how on earth does it manage to?!\n Gosh please help, tried explaining this to OKTA and got nowhere,\n    submitted by    /u/UncleTooTall  \n [link]   [comments]",

And crashes in software that was very reliable years ago from big companies like Cisco and Adobe.\n What the hell is going on here ?\n    submitted by    /u/NecrisRO  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've never met a sysadmin who actually wanted cold-calls from vendors. I've gotten plenty of (targeted) spam emails and calls, including to my personal cell (last one was from ADP... really? really?). I'm sure y'all get them too. Some of them even say \"I got your details from LinkedIn\" but they're using details that LinkedIn never had. They're likely getting your info from one of the big B2B services out there. So I went and compiled a quick list of 11 of the largest B2B databases, with the links to their opt-out/delete pages. \n This is especially useful if you're in CA, but should at least work if you're in the US or EU. All of them will require your (business) email and some other details to process the request, and some are more solid than others. It's also a good idea (if possible) to see what they have on you before requesting the delete -- that's how I found one of them that had my personal cell # attached.\n https://www.lead411.com/removeinforequest/\n https://www.adapt.io/check-my-email\n https://www.uplead.com/opt-out-request/\n https://preferences.clearbit.com/dont_sell\n https://login.seamless.ai/personalDataRequest\n https://rocketreach.co/claim-profile\n https://www.zoominfo.com//privacy-center/update/remove\n https://www.apollo.io/privacy-policy/remove\n https://www.cognism.com/data-opt-out\n https://www.lusha.com/privacy-center/request-access-data/\n https://leadiq.com/request-access\n https://clearbit.com/ccpa-opt-out\n https://login.seamless.ai/personalDataRequest\n If there's any other big ones I've missed, throw 'em in the comments!\n    submitted by    /u/MightyTribble  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, as you all know many businesses use shared Android devices to provide their employees with access to corporate resources. However, managing these devices can be challenging, as they are often used by multiple people and may be exposed to a variety of security risks.\n Problem that businesses face:\n The following are some of the problems that businesses face when managing shared Android devices:\n  \nSecurity: Shared Android devices are at risk of being lost, stolen, or tampered with. This can lead to the unauthorized access of corporate data or the installation of malware.\n Compliance: Businesses must comply with a variety of regulations, such as data protection laws and industry standards. Managing shared Android devices can be difficult to do in a way that meets all of these compliance requirements.\n Cost: Managing shared Android devices can be expensive, as businesses need to purchase and maintain the devices, as well as the software and services needed to manage them.\n  \nSolution to their problem:\n There are a number of solutions that businesses can use to manage shared Android devices. These solutions include:\n  \nMobile device management (MDM) software: MDM software can be used to remotely manage shared Android devices. This includes features such as remote wipe, password policies, and app management..\n Containerization: Containerization is a technique that can be used to isolate corporate data from personal data on shared Android devices. This helps to protect corporate data from unauthorized access.\n Bring your own device (BYOD): BYOD allows employees to use their own personal devices for work. This can help to reduce the cost of managing shared Android devices.\n  \nLearn more about Managing Shared Android Devices here!\n    submitted by    /u/ResponsibleHardship  \n [link]   [comments]",

After googling I found out the VIRL is now CML. We are a university \n They have different versions of CML and I have questions because I don't know how to interpret their site perfectly. This is the website I'm reading from: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/modeling-labs/index.html#~licensing \n Personal - Single use only. Does this mean only 1 person can be logged in at once and others must wait until they are done, or does it mean only 1 person can be logged in and it always the same person logging in?\n Enterprise:\n - Multi user - Maybe this is what I really need.\n - What does TAC support mean? Will I be able to call someone and they can help me if I get stuck in a lab? I doubt it. Maybe it means they support in the setting up of the VM and installing the software?\n Higher Education:\n - I work at a university. Would this mean I can use this type of CML? Why would I choose this over enterprise? The site says it licenses for concurrent users instead of nodes. This makes me think enterprise works like this: you have license for 20 nodes. User 1 logs in and uses 5 nodes. User 2 logs in and uses 15 nodes. User 3 logs in and has no nodes to use until the other 2 users shut their labs down. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Dunce-Learner  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's the situation:\n I have a packet coming from a client within my subnet (let's call it Subnet A), but it's intended for a server with a public IP address outside Subnet A. I want to translate the destination address of the packet, so that my router directs it to a private IP address within Subnet A instead.\n I've been trying to figure out how to accomplish this, but I'm not quite sure which NAT feature or configuration would be suitable for my case. I've explored options like \"Virtual Server\" and \"Port Forwarding,\" but they seem to be geared towards incoming packets from outside the subnet.\n I've read about Destination NAT but I checked the 5 different routers I have available at the office and none of them support DNAT. I've seen on the internet that some people use routers that work with line commands instead of an HMI interface, but I also don't have one of those.\n Can anyone guide me on how to achieve this translation within my network? Are there any specific NAT settings or techniques I should be looking into? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Kraenar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to get a single Palo Alto VM Series running in Azure, and I know Palo's pretty well but my Azure skills come and go as I don't use it all the time so I'm trying to get past the cloud specific nuances to be able to hit the mgmt IP via HTTPS and get to the normal firewall config stuff. I do understand azure basics like VNET's related to Subnet's which associate to Route tables and how UDR's are needed often times or inter-vnet connections, etc.\n My main issue is when I went to deploy the NGFW this time in Azure, I only have public subnet, Private subnet, and public IP. I remember and see in older documentation there was a management subnet to configure as well but I don't see that currently when configuring one.\n So my question is.... given the context that I just want to get a basic Palo up and running and reach it via mgmt.... not even worried about the nat stuff or data plane route tables and whatnot in azure yet..... what is the easiest method to do this? I can't seem to find a good guide or video on it... and I know it shouldn't be a process that technically needs one anyway, simple concept but I'm just not sure what to do next. Any help is appreciated and will be gifted with all the upvotes I have to gift. No gold because I'm mad about the API changes killing my RIF app though.\n ​\n Edit: and for the record if the public IP is what I'm supposed to be hitting, no dice currently, and there's no NSG associated with it.... if that public IP is the answer..... maybe I need to figure out how it relates to a route table and make a 0.0.0.0/0 to internet or something. but anyway, point still stands...

We're ruling that out due to signal strength being poor in the location at the best of times, and once you add in a significant audience, we wouldn't want to rely on it.\n They're approx. 50m from a nearby building, so we're probably within spec to just run a long piece of Cat6A through the window from an existing data point, but this cable will need to share containment with mains power (240V/50Hz), and so I think there may be both technical and regulatory issues with this? I don't want this to fail an electrical inspection just before the event and lead us to have to frantically replan.\n My two main thoughts are fibre from an existing switch in a ground floor room, or P2P Wireless, with a preference for fibre (for cost reasons as we'll always re-use SFP modules and switches, but P2P kit is less likely to find any future use for us.)\n Has anyone done anything similar?\n If fibre is the answer, what level of armouring/ruggedising is necessary?

Here are the details of the setup and topology\n https://imgur.com/a/WHVlUf0\n ​\n  \nPhysical connectivity: HQ Campus, datacenter Silicon Valley, and datacenter Seattle are connected via dark fiber on Nexus 9K switches.\n EIGRP: The Nexus 9K switches in each location (SE-SW, SV-SW, HQ-SW) are running EIGRP to exchange routes internally.\n BGP: BGP is configured on the Nexus 9K switches for external routing. In Seattle, the Nexus switch (SE-SW) has a BGP peering with a Fortigate Firewall (SE-FGT) on AS 65010. In Silicon Valley, the Nexus switch (SV-SW) has a BGP peering with a Fortigate Firewall (SV-FGT) on AS 65011.\n Redistribution: The firewalls (SE-FGT and SV-FGT) are learning the 172.22.1.0/24 network from their respective Nexus switches (SE-SW and SV-SW) through EIGRP redistribution.\n Partner1: Both Fortigate Firewalls (SE-FGT and SV-FGT) have a BGP peering with Partner1, which advertises the 10.0.0.0/24 network.\n  \nNow, here are my questions:\n  \nDo I need to configure iBGP between SE-SW and SV-SW? Both Nexus switches are already exchanging routes via EIGRP redistribution, so is iBGP necessary in this case?\n Is it necessary to configure BGP peering between SE-FGT and SV-FGT?

Their existing design is that they are terminating all their ISPs in the Fortigate & from there they are getting a LAN network (10.3.70.0/23 - Gateway:- 10.3.70.1) to an unmanaged switch. They have few servers on that switch & from that switch they are giving uplink to other unmanaged access switches. My work here is to configure a Core switch(9300L) which will have VLANs for Data & Voice & will handle all the inter-vlan routing & DHCP request as well as default route to the Gateway (FW). Easy, but the catch is that i can not touch the Fortigate firewall or change anything there. \n  \nIf i divide the /23 network into two /24 network, will there be any issue in the FW?\n \nIs there any way that can i put the servers on Data vlan(10.3.70.0/24) without changing their subnet mask?\n \nCan i terminate the LAN from the FW to Core in the Data vlan as an access port or is there a better way.\n \n If you have any good suggestions than feel free to let me know. \n *Sorry for the lengthy post.

The firmware file I received worked fine on the first three, but the last two are saying that the calculated md5 hash doesn't match the embedded md5 hash, and so they won't use it. I've tried with both 17.6.5 and 17.9.3. (I tried the 17.9.3 first, because it was what I was given, and after that didn't work, I thought to ask for the 17.6.5 as an intermediate step.) I've tried multiple downloads of each, but keep getting the same error.\n Now, not being a habitual Cisco person, I've been using the web gui to do these updates. I am well aware more netadmins prefer to use the cli, but I am just not good at the Cisco cli, so I avoid it. If there is something in the cli that I can use rather than the web gui, I'm willing to try it. I just don't know enough about the cli to know what to try right now. \n As for going to my corporate net admins, they are overloaded, and don't respond to tickets for months, so I can't really do much there.

Purchased 2 SFP+ MM Fiber 10Gbit fiber modules along with a 10Gbit MM fiber cable. Running a Unifi US-48-500W switch (Flow control/Jumbo Frames enabled). SFP+ Modules & MM fiber cable go directly from server SPF+ Port to SFP+ Port on switch.\n Windows shows full 10Gbit connection (Verified in Device Management that \"Speed and Duplex\" are set to \"10Gbps Full Duplex\") and Unifi Shows a 10Gbit connection in the console.\n We have 2 main NAS's configured in 802.3ad LACP (One Synology DS416 and one WD EX4100 both with RAID 5 4x 8TB drives) Both show 2000Mbps connections.\n T430 has 8x 8TB Drives and when copying a file (Not through network) from RAID to SSD boot drive, achieves ~360MBytes. So I know the RAID is at least capable of those speeds.\n Copying files from RAID to either single NAS averages around 110MBytes. I understand that LAG does not increase transfer speeds for single client as it will just use one connection technically.\n However, when trying to transfer data from the server to both NAS's, the Server NIC pegs out at 1GBit. Both NAS's should be able to take at least 1Gbit each and the server should be putting out 2GBits total.\n Also tried copying one file from Server to NAS and copying another file from Server to Desktop PC at the same time. Originally transfers around 100MBps and as soon as the 2nd file transfer starts, the server file transfer speeds are split between the two to about 50MBps each.\n Thoughts/Idea's anyone?\n    submitted by    /u/WorldlyFeature5282  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm no expert in that field but ideally shouldn't we have some logs about all the configurations in the router?

The thing is, let's say that there's a 1 second spike in the traffic, but no one was paying attention at the time and only realized it few minutes later.

The problem I am trying to solve with this, is that this requires a switch per device since these switches we are using only have 2 or 4 ports on. One port for the 192.168.1.0 IP and one for the IT Routable subnet. What I am wanting is either a fix to this without re-IPing the machines but a more central device that can handle the NAT's. I am thinking a 48 port switch that I can basically NAT the machine IP's in mass? Anyone got Ideas? If I am completely missing an easy solution please no hate.\n ​\n EDIT:: So the IE-2000, Could I implement that back at the Network cabinet and terminate all of the devices needing connected to it then have one uplink port to the OT Network and configure L2NAT instances for each interface?\n    submitted by    /u/ryguy6011  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Earlier post asking about V6 adoption. Dinosaur here, recollecting that the big issue for adoption late-90s early 2000s was that the design/policy was that enterprise V6 allocations were only from an ISP, there would be no Provider-Independent allocations. (I think this was because v4 routing tables were outpacing router memory at the time. Having ISP allocation allowed greater summarization) Naturally there was a storm every time this policy was brought up on NANOG. If one wanted to have more than one upstream for resiliency, there would be two entirely separate V6 address spaces. So a complex protocol came out of the Network Working Group: RFC 5533, Shim-6: Multi-homing Shim Protocol. When the policy was inevitably changed to PI allocations I felt so sorry for the folks who must have spent many meetings working out the Shim Protocol. PI address space allocation was the beginning of the long adoption process.\n    submitted by    /u/blahblahcat7  \n [link]   [comments]",

So for instance in the case of subnet A I get: log₂(13) = 3.7 --> and rounding up I find that I need 4 bits.\n Then I take the number of bits and adjust the subnet mask accordingly, so again in the case of subnet A instead of using /25 I would use /28 (because the 4 LSB are 0)\n Now I want to find the range of IPs for the subnet, so for subnet A I will start from 129.19.40.1 (since .0 is reserved) and go til 129.19.40.14.

I'm going to give a very simplified version of the problem I am trying to solve, for simplicity purposes.\n I hope that the smart people here can help me out so that I don't need to buy and install additional copper NICs.\n We are in the midst of a network re-design so I am trying to make do with what we have at this current time to try to make my new server function. In a nutshell, I want to combine what used to be two copper access ports from two physically separate networks to a single SFP connection which my new server has, and assign them to my VMs by VLAN. \n Old scenario:\n I have an old server that had 2 copper NICs each connected to respectively 2 physically separate networks. The access ports come from Cisco 2960X without VLANs configured. At this time, it is not possible to have these reconfigured.\n On the server, NIC1/Network 1 was attached to VM1, and NIC2/Network 2 was attached to VM2.\n This has worked fine for years.\n New scenario:\n I have a new server that only has 1 SFP port.\n Is there a way I can combine or (reverse) trunk these two networks so that my new server can see either network depending on what VLAN I assign to each VM?\n I tried to create two access ports, Port1 on VLAN10 for Network 1, and Port 2 on VLAN 20 for Network 2. I then connected Port 24 (SFP Trunk) to my new server. This didn't seem to work.\n I have been toying with the scenario and it doesn't work.

          "description": "We're looking at doing a refresh for our firewalls. For budget reasons our two main contenders seem to be Fortigate and Checkpoint.\n General office setup: no fancy routing so the edge devices will connect directly to the ISP over 10 Gig. Probably won't need BGP, but if we do in the future, it won't be any fancy (one ASN, one block of IPv4/6). Some SSL VPN will be used, but not heavily.\n Currently there will be only one fibre, but we'll probably get a second unit as a warm stand-by, so if the primary goes sides ways we could perhaps just move the fibre over. We may go with a second uplink later.\n Any preferences for Fortigate and Checkpoint? Palo Alto is often recommended, but that's a bit too much for us; Fortigate generally is also mentioned, but I'm curious about Checkpoint.\n Our co-lo DC will also probably need a refresh soon-ish, so we may go with the same vendor there as well. It's also currently 10Gig without HA. There we may stay with 10 Gig with the refresh, or perhaps go with a 100 Gig optic: not so much for the extra bandwidth, but for easier work with regards to provisioning and port availability: any difference with Fortigate and Checkpoint for 100G?\n Thanks for any info.\n (Internally the office gear will be access-layer PoE switches, APs, and a small server room. More familiar with switching gear, so have a good feel for the options.)\n    submitted by    /u/throw0101d  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use 3 different EIGRP AS so that the router of each office gets its default route by the ISP and redistributes it in the other EIGRP AS with a higher cost to have redundancy if the link between one office and the ISP is down.\n I wanted to take advantage of this change to simplify my architecture by using one signle OSPF area. But I don't know the best way to configure it. And that's mainly because all the routers & MLS are in the same VLAN meaning the OSPF cost from any core device to another is the same.\n Using multiple OSPF areas would probably work but I was wondering if you had better ideas.\n I've heard of the \"per-neighbor cost\" feature in OSPF but it isn't 100% clear to me if it's made for this kind of situations.

I know it is old tech and would be more secure and stable to use SSL.\n SSL connects okay but gives me issues when I try to load anything, from a webpage to RDP connections are incredibly slow (does not even load most of the time).

I have a few other SSL VPN connections from the same laptop that work fine through this network so I'm not sure where to start with the debugging on this one.

Currently we run the Meraki Go system in our 4 locations. It leaves a lot to be desired. The other day the firewall in one location had a port failure and their app never showed us that was the issue. We discovered it when we switched the ethernet cable from one port to the other. I find that defeats the purpose. It should clearly have shown me this was happening, but still it does not tell me there is a port failure. In the end, I just feel this system is not developed enough and I want to move on. \n I considered Barracuda, Palo Alto and Fortinet, but honestly, their price point, the business owner will not go for it. Not even close. \n Then I discovered Firewalla, its a lot closer to what I want, especially with the VPN system and MSP they have, but their yearly subscription really makes a reasonably priced product and decently expensive product. \n I thought I would pose this question to the /reddit world. Any alternative solutions I should look at, that may provide a solution that is better than meraki go, but more reasonable then firewalla. Or if Firewalla really is the real deal and I should sell my boss. Or, alternative solutions. \n Thanks for your time guys. \n Colin\n    submitted by    /u/colinbuffalo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone. I'm in a bit of a dead-end and was wondering if anyone here has any ideas. I know this is EOL hardware, but unfortunately that's what we have...\n Here is my saga: I have a Cisco 3750X-24P-L which I want to stack with a 3750-48P-S\n The reason I need to stack these is, apart from port density, the fact that the 3750X has PoE+ and a 10G uplink.\n The challenges:\n The 3750-48P-S can only run IOS 12, since it only has 16mb of internal flash, and IOS15 doesn't fit.\n The 3750X-24P-L is originally licensed with lanbase, which doesn't allow it to stack with non-lanbase switches. If I upgrade it to IOS15, I'm able to activate the RTU license and have it boot ipservice or ipbase, which would allow me to stack, but you can't stack IOS12 with IOS15.\n In IOS 12, I don't seem to be able to activate a RTU license, even with a \"universal\" image.\n In IOS12 it seems you can activate a 90day trial license of ipservices, I've tried that, but it seems my 90 days were already used. (These switches are old, before I worked here, and someone might have activated the trial in the past).\n I have tried formating the flash to see if the trial resets, or even changing the date, but no luck.\n Considering these switches are EOL and EOS, is there any other alternative? The famous website where Cisco would allow you to generate keys seems to have been long gone.\n    submitted by    /u/Strong_Percentage_39  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n We are currently facing a design issue with our Azure Expressroute setup, specifically with BGP between Microsoft (MS) and our Fortinet solution. Our setup involves two connections (two VLANs) from the firewall to Azure, and we have decided against using ECMP for various reasons. Therefore, we require an Active-Passive setup.\n For normal operation, we have successfully configured the Active-Passive setup using path prepending and local preference to determine the appropriate connection. When one of the peers goes down, failover occurs without any issues.\n However, we have encountered a problem during maintenance activities. If Azure initiates maintenance on the primary link, the BGP neighborship remains active, but traffic cannot flow through the connection. Before starting maintenance, MS pre-pends the primary connection. Unfortunately, since we rely on local preference, this pre-pending does not resolve the issue, as the local preference takes precedence over the prepending value.\n We have been attempting to collaborate with the Azure side (another IT supplier) to consistently pre-pend the secondary connection. This would allow us to eliminate the dependency on local preference. However, it seems that Azure does not support this configuration.\n Are there others who have experienced similar issues? We would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this challenge. Unfortunately, we have limited options since MS does not terminate the BGP neighborship during maintenance.\n Thank you for your assistance.\n    submitted by    /u/Tribunus-  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, so I'm at the start of migrating traffic over to an entirely new outbound pair of Palo Alto 3220's. Tonight I migrated over one of our lower end environments across to them, all went fine, security rules worked great etc.. the main issue was around a NAT rule I wanted to use for each environment, basically, we have a public address ranges that our WAN external firewalls sit on and an entirely different /27 public routed range that isn't on the same subnet etc.. this range is used on the current t ASA solution for certain environments, I wanted to use the free ones and migrate the ones in use across to the PA's in the end. To begin with I was using a free public address in this routed range to put on this environment along with a catch-all PAT to the outside interface as an alternative. Currently during my testing on one of my test vm's, the outside PAT works fine, however, when I turned on the source NAT to this free public address tonight, traffic dropped and stopped on my test VM! I have no clue why. The rule itself is setup like this:\n Scr zone : inside Dst zone : Internet Scr add : lower end environment range Dst add : any Scr translation : dynamic-ip-and-port to the public ip address object which is a /32 Dst translation: none\n Can someone tell me if I'm missing something here on the PA's? The NAT rule, security rule where both being hit on the counter and I could see the NAT sessions being natted to the routed public address as well on the CLI. Could it just be something the other end with our PE router providers?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use the SD-WAN side of things, but I wouldn't know where to start with the firewall features of them. I'm thinking it's a non starter, purely because of time that is available to me, how do they perform under stress or normal load using an SSL proxy, and normal firewall rule processing? It's a router first and foremost and shouldn't be used as a firewall if we don't have to, simple as essentially. But I'm curious to know if others have used them for this purpose and what their experiences have been?\n The Palo I'll end up getting in probably won't need more than 1Gb interfaces as well to be honest, if that helps in terms of bandwidth\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

There don't seem to be any packets being dropped. I've tried setting the DNS manually (the server itself, google, cloudfare) on the end devices to see if that changes anything, but no change there. Bandwidth usage is normal. Tried troubleshooting during active hours and also after hours, no change in speed. Tried adjusting TCP Window Scaling Settings on end-devices, updating drivers, verifying cables were un-damaged CAT5e or CAT6 cables, trying different network profile settings on end-devices, manually setting IP information, checked for malware...\n Can anyone offer me any advice or tips as to what I should be looking for here? I've been searching for answers online for a couple of weeks and nothing that has come up is helping.\n    submitted by    /u/Melodic2Melancholy  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I came into this effort to help a buddy, it was setup already using native Azure VPN gateway/etc.... there's also an Azure Firewall but it's not doing much currently. So the main issue is the distant end with the server wants the client to only come across the VPN using one public IP.... here's the fun part... for Azure VPN DHCP Pools it has to be a /29 or greater... so I can't just issue the client one public and call it a day. Additionally, the S2S VPN is using policy based traffic selectors and as such I can't also turn on NAT to turn a private pool into one \"port overloaded\" public IP. I also apparently can't just slap a NAT Gateway in there because when I attach a private subnet to it, and try to use that same subnet for VPN pool addresses, it throws overlap errors.\n ​\n So I guess in summary..... what is the right design strategy for this situation given the technical limitations (oh and they can't change their end until the next change window next week if we need to try anything, so we're just trying to figure out what we can do from our Azure end for now, if anything).\n ​\n Part of me thinks I should just slap a Palo VM on there, do globalprotect and a site 2 site and let the palo take care of NAT without complaining like Azure has been at me, but palo's are like $6k a month in azure, and part of me wonders if I should be using azure's native firewall in the mix in some way to help the situation or if I'm not using other native features correctly enough to get this straight.\n ​\n Any advice is appreciated, sorry for the wall of text, and RIP my favorite 3rd party reddit app soon =[\n    submitted by    /u/syntax24  \n [link]   [comments]",

For each hop we loose some throughput, so if we only have one router as the gateway at say one of the ends, at the other end we will have much decreased performance. I could setup the mesh such that the nodes at the first third will use router A as the gateway, the next third uses router B and the last third uses router C. This works fine, except we of course get dropped connections every time we roam from one third to another and the routers don't act as a failover for each other. Additionally, the roaming is slower when effectively switching between networks.\n One topology I've thought about it having each of routers A,B and C use another fourth router D as their gateway such that then at least at the connections come from the same place and then perhaps it would be possible to perhaps have a stable phone call throughout the tunnel when roaming.\n Problem is that I'm frankly a little too green to figure this out entirely on my own.

Each site has a pair of core switches that handle the intersite connections. Site A connects to site B via 2x1Gb links currently in a L3 Portchannel. Site B to Site C is single 1Gb and site C back to site A is single 1Gb link (all those using L2 connection with SVI's). Site B is getting an upgrade to Nexus cores so we will no longer be able to run a L3 PC with VPC back to Site A.\n I am curious what you guys would do with this topology. I am contemplating running routed links everywhere like this. Will EIGRP ECMP this traffic and utilize both paths by default or is their additional configuration that needs to be done? Any other pros/cons to this design?\n Another option I am tossing around is doing a simple L2-VPC and running SVI at both ends like this.\n I would love to hear your thoughts and talk through the different solutions here.

We have experienced multiple occurrences of memory leak on ACX1100 installed and would require reboot to be performed as workaround for the router to be performing again. Have verified that ACX1100 due to its design limitations, memory leak is occurring due to routes and/or routing processes which the router cannot handle. Would like to know if anyone have encountered the same issue and what has been the resolution in your network scenario.\n Monitored that memory leak on the ACX persists even after upgrading JUNOS from 20.2R2-S1.3 to 20.4R1.12. Verifying with JTAC, memory leak is triggered due to device configuration but the root cause for the permanent fix is due to software PR. I am still awaiting next service release for JUNOS 20.4R3-S8 to confirm with Juniper if memory leak issue finally resolved for next service release.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Aggravating_Ad5919  \n [link]   [comments]",

These switches are all running the Onyx operating system.\n We have deployed several sets of SN2010 switches for us and our clients over the past four years. We decided to upgrade to SN2100 to get more port density by using 100Gb optics and breakout cables. \n We configured a SN2100 switch and swapped it in for one of our SN2010 switches. \n This issue we are having is that whenever we connect a host one of the four breakout pairs, the port flaps every 30 seconds. We have configured the new switch port identically to our existing switches and connected to existing hosts that have Mellanox NICs in them. \n When we connect the same 10/25Gb breakout to another switch, we have no issues. We only experience the issue when we connect a host (server or workstation) with SFP+. \n We've used a 100Gb to 25Gb converter with both an optical transceiver as well as DAC cable and get the same results; the port stays up when connected to another switch (Mellanox or other brand) and the port flaps when that same connection terminates into a host (server or workstation).\n During the time the port is up, we have connectivity.\n Any ideas what this might be or what to try next?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/tmcmillan  \n [link]   [comments]",

A simple swap of cables and minor adjustments, and they're off to the races. \n There's one site that just won't cooperate. \n We cut over the site, and SLA monitors show 50%+ packet loss. Link itself has been end-to-end RFC2544 tested by the SP with no apparent issues. \n What's more, a backup link that goes entirely unused once the cutover is complete and testing is performed shows the same high levels of packet loss. This occurs only when traffic is pushed over the link; on idle packet loss is 0% across the board. The same behavior can be observed for latency and jitter. \n The existing link is unaffected. Regardless of a lower available bandwidth, it is largely stable. The backup link, if utilized when the original link is in place proves to be of a lower than expected quality when utilized, but it is wireless so there may be more elements causing that. \n The behavior of all monitored connections, including the unused backup link showing high packet loss when migrated to the new link is puzzling. I can only imagine that it would be down to electrical interference or poor grounding quality as I have tested all other elements isolated from one another to ensure it wasn't caused by the site equipment. Some hardware replacements or failovers have been made to no avail. \n The routing, switching, and new circuit are all in the same rack. The existing circuit is wall mounted in the same room. The backup link modem is in another room, but is connected by a single cable back to the rack and is otherwise not grounded. \n Would this be a reasonable element to look in to in order to troubleshoot the issue?\n    submitted by    /u/NotAnotherNekopan  \n [link]   [comments]",

For our business, it seems great so far given it can do per-packet flow over multiple connections rather than per-session flow so that we can aggregate multiple connection together for a single client. Being able to have a routed subnet is crucial for us given we host a few email servers, file servers, and websites out of our office. So, if we grab two velocloud devices and place one in our colo in the data center, and one here at our head office, are we able to propagate an IP block we get from the data center over the velocloud to use for our core router at the office? We have VPN connections, and lots of different configurations I'd rather not have to change and would prefer if we could use the velocloud to push us that routed subnet possibly via BGP to our router where it can pick it up.

Now I wonder what options I have for subnetting since I obviously don't want to put all of the devices on the WAN side. Still I'm trying to have redundant firewalls.\n I was thinking I could perhaps select one /64 for WAN and set up both firewalls to send RAs for the same internal /64 subnets and then ask the ISP to tweak timeouts to ensure failover happens without too much delay, like in this example: http://www.bscottrandall.com/9.2.5.html#ra-message-as-substitute-for-fhrp .\n Otherwise I guess I could ask them to route my /56 through e.g. the first IP in the block and then use VRRP on my firewalls. Not sure if they offer dhcpv6 prefix delegation (like you'd use on a typical home router) and not sure if I even want to use that, since it will limit my options for redundancy.

The tester sends the data to the input router that forwards the packet over one of the two transport routers to the output router and to the tester at the end and back again.

          "description": "Hello guys,\n Just need your opinions for those who have worked with out of band access devices as my work require one for lot of equipment such as routers/switches/firewalls in a data center. We are looking for a cheap alternative device that can be used temporarily on each equipment when doing interventions so it may not require many ports since it will be removed afterwards, maybe 4-8 ports. I did my research, mostly found that opengear models are pretty expensive.\n Opengear ACM7004-2 has 4 serial ports RJ-45, 4 USB ports, RS232 compatibility and is relatively small but price around $800. I found several models like these on their websites but with LTE which i don't really need. I was searching for cheaper alternatives. For the Opengear IM4208-2-DDC-X2-G, i don't have the price but has 8 ports RJ45/RS232, 1 usbport and has some good security features.\n Lantronix SLB console server has 8 ports and seems ideal but couldn't find its price and much specs about it, the SLC 8000 has 16 ports but seems pricey on amazon around $2000.\n The perle IOLAN SDG4 has 4 serial ports RJ45, RS232 local console port but cost around $1000. Surely there has to be a cheaper one.\n Digi CM 8 Console Server 8 Port has 8 RJ45/RS232 ports and 1 console port RJ45/RS232, i don't have the price for this one but it does feature auth like tacacs and radius.\n So normally a technician would plug in the console server to an existing switch (depending on the brand of the switch, i will have to preconfigure the OOB device to connect to it) and the equipments will be accessible via the switch. Normally most devices in the data center have RJ45 compatibility. What do you guys recommend using for this scenario or if you have used those i have listed or a variation of it ? Btw i've searched most on amazon but there isn't much available. Some websites are genuine but don't list the prices which makes it harder. Anyway, let me know what you think.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Square_Map7847  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Like many people starting out in this field I am from a Cisco background, but in my current place we are an Extreme shop, running EXOS series switches across each of our campus'. MLAGs are in use everywhere possible including all inter-switch trunk links. MLAGs were completely new to me when I started here, but I initially picked up how they work quite quickly, because I was previously using Multi-Chassis EtherChannel's back when I was operating Cisco 6500's in my last job. Lately though I've been tasked with migrating VLANs from old switches onto new switches, and I've run into problems where I've accidentally caused a loop to form by tagging a VLAN on the wrong trunk, which has royally pissed me off because this should never be allowed to happen. This is all because one of the things I've learnt regards MLAGs, at least where I work, is that we don't run any form of STP where MLAGs are used, because the two technologies do not work well together, which for us, means that STP is not enabled anywhere it should be within our campus LANs. My Cisco background has taught me you should never disable STP, and I completely agree. Why the fuck are we doing it like this? I'm angry and fed up of having my human errors magnified because we aren't running STP when we should. Yes, I know there are newer technologies now like SPB but we aren't going to be ripping up our entire network to change that now, no chance. I'm just really pissed off that this is the way it is.\n Is anyone else here an Extreme shop, running EXOS series switches, with MLAGs and STP enabled? \n    submitted by    /u/smartiedude  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I ask this question with many question marks in my mind.\n ​\n Part 1:\n I have PFSense firewall setup with 4 different IPSec tunnels running in place with no issue.\n Two of these tunnels are going to other PFSense boxes - no issues\n One is going to a SonicWall - no issues\n The last one is going to a edge router. - no issues yet\n ​\n Part 2: no issues yet\n Attaches another Edge router to the pfsense - no issues yet\n We now have 5 vpns in action.\n ​\n Part 3:\n VPN is created between the two edge routers - to each other - along with the vpn back to the pfsense box.\n Once the tunnel is created between the Edge Routers - the vpns from both boxes drop to the pfsense box. Remove the VPN tunnel from one of the edge routers and that edge router reconnects back to the pfsense box. Re add the VPN and the connection drops.\n ​\n We have tested each VPN separately and all works fine. Its like - once a edge router talks to another edge router, it kills all non-edge router connections. Very odd. \n ​\n So my thinking is there is some type of limitation in the edge os that is causing this issue.

However you would end up with LSA floods anytime there is a topology change, but maybe that is no longer a big deal since switch CPUs and memory have become more powerful nowadays.\n On the other hand there is BGP it's less \"noisy\" allows for better administrative control of the underlay network, however it would increase the complexity of the network configuration although that might not be a big deal thanks to network automation tools.\n    submitted by    /u/ghoststalker2k  \n [link]   [comments]",

They have a project where they need static public IP addresses for I think 12,000 devices. They've determined that port forwarding is not an option and of course there is no way to get that many IPv4 addresses. Problem is, the device we have to ship for whatever reason does not do automatic prefix delegation properly. Even if I manually configured router advertisements using the ISP's statically assigned network prefix, it still doesn't route properly.\n After a week of back and forth, finally engineering admits that the product doesn't support prefix delegation for the LAN side and that the only way to configure this is to use NAT66. I'm well aware of how NAT66 works and I'm aware that it serves no purpose in the IPv6 world. I agree that thinking NAT improves security is just silly.\n With all that out of the way, unfortunately I don't have any other options and we have to ship these routers out as working to the customer. I've read the RFC and seen some of the potential negatives of this, but I wanted to see if anyone has a real world scenario where a NAT66 deployment failed or caused issues. I don't know exactly the specifics of what this customer is deploying.

Problem is, the sheathing on the fiber doesn't specify if it is multimode or single. Nor is there any other identfying part number. Just the manufacture (Berk-Tek) and 62.5/125. I'm guessing this fiber was run in the arly 90's. Some fiber bundles are orange and some are blue (but not aqua). I'm guessing all the fiber was run in the early to mid 90's.\n ​\n So not being a fiber expert, is all 62.5/125 multimode fiber?\n    submitted by    /u/TAWPS19  \n [link]   [comments]",

In order to use it for remote sites, NGFW providers are going to have you set up an IPSEC Site-to-Site VPN on both WAN connections, or they will have you link both connections to a SASE broker for central cloud access to all needed sites. \n I guess what I am seeking is affirmation that my Idea of SD-WAN for remote site access is correct, or clarification of what SD-WAN is really doing for remote site access. \n For some context: I am a server admin who has self taught networking through my years at an MSP, and has implemented some fairly robust networks, but do to lack of formal education, I do not always understand what I am implementing until after I have implemented it.

As someone interested in networking technologies, I'm intrigued by the concept and its potential benefits.\n Before diving in, I wanted to reach out to this knowledgeable community to gather insights and experiences related to implementing Netmaker. If you have any experience with Netmaker or have considered using it, I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts on the following:\n 1. How does Netmaker compare to traditional centralized networking solutions in terms of scalability, performance, and resilience?\n 2. What are some notable use cases or scenarios where Netmaker shines the most?\n 3. Are there any specific challenges or considerations to keep in mind when implementing Netmaker, especially in a hybrid or multi-cloud environment?\n 4. What are your experiences with the security features provided by Netmaker, particularly in terms of data privacy and integrity?\n 5. Have you found Netmaker's documentation and community support resources to be helpful during your implementation journey? \n I'm eager to learn from your expertise and insights on Netmaker.

When we disconnect the Cisco stack from the topology, the upstream ISP’s MAC addresses appear on the network a few seconds later.\n Links go:\n Cisco stack (dot1q Po6) -> Dell S4048 pair in VLT (dot1q Po27) -> Dell S4048 pair in VLT (separate domain) (vlan 998 access) -> upstream provider switches.\n The Dell switches use RSTP, PVST+ is not enabled on them.\n Is it possible for the PVST+ BPDUs from the Cisco to be passing through the dot1q links (Cisco to Dell to Dell) and then finding their way to the upstream ISP’s switchports which triggers their BPDU protections? I’ve read an article (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/spanning-tree-protocol/24063-pvid-inconsistency-24063.html) which talks about PVID inconsistency.\n The ISP side has two L2 lines and spanning tree is used to control which line is used.\n    submitted by    /u/tdic89  \n [link]   [comments]",

We currently have an Active/Passive Fortigate cluster in place, however, below the Active/Passive cluster is our core switch which is a single point of failure.

Please see my concerns below and feel free to share your opinions.\n Network Diagram - https://imgur.com/tR00ax3\n ​\n  \nI understand that stacking at the core isn't the greatest idea, because of the shared control plane, however, we aren't a 24/7 facility, however, I do like the sounds of being able to update the core switch and not having to worry about the network going down.\n Reguardless if I stack or don't stack the L3 switches, will I need LACP to go from the Firewall to my L3 core switches?\n What's the added complexity with not stacking the switches? I believe that stacking the core switches and making one logical switch reduces config complexity, right?\n  \n​\n What do you guys think, should I stack at the core or keep the L3 switches separate?

Can't figure out why, and was curious if anyone here encountered this before or know if its possibly a problem with GNS3 and wouldn't happen on real devices?\n More detail:\n Small network I am currently simulating in GNS3 to learn more about how to implement L2LS consists of 2 spine switches (VLT Pair), 1 standalone leaf switch, and 2 leaf switches that are a VLT pair. OOBM switch in place for VLT backuo links\n I have 2 VLANS i am using to test routing. On each leaf switch I have two docker containers connected to it on each vlan. I am not yet testing any kind of VLT port channel from leaf switches to \"server\" just single connections for now.\n LEAF1-P1 -> SPINE1-P1 LEAF1-P2 -> SPINE2-P1\n LEAF2-P1 -> SPINE1-P2 LEAF2-P2 -> SPINE2-P2 LEAF3-P1 -> SPINE1-P3 LEAF3-P2 -> SPINE2-P3\n SPINEX-P1 are in VLT-PC1 SPINEX-P2/3 are in VLT-PC2 LEAF2/3-P1/2 are in VLT-PC2\n VRRP setup on SPINEs with virtip 192.168.X.1\n On Leaf1 I have a docker container with IP 192.168.2.50 trying to ping the docker container on LEAF2 with IP 192.168.4.51\n When that happens I get 3 duplicate responses.\n Basically what is happening is that SPINE1 (the main VLT/VRRP) gets the packet to be forwarded from VLAN 2 to VLAN4, and routes it appropriately. SPINE1 then sends that packet over VLTi to SPINE2, and then SPINE2 ALSO routes and forwards that packet. So the 192.168.4.51 gets 2x ping request. THEN, the same kind of doubling occurs on the response back ending uo with 4 responses sent to 192.168.2.50.\n Has Anyone seen this before? Is this expected behavior and I am messing up by trying to do L3 routing in a L2LS Network?

We can through inspection of the COPP control plane policy commands see that the router is dropping BROADCAST (Policier Queue 0) packets.\n I have to say I am a bit surprised to see the 9500 has default only 750pps rate limit for broadcast globally. How are people handling this and making sure bugged traffic, DoS or even just AVoIP devices doesn't stop DHCP relay from working \"globally\"?\n The traffic is not DHCP traffic, it's UDP 192.168.0.1->192.168.0.99, but the L2 destination is ffffff-ffffff.

However, the Wireguard server itself also has an IPSec tunnel set up to the 10.168.106.0/24 network and traffic from 172.16.0.0/24 to this network does not work.\n In the second phase of IPSec there is no client VPN class - 172.16.0.0/24 and I can't add it because I don't have access to the other side, so it can be done through NAT addressing 172.16.0.0/24 to any address that exists in the second phase, e.g. 192.168 .10.250 if traffic is routed to 10.168.106.0/24.\n Unfortunately, I don't know which iptables rules I should use to implement this.\n    submitted by    /u/kwiatek1001r  \n [link]   [comments]",

When we connect to the VPN, there is no ssl warning prompt for the cert being untrusted. \n I have checked that the root CA (also self signed by PA) is not present on the client machines. \n If this is the case, is there any significance of having this cert setup correctly? Does the client just accept the cert no matter the details.\n I have noticed, that when we first add the portal IP, there is a warning only initially but no warning when connecting to the gateway.\n I tried looking at docs but couldn't find what I was trying to understand here.

I've been mainly using Cisco and I have found that I really just need a L2 switch with secure mgmt. If I could find a switch that just has basic L2 features and a few that might not be so common, that would be great. My access switches just provide connection to thin clients, VoIP phones, and printers, so I don't see a reason to spend money on cisco products and licenses if I can just buy something more simple. But then again I don't really know if Cisco is currently the most expensive route.\n Here's what I'm looking for in an access switch:\n -RSTP, (and MST if possible)\n -802.1q\n -LACP\n -PoE\n -SSH\n -SNMP\n Things that would be nice:\n -TACACS+ (or other encrypted mgmt aaa)\n -802.1x and or MAB support\n -HTTPS interface\n Just curious what is out there that might be cheaper. It seems like every time I put a new switch in place I just add the vlans, enable portfast for the hosts, configure username/tacacs, disable services, prune the trunk and if I'm feeling crazy double check the root bridge. I don't need VRFs, VXLANs, or GRE. I definitely don't need BGP or even OSPF lol \n Let me know what you guys use for access switches.\n (I'm currently using Cisco 9200/9300s)\n    submitted by    /u/John_Greed  \n [link]   [comments]",

As I have the option to standardize our sites, I think using Aruba will still be a good option, but I'm all ears.\n Ethernet or SFP should be fine, I would be looking at deploying 1gb while we wait for hardware for 10gbe connectivity.\n Any suggestions on what I should look into?

          "description": "I've been trying to find a solution to a weird issue I've been having for a few days now, and this is my last hope. I've got a pair of SRX340 firewalls which I acquired in order to replace a pair of dell R330 boxes running PFSense. The goal here is to use them just for an IPsec tunnel into our GCP environment.\n As a precursor, the current PFSense boxes are in operation with one GCP tunnel each, sharing a GCP VPN gateway. When I run an iperf test over them, I can get up to 600mbps per tunnel. Plenty for what I need.\n However, when running a simple configuration in a test environment using the Google community guide for SRX devices, I'm only getting ~230mbps of possible bandwidth over the firewall. To be clear on this example, it's one SRX340 with one tunnel to GCP, dynamic routing, a gigabit WAN connection with a static IP on ge-0/0/0, and I have a laptop plugged into ge-0/0/1 on the device to run iperf3 over. Without the SRX340 in the mix, I can get 930mbps iperf3 over the internet to my test VM in GCP.\n My issue is with the 230mbps number. The SRX340 is rated for up to 733mbps of IPsec bandwidth, and I'm running the configuration given as an example in the Google guide. I just can't seem to break that speed barrier. Am I missing something or is this what I'm to expect out of an SRX340?\n    submitted by    /u/isonotlikethat  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems like it's not possible to say \"vlan 1 is globally Desktops,' for example, and have all org-wide site-specific Desktop prefixes be assigned to, and appear under, the same VLAN object. Is this correct? \n Right now I have (for example) a \"site_vlans\" vlan group for multiple sites, and an individual \"vlan 1\" assigned to each group/site. This is all well and good, but suppose you have 100 VLANs and 10 sites. Are you required to maintain 1000 VLAN records in Netbox?

A recent change I made for them was to set their QoS bandwidth cap for their free GUEST wifi network to 10Mbps. After applying the update, I went to the hotels lobbies to test it out with my laptop. Interestingly enough, I'm getting on avg. about 4-6Mbps speeds and I'm also seeing that it will fluctuate from 5Mbps, then burst to 8Mpbs, then back to 4Mbps and so on and so on. I'm assuming this is normal behavior you see when you've placed a bandwidth cap on the wifi network, but I'm not 100% on this. If not, let me know.\n When I'm on the casino floors, I'm getting correct QoS speeds (The property is a hotel & Casino), I'm also seeing burst here and there but overall speeds are right on the money.\n Currently using Cisco WLC3504 with Cisco 2802i APs.\n This might be an easy answer for some of you Wireless Cisco ninjas.

The company (railway operator) which uses our system in the field wants us to join their already deployed MPLS network. In this case, we need to share the network infrastructure with other systems like CCTV, IP phone etc. Otherwise we are going to install our closed loop for communication between control center and remote equipments, which is a general approach we have taken so far. Our concerns for sharing the common network devices with other systems are bandwidth, latency and security.\n As far as I know CCTV data is prioritized in MPLS QoS. Can our safety-critic data be prioritized higher than CCTV packets?\n Also in case of a failure in other subsystems, may a technician misconfigure the MPLS router in a troubleshooting process so that our routing configuration also be affected badly?\n I remember that with RSVP, pre-defined bandwidth can be allocated to a specific tunnel, can we rely on that?\n The good side of entering to MPLS network is that we don't need to spend a great amount of equipment cost to deploy our separate network. Also we won't need to worry for failures and maintenance.\n In case we decide to involve to MPLS network, we need some commitments from operator on bandwidth reservation and max latency we are going to experience, right?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/AdventurousComputer0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I'm a networking guy, NOT a linux guy unfortunately so I'm coming at this from a very green position. We've used RANCID in the past but viewvc has been giving us fits for a while and Oxidized looks pretty cool so I decided to give it a shot.\n I installed it on Ubuntu and I got it to the point where oxidized is running as a service and I can see the configs it's capturing but I've been unable to get nginx working to access it on the web. If I'm understanding it right (and I may not be), Oxidized is running a local web server on port 8888 and nginx is supposed to listen on port 80 (and 443) and then reverse proxys web traffic to the oxidized site.\n Right now when I go to the server on the web I get a 502 Bad Gateway message and I'm not sure what needs to change. I'm pretty sure it's something in the nginx.conf or sites-enabled/default files but I'm not sure.\n Here's the current (sanitized) contents of my /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default file: https://pastebin.com/Dx2jrEDU\n And here's the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default: https://pastebin.com/KfGnJk16\n ​\n Like I said, I'm not a Linux guy so please take it easy on me :)\n    submitted by    /u/MScoutsDCI  \n [link]   [comments]",

They respond and action to various alerts. My team has developed very detailed process on how to respond to these alerts (ex. device down). The process is currently documented in a flow chart and we’re looking at next steps to bring this to our Operations Team.\n I’d love to be able to have something that is user input driven - I’m imagining something web-based that prompts them for Yes or No / Choice A or B type inputs and then leads them to the next steps.\n For example…device down…. Is there an active change being performed by the Network Team or vendor? (Yes/No). Based on the selection the next input would be something like… IF No… Is it a single device down or multiple… and so on.\n I’d love this format over something like an incredibly long word document with anchors.\n Here’s an example of something that I found - albeit maybe really out and outdated(?) - that paints a picture.\n http://www.brflows.com/index.html\n    submitted by    /u/Spirited_Chipmunk_46  \n [link]   [comments]",

Network is fairly simple with just a handful of VLAN’s, RSTP, DHCP reservations/assignments, and IGMP snooping. \n Now, onto the setup; switch (Cisco CBS-350 8 port switch in a touring enclosure) has just two VLANs active: VLAN 11 and VLAN 21, with VLAN 1 being the native VLAN as per Cisco standard. One PC on VLAN 11, and one device functioning as a ping responder on VLAN 21. \n The problem I’m having is the pc on VLAN 11 is able to ping the gateway for VLAN 21, as well as ping the device on VLAN 21 (though the ping only makes it TO the other device, it is not able to be sent back to VLAN 11). Problem only seems to arise when the PC is provided an IP with DCHP, when the PC is set to static IP in the same range I’m unable to ping the gateway of other VLANs.

Anyway, management has approved a replacement switch, and I was rather hoping to find something that has at least some 2.5Gb ports as the PC's with the i225/226 ports all support that speed. Most of the cables have already been replaced with CAT6 already.\n No fancy networking scenarios here, just a single location of 40 or so mixed devices and the only requirement is LACP for the link aggregates on two Windows servers and a NAS. I will have to replace the WiFi setup as well so the 2.5Gb ports will come in handy for that and POE would be a plus but not a requirement. Having researched for the past few days I've come up with these:\n Juniper EX2300-48MP (16 x 2.5 GbE ports)\n EnGenius ECS2552FP (16 x 2.5 GbE port)\n FS S5800-48MBQ (48 x 2.5 GbE ports)\n People seem to have fairly positive things to say about the Juniper and I'm leaning that way (if I can find it in stock anywhere in Canada). However, I'm just wondering if I'm getting myself into a much more complicated situation that requires support contracts and subscriptions to cloud things and other enterprise-y stuff that I don't need. I abandoned Cisco years ago because the beancounters didn't want to pay for the yearly support contract and I couldn't get any firmware updates after that. I did have an account rep at CDW that I would go to for info but seems they're ghosting me. Am I fine just purchasing the hardware or should I really try to find a different VAR to make sure I'm getting everything I need?\n    submitted by    /u/Raquel427  \n [link]   [comments]",

The 9300 didn't work until I added a static route to the core switch. \"ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 \"core ip\" \".

          "description": "I feel like I already know the answer to this question. I was having a discussion about design with one of my bosses and I think we are in a disagreement about security best practices and practicality of implementing this type of design. \n I think its normal to have your data VLAN, voice VLAN, WiFi/Guest VLANs, IOT VLAN, server VLAN, and perhaps others as needed. I also think its normal for a lot, if not all, of this traffic to hairpin to the local firewall. This may add a very slight amount of latency, but its worth it because of the added security letting the firewall inspect, monitor, and log traffic. \n I think we have fundamental disagreements about network designs. I think hed prefer everything to be as flat as possible, but that is extremely messy. And makes troubleshooting difficult sometimes. As well as implementing changes on the fly. If data and phones are on the same subnet, you can run into QoS issues if you just start throwing on SSL inspection. \n Anyways, my point is this type of design should not be considered \"over-engineered\" for even a small to medium sized business. MAYBE a mom/pop shop with 10 employees, a DC, a file server, and a couple printers its overkill. But, otherwise as you start to grow you NEED to take these things into a consideration otherwise it becomes a mess.\n    submitted by    /u/hotpancakezz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, sooo, yesterday I got burned really really badly on a Palo Alto pair that I'm migrating traffic across to. Long story short, it was a mistake my end, I had a NAT rule where I wanted it to NAT to the interface address of the outside interface and I had it built like this....\n Original Packet: Src Zone: Inside Dst Zone: Outside Dst Int: e1/1 Scr Address: entire 10/8 range Dst address: any\n Translated Packet: Src Translation: dynamic-ip-and-port Address-object for outside interface IP Dst address Translation: any\n The problem was, the address-object on the translated packet was what is on the outside interface, including the subnet mask of a /28!! Which royally messed everything up! I'm guessing that it was proxy-arping out for all the addresses in that range/subnet and it ended up killing our current live outbound firewalls!\n What I SHOULD have done is have another address-object that was the same address but on a /32, is that right? That's what I have now, but holy fuck am I scared to switch it back on! Even when going through a change!\n I noticed you can set it to translate to the interface address, interface and IP Address as well? Would this do the same as above when I mentioned about what I should've done instead?\n The PA NAT is definitely a different concept when coming from an ASA and Firepower world! And I lost a lot of confidence and have been pretty hard on myself ever since that happened yesterday and not seeing that!\n Would I be alright doing either of the 2 revised ways mentioned?\n The reason why I switched this particular NAT rule on was that its meant to be a catch all for PAT to the interface address, we have a large routed range that is natted to specific public IP's and they're currently live on the ASA's, so I can't enable those specific ones on the PA's yet, so I needed a way to get the outside interface working to test a few VM's in one of the lower end environments\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since the team that commissioned this have no idea about loops, cluster *tunnels* had no redundancy, and one branch cluster member at a time can't connect to DC.\n TAC made tunnel redundancy with full mesh tunnels. No VRRP used anywhere. The problem is since SSID VLAN connected to same L2 domain, network has now big problem, loop.\n I'm looking for solution, since branch load balancing has no issues so far, and SSID not bridge on branch, we need solution for DC side.\n What do you think about ,we should use Aruba tunnel groups, Branch primary tunnels goes to physical address of first DC cluste member and secondary goes to second cluster member.\n Or\n We just use VRRP for branch destination and DC source. I saw a Airheads post about VRRP standby never use this tunnel unless VRRP active realy goes down. So far no loops.\n Any help would be appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/tablon2  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been a staunch supporter of Arista in the datacenter but the 720 series just don't seem to make sense from a price to performance perspective (7 - 10k for a 24port POE switch...) . I really like Juniper's EX switches and the mist APs have been solid when I have deployed them in the past. However I am already deploying Fortinet / FortiAPs at other locations. I ideally wanted to avoid Cisco and have no experience with Aruba. I was thinking a mix of FortiGate FW \\ AP's and Juniper Switches (POE and Access) would probably work but would be curious to hear what other folks would opt for and why. Lets say for this exercise the site is 25k sqft over 4 floors with a comms room on each with structured caballing between comms rooms and to the floor ports. Cable runs for the AP's are already done. The Site will host about 100 - 150 users at peak. All you have to do is choose the hardware configure \\ install and manage it. Oh I suppose for external connectivity you could have dual DIA at the site with SD-WAN or P2P circuits to local DC locations if that makes any difference. \n ​\n  \nSwitches - Juniper EX (POE)\n Firewall - FortiGate 100 or 200f HA\n \nWireless (APs and Controller if required) - FAP-231G (FortiGate as the controller)\n  \n   submitted by    /u/apresskidougal  \n [link]   [comments]",
