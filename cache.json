IDOR vulnerabilities are access control vulnerabilities enabling malicious actors to modify or delete data or access sensitive data by issuing requests to a website or a web application programming interface (API) specifying the user identifier of other, valid users. These requests succeed where there is a failure to perform adequate authentication and authorization checks.\nThese vulnerabilitie…",

In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a webshell on a critical infrastructure organization’s non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance. The webshell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim’s active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network-segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement.\nThe victim organization…",

I have one machine that keeps timing out connecting to the file share. This machine wasn’t setup or configured any differently than the others. \n I’ve checked all the common issues that are shared by all clients - network speeds, Synology SMB settings, MTUs, etc, and I’ve been unable to replicate the issue on another machine. \n I’ve also tested other variables on the client machine - different remote IPs/connections, different logins, as well as different transfer protocols - FTP, https, WebDAV. I’ve tried mounting the file share as a mapped drive and as a network connection. \n No matter what, when this machine is connected to the VPN, it can connect to the share and navigate the directories fine, but as soon as I try to transfer any file, it times out and if I’m using SMB it will freeze Windows Explorer. \n 2 other notes: - when connected to the VPN and I try to load a local IP in a web browser, say, the Synology admin portal, it also times out - the WebDAV connection has the same issues over https even when not connected to the VPN. \n What could this possibly be, and how do I test for it?\n    submitted by    /u/luckaeweb  \n [link]   [comments]",

VMware HA services are another option but again, the business seems to think that always available is the absolute only solution regardless of patching. \n At any rate, I genuinely appreciate the sub's feedback and any experience on this!\n    submitted by    /u/Pingjockey775  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm hoping to see if there is a script I can run on a server that points to a list of IP addresses of these PCs or their DNS name and grabs the last modified date and then puts all this into a simple csv that I can import into a DB or show in Grafana, but a CVS is just fine. The hard part for me is scripting.\n Do you think this is possible? I have been give a local account these PCs all have too. I'm not sure if I should be Googling PS or Python for this either.\n I think with PS I can use the Get-ChildItem 'D:\\temp\\test.log' command for this as I tested on my home PC and it works or Invoke-Command {Get-ChildItem \"D:\\temp\\test.log\"} -ComputerName DESKTOP-1234. I'm just researching on how I can build a script that points to a source list in a .txt with the remote IPs and include the username and password and push to CSV.\n Has anyone done anything like this before and think it's possible?\n I was thinking of putting Telegraf of a Prometheus plugin on each PC, but I'm not allowed to, these would have push this data to InfluxDB or Prometheus. I have to use a server to pull this info.\n Any advise or examples would really be nice if someone has 2 mins to spare and get me on the right path.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/bgprouting  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now all inbound calls to our dispatch center that come from AT&T wireless or any voip providers are staticky. Outbound calls are fine. Calls from Verizon wireless are fine. Calls from other Frontier Centranet lines are fine. You might think this is an issue with Viper except we have a second non-police location that has a interactive voice response system that is also having issues and it too uses frontier Centranet lines. Frontier came out earlier today and decided the issue wasn't theirs and closed a couple of tickets and said they would return on Monday to continue investgating. The problem is our police dispatch center cannot wait until Monday -we need to get a dispatch now and I've had no luck getting anybody to come out. Anyone else ever run into this issue?

He specifically stated that he's been using windows 7 since its inception and that it's the last enterprise worthy OS release from Microsoft, and that he believes windows 10 is more about advertising and selling user data than being an enterprise/business oriented OS offering. \n He claims he came from the security sector and that they were able to accommodate him at his last job with a Windows 7 machine, and that that place \"was like fort Knox\", and that with a good anti virus and zero trust/least privilege there should be no concern using it over windows 10. \n At first I didn't know what to think.. I began downloading windows 7 updates in WSUS to accommodate the request. Then I thought about it more, and I think it's a lose lose for me. If I don't accommodate, I'm ruffling the feathers of the new CEO and could be replaced as a result. If I do, and it causes some sort of security breach, my job is on the line.

          "description": "Hello everyone!\n Problem 1 - So the environment has about ~1000 computers. We had maybe half of the computers have uptime over 7 days, and a third over 14 days. \n Problem 1 fix - I created a task a couple of years ago in PDQ, but have moved to Ninja, to create pop-ups using the msg.exe stating your computer's uptime is more than X days! Please reboot.\n Problem 2 - Now we only have about 30-50 computers that have over 18 days uptime. \n Opinion - I think the best course of action would be to force shut down the computer after 4 days (4 days for the reason of the weekend, month end, payroll, etc...) and have a pop-up counter every now and then showing it's going to happen. I was going to run a shutdown /s /t 345600, but I'm unsure how to make a pop-up with the date or time of the force reboot. It does do a pop up when executed and when there are I think 5 or 2 minutes left. I could make a different pop-up at noon, for people at 19 days, 20 days, 21 days, and 22 days, with a comment of the reboot will happen in X days at noon (X hours) and possibly -a the previous shutdown command. \n Why? - We have seen a large reduction in tickets from these pop-ups, and fewer complaints about stuff being slow. However the 80/20 rule of 20% of your users will create 80% of the problems, and of course, those 20% refuse to reboot their computers.\n    submitted by    /u/bobsaysvoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n So I was wondering what SMTP service people are using as I am scouting for alternatives. \n We are currently using Sendgrid SaaS through Azure and relay mails through a hosted SMTP server to Sendgrid. This is mostly because most of the printers we use do not support passwords longer than 64 characters so the sendgrid API key wont work. We use IP whitelisting instead of authentication ( not the best solution i know)\n  \n However, we are growing and more services are using the Sendgrid tenant. Some systems that use this have supporters that would like access to check the mail logs for these services, however, since all the domains are in the same service, and there is no way of restricting ther access to certain domains ( as far as i know) it is starting to become a pain in the ass.\n Thought about setting up a seperate SendGrid for these services, but then DKIM and DMARC will be acting up.\n  \n What is everyone else using and what can you recommend?\n Basically looking for something that supports basic auth or ip whitelisting for printers, or relay from SMTP and where we can delegate access based on domain and/or service.\n    submitted by    /u/gahd95  \n [link]   [comments]",

My Manager was very knowledgeable and taught me a lot about the general day to day of doing support.\n After about 9 months, the Manager went on sick leave, which was fine at first as there had been times where I was on my own for the day to cover annual leave/weekends etc. After a week of him being on sick leave and completely out of communication I was starting to get concerned as even though I was handling my day to day tasks, I was starting to get more questions that I had no idea about, and would usually pass up to the Manager. I had to very quickly learn how to manage all of the IT requirements for the college, updating business critical software, dealing with suppliers, deciding on purchases, managing the IT budget etc. \n The Manager never came back from his sick leave, I only saw him 1 more time about a year later when he came in to collect some stuff. I ended up being a 1 person IT department for 9 years and was very comfortable doing that role. The only reason I left is because the college merged with another larger college and I would have had to become a smaller role in a 6 person IT department, which felt like a step backwards.\n    submitted by    /u/pfrary  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So long story short we had a \"pentest\" by our cyber insurance company which seems like they just did a basic port scan. \n ​\n They are highly concerned to the point where they may not give us coverage because of this:\n ​\n They found port 443 open on our Cisco router for our VPN. They can go to the external IP and it resolves to a cisco page (X.X.X.X/+CSCOE+/logon.html). If you have credentials for that portal, you can download the Cisco Anyconnect client. I went to an external network and tried it. I couldn't find any other functionality to that page other than the client download. \n ​\n All of this stuff was set up long before my time at the company, but is this not standard? From my understanding the router portal is a feature that was put there on purpose. \n ​\n They are really insisting that we shut down access to port 443. I am really insisting that closing that port would render our VPN services non-existent. \n Are they being idiots? Am I being an idiot? Are we all being idiots? VPNs and routers are NOT my strong suit so I'm worried I'm missing something obvious. \n Should I stand my ground that this guy who did the port scan doesn't understand VPNs?\n    submitted by    /u/RobotTreeProf  \n [link]   [comments]",

Despite several reports to proofpoint with permalinks to the offending emails and a description of the problem they are still coming and I had to block that domain, but it will only stop them until they change to another domain. I am also filtering for the phrase \"Please Protect your account\" the subjects so far have been userfirstname.userlastname, Please Protect your account, with the same thing showing up as the first line in the email\n I have saved the .eml files for several dozen of these emails and sent them to Amazon EC2 abuse and they have been extremely unhelpful. You would think they would want to stop these assholes as it is making them look bad for allowing it to happen. I am to the point of just blocking all emails coming from any amazon aws or ec2 site.\n If I block .png attachments it will probably mess up email signatures that use png files.\n It is getting annoying, as these emails sail right through Microsoft's defender phishing detection and through proofpoint since they are using a png file to try to trick people into falling for the phish.\n    submitted by    /u/doctorevil30564  \n [link]   [comments]",

How to handle that? \n AFAIK - FIDO2 keys are not an option along with OATH hardware tokens - Microsoft doesn't support that for guest accounts. \n Maybe software tokens?

When i try to connect to the Server manually it works just fine. At the moment i gave the users a script, which removes all NetDrives and connects them again.

When my users send an email with an attachment internally, Message Trace shows that it grows by roughly 5%, I assume due to encoding and headers. However, when sending outside the org, the growth is more like 50%.\n I've had users send emails to external orgs with an attachment that's ~28MB in size. But by the time it leaves Exchange servers, Message Trace shows that it's sitting at ~38MB. This is above the default size limit of 35, so the messages are then rejected by recipients (and the icing on the cake, the sender doesn't get a bounce back).\n Has anyone else suffered this issue and found solutions or information as to what's going on?\n    submitted by    /u/Stump_Chunkman_  \n [link]   [comments]",

He was who I worked with most.\n My boss and the CTO want to roll out Intune since we're 365 and our licenses are right. \n I'm in the very early stages of building policies and testing them. They want the initial policies simple and aimed at mobile devices. So IOS and Android.\n I created an Android policy, tested it on my phone, and made notes.\n I went to create a Conditional Access Policy and didn't have the rights. So I reached out to ask for them. \n The engineer called me and made me second guess myself. He wanted to knkw why I needed a conditional access policy and not just a device policy.\n And I still don't understand the question or logic behind it. Because if I create Device Policies but not Conditional Access Policy - there would be nothing in place to force people to enroll their devices. The device policies would be pointless.\n Maybe he didn't understand I was testing. But I said the word testing multiple times.\n Am I nuts? I need a Conditional access Polocy or it's all moot, correct?\n If I want to not allow users to be able to use say 365 apps on their phone unless their device is enrolled and compliant - I need a conditional access policy forcing them to enroll their device.\n I think I'm just fried for the day and need to take off early and reset.

I've also noticed a lot of internal problems which were brought up but never fixed can be listed as follows:\n - All of us are forced to use personal phones for work; after bringing such a thing up both my boss and management explicitly told me that if I don't like it, I can always buy a new phone that I can use for work at my own expense.\n - At the same time, both my boss and management adore splurging money on parties and other such things.\n - As soon as work is lightly inconvenient everyone expects me to deal with it.\n - They also expect me to both clean other people's messes AND do my job at the same time.\n - All of the things I've learned so far I've learned on my own (except for a few things).\n - Whenever I try to complain about those problems with my boss or management I'm met with empty promises.\n Should I keep going?

          "description": "Looking for some ideas. We're purchasing 50x interactive displays for classrooms. The Android they come with is pretty average, so I'm hoping to repurpose some older windows laptops to sit behind the TVs as an option for teachers to sign into their domain account and access their OneDrive/Office etc.\n The part I'm needing some help with is some ideas about how to make this work. Each TV (laptop) could have 15+ users and storage would fast become an issue. Additionally, teachers can be in 10+ classrooms which makes it annoying to sign into OneDrive /Teams/Office initially on each room.\n Ideally I'd like to have them run as a thin client and remote into a server so storage isn't an issue, OneDrive/Office is logged in etc. I don't have any experience with this though.\n Thoughts on this situation?\n    submitted by    /u/Plane_Garbage  \n [link]   [comments]",

For various reasons I've got one workstation connected to two screens while my notebook gets one extra screen. Additionaly I've got a 65' UHD screen in here as well, for monitoring and the occasional meeting. Some other stuff with screen outputs on my desk as well, not connected permanently but only if needed.\n So as you can guess, things get messy quickly. I was thinking about getting something like this: https://www.purelink.de/en/switcher-matrices/hdmi/3431/4x4-4k-18gbps-hdmi-matrix-with-scaler-and-audio-matrix to switch between the screens because it leaves me with way more flexibility than any standard kvm switch I found, as those either don't come as a matrix switcher or don't do multi screen setups well. Then I might combine that with some kind of USB Switch.\n My question to you guys is, has anyone run something like this? Any recommendations for multi screen, multi PC setups? Happy to hear any thoughts on my setup, also very interested in how everyone else has their desk setup!\n    submitted by    /u/allnamesaretaken6  \n [link]   [comments]",

They ask us to return our equipment like laptop etc and also the ID office card which it doesnt make sense if its supposed to be a temporary lay off. Not to mention that they have closed our email accounts etc.\n So my question is how to handle this? Is there a way that we can still push back for compensation packages or something?\n I guess since they wont pay us anymore the only leverage that we have is not return the equipment and make a scene asking either for a proper lay off with compensation package and paid the untaken holidays or well a real temporary lay off where we keep the equipment till a new client comes?\n    submitted by    /u/Felix1178  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've recently labbed setting up a RDGW at home, so was quite pleased to get this. \n I set up CAPs & RAPs and AD Security Groups to point at them, added the PC and the user to the correct AD groups and then added him to the remote desktop users local group on his PC (I know I should do this via GP really, but wanted to get it sorted). Tested with an admin account and it worked. Sent the user a shortcut and it doesn't work.\n Spent several hours going crazy, checking and double checking what I'd set up. Relaxed the CAPs and RAPs to test. Compared it to other clients. Wondering what really obvious thing I've missed. At this point he's given me his AD password, so I test without the gateway from my PC using VPN. It works, but it's not a solution for him as he doesn't have the VPN.

Done the testing, all good, but I have 2 issues. First, I have to somehow \"sell\" this switch to the client (as in why this is better than the current setup) and what I'm thinking is 1. benefits of conditional access, 2. logs in only one place and 3. availability, if the radius server somehow goes offline it's bye bye ssl vpn for the users right now. Are there any other advantages that I could mention? \n Secondly, I have to find a way to do this as \"silent\" as I can so the users are not...bothered. I know I could do a step by step tutorial and let them modify the existing connection profile but this is not an option. Manually doing it myself remotely is also not an option, there are almost 400 users. What I tought about so far was Intune, but this would work only if I push the full Forticlient app, so it would be a reinstall/upgrade, it needs reboot and so on. Also, I thought about just pushing the configuration via gpo, but I have no idea if the Forticlient connection settings are stored in the registry, or in some file. Any better ideas here?\n Thank you! :)\n    submitted by    /u/SalamanderAccurate18  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am wondering if there is any kind of service or partnership known in IT that helps go through a company's support model and help with workflow, budgets, staffing, and basic day to day operations to find areas where we can improve.\n Our current IT department I feel is not utilized well, everyone wears multiple hats, everyone is on live phones, many processes don't have good documentation, or ticketing system and asset tracking is a mess, and I feel like we are spending way too much on services and tools we don't need. I am wondering about finding and suggesting an outside consulting company to our leadership that can take an unbiased look at how we are operating and our workflow and suggest how we can restructure to improve.\n It is very stressful at my job a lot of times because we don't have good structure in place, I feel every day I am just showing up and opening a mixed bag of whatever is a priority for that day and never having time to schedule or work on projects, aside from small pockets of time here and there to spend 30 minutes or so on something randomly during a week. It's a mess. But as much as I try to improve and document and organize what I am working on randomly over time, the department as a whole is pretty scrambled. If we had an expert consultant come on site and give some recommendations, I think it would be a good way to put us on track.\n    submitted by    /u/This_guy_works  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am very much holding the IT function together as even the Director has little to no interest as he is retiring.\n I have brought up at our annual reviews the lack of interest and enthusiasm from the Sys Admins I get told they are \"getting on\" so will struggle and I just need to accept that they will try what they can to make sure they are keeping with the times but that's down to the individuals. I feel like they are just letting them ride it out, and hopefully they will retire in the next 5 years or so.\n These Sys Admins are on £3-4k less than me per year.\n Do I hold out and take the opportunity while still having to do all the tasks/functions above or just start looking for a new position over the next few months?\n    submitted by    /u/i-do-IT-all  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I am looking for some suggestions on how do we better provision servers in our environment. I'll try to explain it as detailed as possible. \n For example, every admin in our environment creates a server differently in the sense that they dont see the correct settings etc, dont disable weak security encryption etc, its all build in a mess. I don't want to just create a document, but maybe use a tool which has maybe a VM template and can automate all of this. Will something like SCVMM do the job? Or is there something else? \n SCVMM came to mind because then it also comes with Orchestrator, which we can build to automate the user provisioning etc but again, this is just because i don't know other options.\n The more automation the better, of course not everything can be done in that way. Also we use Azure as well as hyper-v and Vmware. \n    submitted by    /u/browncookie30  \n [link]   [comments]",

This migration is a crucial step when adopting cloud computing services and is undertaken to take advantage of the benefits offered by the cloud, such as scalability, accessibility, cost efficiency, and improved data security.\n The data migration process typically involves the following steps:\n Assessment: Understand the structure and volume of the data you want to migrate.

But in the Missed, Outgoing and Received Calls lists it always shows the name of a former user C (Chris).\n The way we put the extension in place was we removed the old extension entry to set it up from scratch. Factory formated the phone (Mitel 5312) and now it still shows in those histories with the wrong name.\n There even is the same issue with just a contact of a phone directory entry. We give some people a company mobile phone and one of those phones changed hands to a new person (Jane Goodall). So when that person calls it always displays the name of the former user (Sandra Bullock). The only place I know where to look for is under \"Users and Devices\" > \"Telephone Directory Management\" > \"Telephone Directory\".\n There is no more entry even remotely having the former user's name and it somehow still stays in the system. Does anyone have an idea on this?\n Edit:\n No personal entries were created on any of the affected phones\n    submitted by    /u/VarmintLP  \n [link]   [comments]",

I realised this job can't be for the long term because of the pay and left it at that.\n At 18, I worked for a telecommunication company and acquired coax & fiber knowledge alongside basic networking.\n At 19 I became a network administrator and did a bootcamp(although I did more basic helpdesk duties and network technician duties).\n Now I'm 21 and I'm leading that network administrators team(which infact does helpdesk and technician duties), I deal with onboarding/offboarding people from my company and configuring Cisco devices, IT documentation, some virtualization with VMware as well with some other physical network stuff.\n I have a homelab which has a hybrid Active directory environment mixed with azure. \n I hold comptia a+, Microsoft az-900, az-104 and I'm close to comptia network+.\n The problem:\n From a lot of people, I hear system administration is dying, it's either moving to the cloud or getting automated so demand is decreasing.\n What can my options be? I feel that in this field it's so hard to find a path, as it expands so much\n Become a Sys admin? Focus on cloud administration? DevOps? Microsoft specialist(if that's even a thing)?

I'm currently working as a Tier-2 helpdesk technician for a call center, which primarily comprises a remote workforce. Recently, we have been transitioning some of our users from traditional workstations to Azure CloudPC.\n Prior to this migration, our employees were using Cisco AnyConnect as their VPN solution. However, we were encountering persistent issues with call drops, primarily due to the users' connections. With the Azure CloudPC, we've seen a significant reduction in the number of dropped calls.\n Despite this improvement, we're now experiencing a new problem: there's been a noticeable audio delay reported by the users who've been migrated.\n While searching for solutions, I came across this, which introduces a concept of multimedia redirection: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/multimedia-redirection-intro\n I'm wondering if anyone here has encountered similar issues or can provide insights into whether this multimedia redirection could serve as an effective remedy to our audio delay problem. We use Five9 contact center software. Any advice or experience you could share would be greatly appreciated. I’m just sick of all these tickets coming in. \n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/escobartracy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only IT employee for the past 15 years was a guy 60+ and promoted to \"Manager\" to onboard me and one other, less technical, new hire.\n He gets confused a lot. Admits he feels confused/incoherent sometimes. Takes a lot of days off. Tells us he's in and out of the doctor's offices multiple times a week. Expresses his interest in just sitting back and taking it easy now to let us take over.\n Unfortunately I've also found tons of issues across the system, including the fact that our product we sell to customers is just not very good. Customers are unhappy, and I want to work at a place I am proud of. Our MS licensing is a mess and management doesn't seem interested in hearing my concerns on it.

I'm looking at Zoom and RingCentral, and am hoping to get some feedback on either of these companies with respect to their phone system products.\n Background: We currently use Zoom for our videoconferencing needs, as well as our online classroom education. We've been pretty happy with them, and I'm leaning that direction because training would be minimal. Ring has a slick presentation, and it looks like they'd be about 30% cheaper.\n What has been your experience with either of these platforms, and how well did you like the service provided by the company involved when there were technical or administrative (read: billing) issues?\n Thanks!\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Gedanken-mental  \n [link]   [comments]",

Running in a normal batch takes up 12% (1 of 8 cores, 100/8), there is plenty of power leftover.\n Powershell 7.3 introduces the -Parallel parameter for ForEach-Object, pretty useful and can massively speed things up. After some experimenting, I made some code that may be helpful to others.\n Note that this is for .7z files, installing the 7Zip4Powershell Module adds the command \"Expand-7Zip\".

I have a riser cage for my Proliant Gen10 dl360 1u server and I want to populate the x8 slot on it with a NVME drive card and a x16 slot with a Nvidia GPU such as RTX A4000.

At the heart of every data center lies the 19\" server rack – a silent workhorse that has evolved significantly over the years. In this article, we take a journey through time to explore the history and technological advancements that have shaped 19\" server racks into the indispensable components they are today.\n The Genesis of 19\" Server Racks\n Back in the day, data centers looked nothing like the sleek facilities we see today. Those massive mainframes occupied entire rooms, leaving little space for anything else. Can you imagine that? As the need for better organization and efficient data management arose, the ingenious concept of server racks was born in the 1970s. But wait, there's more! The 19\" width standard came into play, bringing order to the chaotic world of data centers and allowing different equipment to coexist peacefully in standardized enclosures.\n    submitted by    /u/Timik_Enclosure  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's one of the biggest buzzwords nowadays, but I feel like no one in my department has a full understanding of it, just the core concepts. Therefore, when they containerize something, they basically just create a docker container of it on some random VM, and that's it.\n That being said, when I do something, I like to do it right. Best practice. Learning about containerization is one thing, but getting familiar with setting up an entire infrastructure dedicated to containerization is what I'm aiming towards. What are the tools available to us, both open source and paid? Can I just set up a Portainer machine and run all of our containers there? We've looked into OpenShift but it's insanely expensive. What's a better alternative?\n When I start down these rabbit holes, I do so with a fiery motivation.

So of course we've already terminated the user and they're no longer in AD. If I try to create a new user with the same username of course the SID doesn't match so it can't authenticate to the database to do any owner operations or assign a new db_owner. Of course because we let the vendor manage their stuff in our network they didn't add my team as db_owner I can't do anything in the DB and they've lost the default DB creds which they never provided to us in the first place.\n If anybody has any ideas how I can get past this problem without having to rebuild the database for an existing production solution I would be eternally grateful.\n And if you work for a vendor: I'm not mad at you but push back against crap practices like this. If you manage a solution for your clients, in their network or yours, it's your responsibility to maintain appropriate access to data and resources. That means making sure you don't delete the only account which has access to those resources. Same goes for everyone, of course.\n [Edit] ok, not all vendors suck.

I've been researching two main overlays for this task - Netmaker and Tailscale - but I'm having difficulty deciding between them.\n Our setup involves hosting some products in GCP and running internal services on Dell servers. We have a mix of workstations with different operating systems, and our network is segregated into VLANs.\n Both Netmaker and Tailscale offer different advantages and disadvantages. Tailscale, being a userspace WireGuard, might have slower speeds, while Netmaker could require more deployment and maintenance effort. However, the choice between the two may also depend a bit on how far we want to take the zero trust approach. For instance, should communication between two servers internally go through this solution? Is having to manage the ACL settings in a JSON file a good or bad thing (infra as code)? \n If any of you have encountered a similar dilemma or have experience with either Netmaker or Tailscale, I'd greatly appreciate your insights.

          "description": "So, apparently, I am unable to copy/paste an email signature template with images into Outlook now. I swear I used to be able to, but not anymore.\n I can add the images manually without issue, or even copy/paste the image itself. But I can't copy a chuck of text AND an image and then paste into the signature field.\n To be clear, I made a template in Word. It had all the details required by HR and management. It also had several images. All the user needed to do was copy the block of text and images, then paste into the Outlook signature file and edit the details to be personally relevant. Simple. Now I only get the text and the placeholders for the images. Frustrating.\n Anyone have a viable workaround that is easy for technically challenged people to follow?\n    submitted by    /u/SysGuy13  \n [link]   [comments]",

I supervise a few help desk/techs even have to pickup some tickets and do some onsite visits usually. My manager has strictly forbidden me from teaching anyone how to do anything outside their current roles, meaning it’s just me for the company office. Manager does not have a background in IT so they can’t help with much.\n As the company grows I’m losing more of my free time which is irritating me as I want my two days off a week to spend time with my kids and relax. It’s also forcing my spouse to have to shorten hours that she can work which means we actually have less money than we did last year. Before anyone says get a babysitter, I’m not paying someone to watch my kids, I don’t believe I should have to.\n I make 50k a year doing my job and they won’t consider giving me a raise until fourth quarter 2024. I feel like this would just get worse if I moved on with a larger organization based on reading horror stories here and by talking to others in the field.\n I’m currently expected to work 50+ hours a week at this point and since I’m salary no OT for me. CEO firmly believes salary = availability is 24/7. I’ve tried ignoring emails and texts while off but I learned quickly it is not tolerated and treated with write ups. I’ve been told as well to just cash out PTO since I’m the only one that can do a lot of things. My manager says “You being absent for a period of time would be problematic”.\n I’m starting to feel like IT is for people who don’t have families or a life.

When rebooting, the system would hang on the blue backgound rebooting message but the circle of dots that usually appears above it was missing.

This means 100 GB RAM, 6 cores, etc. for every user. \n My question is about GPUs, as their tasks will also be moderately expensive on GPU ressources. Previously i had difficulties working with GPUs on a Proxmox Server and VMs. In my opinion Proxmox is not really made for piping through GPUs into VMs and i dont know if you can even split GPU ressources to multiple VMS. On the other hand Proxmox is low cost and i am already familiar with it but it does not seem like the best platform for this use case\n Which Virtualization platform or Operating System does make sense for this task? \n Would it make more sense to have dedicated GPUs for every VM or is it easy to split ressources?\n    submitted by    /u/DiscountCode1212  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone. \n I'm working for a small company with nine employees, which doesn't have that many requirements concerning hosting - a super-plain, no-frills, static site with medium traffic. For some reason, the hosting provider (a small local company) we've been using so far sent a notification that they're raising the price starting next month without any rational explanation. \n My employer isn't happy about that and asked me to look into another hosting service. He's one kind of miser that would rather hang himself than pay an extra $40 a month without a reasonable justification (I get panic attacks when I remember the circles of hell I went through to get a raise a few months back).\n For the last few days, I've been looking into all these Hosting Services Compared, trying to find something that would suit my boss's financial requirements and, at the same time, would provide quality service. While researching, it hit me that I could open my own company and make some extra cash each month. \n I know a couple of similar companies (with some I worked in the past) that work with the same hosting, and I imagine they also aren't happy with the price increase. I don't think that it would be hard convincing them to switch to my service. \n I talked with a fellow friend who works in a hosting company today. But instead of sharing any advice, he tried talking me out of this, saying that it'll be a pain in the ass and not worth even trying because it'll be hard to compete with the giants that have a ton of employees.\n I'd really appreciate it if someone here who runs or has owned a small hosting business could share their experience. I'm particularly interested in the potential income, pitfalls, and problems that may await me if I decide to go on with the idea. \n Thanks in advance for your help. \n    submitted by    /u/acutelycrab27  \n [link]   [comments]",

My IT manager has tasked me with federating our M365 with our Google Workspace accounts which is all fine and well. We have tested this functionality and our staff are succesfully signing into their M365 accounts with Google. However as a result of changing our auth to federation, our test staff are unable to sign into their laptops anymore. \n I have looked online and have not found any concrete evidence on if it is possible for staff to sign into their laptops (that are bound to Intune) with their Google accounts. Does anyone have expierence with this and know if it is possible or not? If it is, please could you share any resources you have on this. I did discover the Google Credential Provider for Windows (GCPW) during my investigation but have so far have had some strange inconsistencies with it where some of our tests users are able to use it and seeminly log into the enviroment but Intune has not behaved or they haven't been able to login at all. \n We may fully migrate our identity provider to AzureAD in the future however at this point in time, our small team of 3 people doesn't have capacity for this.

          "description": "Hi all. Due to life changes, I decided to leave a job at a nonprofit that I’ve greatly enjoyed both the job and the purpose of the organization. I’ve been there many years and was the sole IT person for about 100 people. \n We hired the only person who applied and he seemed underqualified but it could work. I planned my exit to work with him for a couple weeks and bring him up to speed. Something seemed off with him and I just realized today that it seems like he’s just going to use this gig to pad his resume. By itself wouldn’t be a huge concern but he’s planning some massive projects that will cost thousands of dollars that could otherwise be spent on the actual purpose of the org. Meanwhile he’s not considering some specific projects I’ve suggested that had been pushed back due to Covid and other restraints but certain outdated equipment is becoming a liability… just not a sexy project. \n One project is upgrading the network to 10g when we barely make a dent in our 200mbps internet bandwidth. He’s done no research with staff or historical network usage to justify any of these projects. Unfortunately, no one else in the org understands IT and I’m not sure anyone will question these frivolous upgrades. \n I’m debating whether or not I should bring this up with my former boss but I don’t want to get into a pissing match. I truly value the organization and the people there and it’s frustrating to see things going this route. \n My thought would be to bring up my concerns and coach on what questions to ask. Basically why do we need this upgrade? What problem does it solve? And what data to look for as a justification. \n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/Dougisnthere  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long story short, the place i work for needs me to install a program called VeriAdmin from a company called bioscrypt, that manages fingerprints stores in a fingerprint scanner from the same comapny. The only issue is that Bioscrypt doesnt exist anymore, and after calling the company that absorbed them, i was told that they dont have that software anymore. Checking online, and there are no downloads of this software either (i did find one called secureadmin by the same company but its not the same software sadly)\n Anyways, we have one windows 10 computer where that software is installed and works on, but its due to be retired next week. i've tried to transfer over all the files, including the .dll's and the registry keys from the working computer to a new one, but in the process of being transferred over to a flash drive, it immediatly loses some data, since the exe loses its icon and any information about it in properties. Despite this i try to run it on the new computer and it simply wont run either in compat mode, as administrator etc. \n I ran procmonitor on the computer where it works and on the newer one to see what could be missing, and apparently, right after trying to QueryNameInfo a DLL thats stored in system32, it fails on the new computer, because on the new computer right after it starts a registry key named \"windows error reporting\", while on the old one it just continues with opening the HKCU registry key. \n I checked the DLL and theyre the exact same, with the same permissions, and everything else the same. Im not sure that this is the exact issue with the software, maybe something happens after it runs that DLL that doesnt show up on procmonitor, but if anyone could help me figure this out i would be very grateful. here is a screenshot of the procmonitor logs and i show where it fails (the new pc is on the left, the old one on the right): https://imgur.com/a/pVhHaQC\n again if anyone can help i would greatly appreciate it! thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/SamPlantFan  \n [link]   [comments]",

Would also need to be able to set custom resolutions to each section\n Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, everything I've found so far can split the screen however it doesn't list them as separate screens within Windows display manager\n    submitted by    /u/Objective-Cucumber81  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently, we use our own servers for email, but we would like to transfer the domain to Microsoft. Additionally, for certain users, we are purchasing Microsoft 365 Apps for Business licenses, including Office apps, etc. We currently have 35 such users, but during the migration, we will need around 50 users immediately, and within a year, the number may exceed 100 as we expand into international markets (we already have open companies in Spain, Portugal, Austria, Poland, etc.).\n As the company is present in multiple markets, the plan is to have all admin.microsoft processes executed in the main company, while in foreign countries, there will be the option to only add/remove users with licenses.\n For optimal operation, we would require a plan similar to what Microsoft 365 Business Standard offers at €11.70 per license/month. I'm wondering if you have any other suggestions for optimizing the company's operations with this number of users?\n Additional questions:\n What is the management principle for \"aliases\" on Microsoft servers? Are aliases free?\n In the case of a business relationship, do they provide training for administrators, and do they offer technical support in case of any issues?\n Thank you for your assistance and looking forward to your responses.\n    submitted by    /u/42woba  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even when a temporary table is very small and can be processed exclusively in memory, PostgreSQL creates one or more files for each such table.

As a result we have : \n  \nA separate disk that has exactly one folder that holds 500K files at all times.\n Of these 500K files, 99% of the files are either empty or less than 16K in size.\n There is constant active creation and deletion of new files.\n Reliability is completely unimportant. At any time you can delete the entire contents of the disk and re-create an empty folder.\n  \nAt the moment we use ext4 file system. Even a simple reading of the list of files in a folder can take 1-2 seconds.

They are a design firm with 12 employees with ~1.3tb of used storage. This would be my first server replacement and would appreciate some feedback. The existing servers were installed by their previous IT vendor and i'm looking for some recommendations on how to go about this upgrade.\n Their current setup:\n  \nDomain Controller - Windows Server 2016 (planning to replace after the file server)\n Used for very basic AD functions and DNS. Pretty much just used for creating users and authenticating them to the domain, no complex policies or in depth configurations.\n File Server - Dell Optiplex, Windows 10, 8gb ram, single 4tb hard drive (NO raid /facepalm)\n  \nI am looking to replace both machines, starting with the file server. The budget is about $3,000 for each machine. Their are a design firm and use Revvit / Autocad, thus cloud solutions are not viable, they store the projects on the file server and access them in office, beyond that its a very simple setup.\n This is what i'm looking at for the file server:\n Dell PowerEdge R250 / T150 Tower\n  \nWindows Server Essential 2022\n Intel Xeon E-2334\n 16GB / 32GB RAM\n 2x 4TB enterprise SSD - Raid 1 for data\n 512GB SSD for OS\n 10GB network card\n  \nDoes this look ok? Are SSDs overkill for this? I'm thinking of purchasing the basic ram/HD options from Dell and purchasing upgraded ram & hard drives for the items listed above since Dells upgrade prices are pretty significant. I want to set them up for success and considering they are using a consumer Dell PC with Windows 10 for their file server, anything would be an upgrade to their current setup.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/----Questions----  \n [link]   [comments]",

We current have multiple DFS servers in different geographical offices that replicate using DFS-R and then we use a software called PeerLock to handle file locking within the replication groups. This has been pretty solid but our initiatives are to move to cloud-based services. Whether it's SharePoint, Azure File Services, Egnyte or something else, that's yet to be determined.\n Some other info - 100% Windows clients, having mobile app access would be a plus, but not a requirement. Whether mapped drive or sync client is fine, we will need our users to rework files since we have an Excel linking problem, sheets linking to sheets, to sheets, to sheets, back to original sheet, and more sheets. Total storage need would be 15 TB initially. We also have folder overrun so we would definitely run into length issues in a SharePoint.\n I'm wondering what folks have turned to as their next version of file services in distributed offices that is as cloud-first as possible and what issues, caveats, or reviews you have.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/koecerion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been tasked with overhauling our DHCP design which has survived several OS/hardware upgrades over the years, but has kept the same overall layout. Some quick background on the company:\n This is a medium sized company based out of City 1. City 1 has two offices A and B separated by about 20 miles with a dedicated fiber line between them. There's two other small sales offices in cities 2 and 3 with VPN connections to office A. Our setup is configured with two physical domain controllers both running split scope DHCP out of office A and B, some other physical servers are represented in both offices, but office A houses our virtual environment.

I know I know, living up to the stereotype. \n Been WFH since March 2020. I work for a huge company within the financial services industry. Having some frustrating/peculiar tech issues. \n TL,DR: Can't log into my work's system, nor several other sites, like Hulu, from my (secure) WiFi network at home. However, I CAN log into my work's system and Hulu when using my Mobile Hotspot. I had zero issues on Friday, no hiccups. When I went to try both sites yesterday, neither worked. I should (hopefully) be fine using my Hotspot for the day, but obviously I can't/don't want to be using my Hotspot indefinitely. There was a very brief power outage over the weekend in my house (IDK if it affected my whole town or neighborhood, or if it was just my house), but everything came back on within like ~30 seconds. I doubt that had anything to do with it, but IDK. \n Thoughts? Ideas? Recommendations? Any DIY troubleshooting I can try? I've submitted a support ticket for my work-side, but IDK how much they'll be able to help, since I'm technically still able to access their network from my HotSpot, i.e. I doubt they are the root cause of the issue.

Before I try to un-deploy I'm wanting to confirm that \"un-deploy\" will not remove my VNET it is attached to? As I believe this would result in VMs attached to the VNET needing to be re-deployed...\n My gut says no it won't, that would be stupid, but I've seen enough stupid decisions in deployment wizards in my time to want confirmation... :)\n I've looked into the deployment doc and as far as un-deploy goes it just mentions it will kick off a confirmation, but not what the process will actually remove. As I was not the one to deploy, and it was deployed in 2020, I'm not 100% sure whether it created the vNET or not. I can confirm the Enterprise app has \"owner\" permissions on it however.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Bill3318  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had a lot of issues in the past with it but when it works, it works. \n I borrowed a licence from an a friend but its a one time deal.\n Anyone have an idea how to do this cleanly?\n    submitted by    /u/init32  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m particularly interested in a web-accessible system where I can visualize server states (resources, alerts, services, containers, etc.), access them via the web interface using SSH, and add new servers either directly or by installing an agent on the server.\n Moreover, considering security is paramount in our field, I’d highly value any tools that offer two-factor authentication (2FA).\n I’ve explored solutions like Cockpit Project, Webmin/Virtualmin, Rancher,.. but none have all features. While these tools offer several of the features I mentioned, I’d love to hear what you all are using and if there’s something out there that might better align with my needs.\n Could you kindly share your recommendations, experiences, or even potential custom solutions you might have developed?

Currently, we do have some GPOs in place, such as password complexity and security policies. The disagreement lies in whether the domain GPO should govern workstation settings. I manually configure certain settings on the images, like disabling unnecessary programs and features, to minimize user errors.

          "description": "I've only been managing the network in our organization for a few years now, but a phrase I'm very quickly getting tired of is \"it's the network/Wi-Fi.\" Whenever I hear a vendor, colleague, or end user utter this, the odds are about 8/10 that it's never the case. I can appreciate how end users or even technicians without a good bit of knowledge in this area might reach that conclusion, but what baffles me is when knowledgable IT people come to this conclusion with absolutely no evidence or reason.\n A case in point would be a vendor I recently dealt with, they're very knowledgable in their area and probably have more years IT experience than I've been alive, but then it pivoted to that dreaded phrase. Through the course of troubleshooting, it became clear they had no idea how DHCP worked. Again, I understand how people can have specialized areas of knowledge, but how the fuck can you spend 3 decades supporting networked devices and have no idea how they receive IP addresses!?\n Even beyond that, so many trash apps immediately throw errors like \"There's a problem with your Wi-Fi\" when in reality, they are experiencing an outage. Sure, that might sound better to the end user, but it's completely wrong and sending them in the direction of troubleshooting something that's working perfectly fine. Are the devs really that lazy and incompetent that they can't try to ping some common external resources to determine that the network is functional? Or shit, at the very least add the word \"might\" in front of that rather than convey with absolute certainty that your shit app expertly diagnosed that your Wi-Fi is indeed broken.\n    submitted by    /u/vtvincent  \n [link]   [comments]",

But really, doesn't almost EVERYTHING involve technology now?\n So we've been having a lot of conversations about how and who should take on some of this stuff. I'm doing what I consider traditional IT stuff for them. Business wide systems. Laptops, servers, 365 and similar cloud services, basic support, etc. and I find myself saying this a lot... That isn't \"IT.\" Things like data analysis, or application development, or trainings, or web design.\n And it occurred to me this really depends on how you define IT. I've worked at places where IT is one giant department that handles everything even tangentially related to technology. They are usually bureaucratic behemoths that everyone hates to deal with, but to each their own. And I've worked at places that decentralize this more. The communications department might handle websites, the analytics staff would handle data work, app development department builds apps, and an internal IT department does what I basically do.\n Curious how ya'll personally think about this and what your experience at different jobs has been. Is your IT department the kitchen sink department? Or are there specialized departments that handle different things, and if so, what is the department called that consists of admins and business wide support?\n    submitted by    /u/Covert_Tyro  \n [link]   [comments]",

Make Google Workspace email\n 2. Assign it a permission level\n 3. Have it able to SSO to everything in the toolset via Keycloak and Caddy depending on permission level without needing to invite manually\n This should all be accessible via private VPN and for that I'm eyeballing Netmaker because wireguard go brrrr. \n As far as I can tell I can use a mix of Workspace, LDAP, Keycloak, and Caddy to achieve a setup like this that allows provisioning permissions easily and SSO and that's what I'm sitting on right now. \n Anyone got advice?

It's a 3-letter domain name, and by the time I took over IT in 2005, it was of course taken and they wanted some exorbitant amount of money for it so we didn't purchase it. Because it was so entrenched and I didn't have the expertise to rename our domain nor the money to get help to do that, we've kept it in place so all our devices are in that \"abc.com\" domain.

And to use a translated version of a Dutch saying: I can't see the forest through all the trees. (There are too much of them to lose overview).\n The one we choose mustn't break the bank to much, but other than that we are allowed to suggest any ticketing system we feel would suit our needs. However, from what I can tell, most of them offer the same services with the same quality and for comparable prices. So my question to you all is: Which ticketing system do you use and why should or shouldn't we go for that one? One requirement though, it must use/support AzureAD SSO.\n I'd love to go for a big one like Service-Now or Jira, but I think those options will be shot down due to pricing. For reference, we are ±200 employee commercial company with 5 people in IT (not all 5 do support, but they will get an operator account).\n Can't wait to read what you all are using.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/ohohrobinho  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don’t think that’s scalable unless you plan on buying multiple MFPs for departments. In the past I was using PinPoint Scan with Kyoceras which I really liked.\n The way I see it is I either implement the solution already in place, or make the call to be different with hopefully the other offices following suit.\n Now, I’m no printer guru so I would love to hear what you all use for printing/scanning to the cloud (OneDrive preferred).

I'm trying to sync a perforce project with a team in NZ and I'm based in the UK and no matter what connection I try I'm getting a hard sync limit of 2mbps up and down. I've tried two different PC's and two completely seperate internet connections with different providers.\n The port 1666 is forwarded. All firewall rules are set to allow P4V to access. I'm not recieving any network or connection errors, it's just insanely slow. Our sys admin gave me an IP for the US server and this has the same issue, hard limit of 2mbps. I've tried VPNs.\n My p4 info readout is instantaneous implying theres no issue with connecting to the server. Someone has tried using my account in NZ and it was fine so not an account issue.\n Unfortunately Perforce support still haven't replied after a week and our network admin based in NZ isn't too familiar with it but can't see what the issue could be on his side of things. So reaching out to alternative means. Will happily ping someone a tip if they help me fix this as it's really pushing my progress back on the project.\n Cheers!\n Edit: Running Windows 11. Workplace Ethernet connection and two different mobile hotspots have been tried. All yeild a hard sync cap of 2mbps. Zero issues with pulling file lists or connecting to the project in perforce. It's purely file transfer that is experiencing the latency. No Kaspersky\n    submitted by    /u/boxofrabbits  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've tried to find online what this means but no luck - any ideas? Is it the hours that the robot has been in use, or the hours the library has been doing backups (e.g. reading/writing to tape).

Seems to make total sense, and we don't have complex management requirements, and we're already licensed for it.\n Our current environment is pretty simple and 'traditional' - machines joined to a domain, a couple simple GPOs, and some third party patching and inventory apps. All Win10, but looking to move to Win11 later this year and next:\n I have a bunch of questions that I'm having a bit of a hard time nailing down and getting conflicting answers:\n  \nIf we enroll a PC, it looks like it still stays on the domain... At that point I guess we just... disable GPOs (and move them into InTune)? I presume InTune should become the single source of truth for management/policies? \n User Profiles - If we enroll a device and they're still joined to the domain - I presume they keep the existing user profile?\n A user gets a new PC (Win10 or 11) - Should it even be joined to the domain at that point? Is there any value add anymore?\n Virtually all of our apps are web apps - except for a traditional file share (Z: drive) - I know a non-domain machine can still connect to a file share (they would need to manually put in their creds)... Anything to be aware of here? (We want to get rid of this file share, most of our stuff is in sharepoint, but we still have a legacy LOB app requiring it for now - looking to get away from that next year).\n Servers - Can stay on the domain (and probably need to), but what are you all doing for management of servers (eg. patching)? I know Azure has autopatch and a few things, but that seems very... limited in behavior.\n  \nAnything else we should be aware of? Seems simple from a certain standpoint, but also completely different than what we've been used to doing for 25 years.\n    submitted by    /u/sysadmin99  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is a real simple thing that didn't require any complex routing or anything, it's basically a secondary guest Wi-Fi, right? No big deal.\n Some fuckknuckle logged into the centralized manager for all the firewalls and apparently clicked push to two of our primary manufacturing sites without paying any attention to what he was doing. This pushed two old configuration files to those sites which overwrote half of the SSIDs that were already in place and vital to our 24/7 manufacturing. You'd think this was easily fixable by rolling back to the previous nights stored config, right?\n These dumb cumstains…",

          "description": "Hi All,\n We have a customer running a product called Autodesk Vault on an AWS instance (Windows Server 2019). Recently they have been experiencing really poor performance on the software and we've been trying to get to the bottom of it. \n The software is file storage / BLOB vault with clients connecting to it via a IIS web application layer. The customer has about 3 users on the system so it's not a huge deployment and the vault database is about 150gb (140gb of BLOB and 10gb of database spread across ~ 15 MDF) \n  \nThe instance is idling most of the time on CPU ( <10% usage)\n It's using less than 40% available memory. I've checked SQL server and it's using about 1/4 of the available 1.4gb shared memory pool\n Network speed tests are very good (as you would expect from AWS)\n Disk activity doesn't appear very high but...\n  \nHaving checked everything with the developers, the problems seemed to be stemming from the database. We've upgraded the storage from \"gp2\" tier to gp3 and doubled the IOPS and throughput from 900 IOPS / ~250MB/s to 5000 IOPS / 500MB/s.\n Having done all this its running a bit better but not dramatically better. It's not clear though if it is the storage which is the bottleneck or if something else is going on.\n The server currently runs MS SQL Express 2019 but we're nowhere near hitting the memory pool limit and it doesn't appear like its getting thrashed. I just wondered though if there are any other limits/issues which could be causing this version of SQL Server to be causing problems? \n Does anyone know if upgrading to MS SQL Server Standard 2019 offers any performance benefits over Express for general SQL work loads?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Soup_Roll  \n [link]   [comments]",

The nodes ended up in an unusable state everytime because \"the batch agent extension provisioning has failed on compute node\". I also didnt see the vms being allocated inside any of my subnets, so then I explicitly created it in one of my snets. I did see them allocated in that subnet, but the 'unusable' result was the same. I have no private endpoint for the vms, and the policy of my organization does not allow opening the RDP port publicly, so I cant use RDP to test anything in the vnet. But before configuring the batch to be created in the subnet, I connected to the vm and it seemed like nslookup did find the DNS of the storage account for the batch. However, the resource files are not being downloaded to the VMs from the storage account. The NSGs are already configured and the ports should be fine.

I recently had to unbox and install an HP Printer/Scanner in a controlled environment for work without an internet connection and you would think I was disarming a bomb. I unboxed the Printer, added paper to the tray, closed it and plugged it in. And immediately the printer began printing NONSTOP. Eh you know 5 years in IT and nothing really surprises me like this… it’s definitely the first time I’ve seen something like this. I read the entire manual included.

If you've ever had to shuffle mDNS traffic (discovery of printers, chromecast, airplay devices, ...) between VLANs, this is for you. The go to solution on the internet is installing Avahi on a linux VM somewhere and turn on \"enable-reflector\" to make it rebroadcast mDNS traffic received on one interface to other interfaces. But it's a kludge, you need a linux VM to start with and then for every VLAN you need an interface inside that VM...\n But Cisco routers & switches can do this on their own, here's a simple configuration with 3 VLANs:\n ! service-list mdns-sd PERMIT-ALL permit 10 match message-type any ! service-routing mdns-sd ! interface Vlan3 ip address 10.1.3.1 255.255.255…",

Not a big problem i thought as i run the setup i came across another BIG problem. After selecting 1 for changing the cert the setup asks you to put into your pw for \"administrator@vsphere.local\" and yea we lost that somehow.\n Okay next step trying to reset the \"administrator@vsphere.local\" user acc. I used the \"vdcadmintool\" tool tot reset the pw. Which worked BUT when i try to log into the acc via the webinterface i always get \"wrong username or pw\" so as it now stands i cant login with my user due to the cert problem and when i try to change the cert i cant login into the local admin.\n Have any of you ever experienced such problem? Which pisses me of the most is that resetting the \"administrator@vsphere.local\" account gives me a pw but that just doesnt work.\n Oh we are using vSphere 6.7\n So googeling a few yours brought me nothing so now my hope is with you guys.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Blooddragoo  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have a small Meraki network and have a student SSID as well as a teacher SSID, the SSIDs are the same, but the passwords differ by school building. Teachers have been prone to writing their SSID password down on whiteboards and pieces of paper and leaving it where kids are able to see it and make use of it. \n We're looking to find a way to prevent them from being able to do that, and an early idea is trying to bake the password into the SSID so they never get their hands on it. I was thinking of a splash page for teachers that would require them to sign in with their full credentials once and then be all set, but I think I might need all their credentials in advance which would be likely fraught with potential issues.

I’m still only 4 years into my career, but I spent the first three really grinding and studying hard. Now I’m more concerned with just enjoying my life, even if it’s on a lower income. \n This isn’t really a question.

Okay, management \"found\" this \"new\" packaging format, called Snaps, and asked me to investigate, if it would be good for our company to use.\n I never was a huge fan of Ubuntu and Snaps in general, but now, when I dug deeper into it, I'm stunned. Really, it looks like Ubuntu doesn't give a single F about Snaps, allowing them to rot and become unusable.\n Two quick examples, that are ESSENTIAL in app development:\n  \nDocker - published by Canonical, latest version in snaps is 20.10.24, released April 4th, in Docker APT repo we have 24.0 already, two versions ahead\n Jenkins - published by Snapcrafters (star developer, responsible for example for Gimp, Discord, Android Studio, Sublime), in Snaps latest stable version is 2.290, released IN APRIL OF 2021!\n  \nWeren't Snaps supposed to be a way for developers to publish official packages, up to date and self-contained? A way to install latest version of software even on older distro release? \n In my humble opinion, it's just harmful. If Canonical is going to push Snaps down our throats, delete APT versions in favour of Snaps, shouldn't they make absolutely sure, we are getting up-to-date and supported versions of software? Especially, since they advertise Snaps as a great way to install production-ready, stable and up-to-date packages in enterprise environment?\n    submitted by    /u/IamJuras  \n [link]   [comments]",

IT Support job has an IT Team with someone to supervise the line work but the IT Admin job has no such guidance so i would he completely on my own. Although, the work lifestyle in the IT Administrator job looks very laid back while the IT Support role looks pretty daunting. I suppose that would be due to how big the business is. Overall my skills in IT is on par with IT Support level 3 and my IT Administrator skill set is rather lacking but the person who wanted to hire in me in the IT Admin role told me he feels that i will be able to do good things and learn in the company. Im just looking for a sign as to which to go for or a bit of convincing. Kindly help me\n    submitted by    /u/DeathToKarl  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have the e5 license for all devices. \n Tried both windows 10 enterprise iso and pro iso 22h2 and even windows 11 22h2 pro,with the same issue. \n It's having a weird behaviour every time i reinstall/and enroll it to the domain.\n Most often there is a process called vmemm taking up upwards of 1.5 gb of memory.\n Another is when Microsoft application guard goes upto 90% and fails and loops edge opening. On some resets this is fixed.\n This issue happens on all domain join after reset. after awhile the whole desktop freezes up, like not being able to click on the taskbar or desktop icons, but if I press the win key it fixes this desktop and task bar. But issue appears again.\n Our usual laptop enrollment goes like: * reset * change name, restart * create admin account * run a basic Ps script that disables few functions) * enroll to domain using user account * switch user \n Keep resetting it because I can't seem to leave the domain either. When I try to leave and provide the password it says its incorrect.\n The laptops work fine before domain join. I tried enrolling another old lenovo laptop, it's able to join, leave and reset with no issues whatsoever.\n On Monday I'm gonna try an older iso like 20h2 and update it to the latest version instead.\n Any thoughts will be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/RadiantSkiesJoy  \n [link]   [comments]",

My CS colleague and I were arguing about when to do it. I would much better prefer to wait until all our 10 used add-on are tested then updated (that may or may not take a while) while he would test and get rid of the un-updated add-on or if not possible use another soft which have the feature we need without needing to use third party add-on which are prone to not get updated as often. We are pretty early in our deployment so it still make more or less sense to change software. \n I get his point which is that it's absolutely terrible not to correct a known cybersecurity risk for some feature but these feature are all needed for our use case and I know that updating when using multiples add-on can get messy quickly. We didn't setup a test environment yet, we plan to set it up as fast as possible to see if these feature do break. What seems clear to me is that the same issue will arise for each of our app later down the road. \n How do you guys tackle updating software in your company especially when certains third party features might break, do you simply get rid of it ? Do you develop yourself these features so that maintaining it is less an issue ?

Create a dynamic group using tags or resource group and attach a maintenance schedule to this group?

I have been guilty of it myself, but no more. I promise from now on to stop and think before I fire off an angry reply. The sysadmin on the other end of the comment may have a totally different perspective on the issue, but they are still my brother or sister in arms.\n Thanks for reading.\n TLDR: Be nice, your department's budget doesn't define your worth as a SysAdmin.\n    submitted by    /u/IntentionalTexan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I'm working up DR/BC plans, and wondering how to approach this scenario. I've heard of a company's entire Azure tenant getting corrupted, or somehow becoming inaccessible for a long time. We've got a hybrid AD, in an Azure VM-Windows Server. We keep files in a server share, as well as in like 50 different Teams/SP libraries. \n I back up our server shares externally to an AWS bucket, in addition to Azure's built-in backup. I run test file restores once a month. We use Afi to backup mailboxes, Onedrives and Teams/Libraries. But the only backups of our AD are stored in Azure's backup; I've never tried to restore it. \n Should we consider what happens if our whole Azure/MS365 tenant goes sour? Do companies keep an alternate domain? Testing the viability of restoring AD and Teams to it? Should we have a plan in case Microsoft goes south altogether? \n Also, we're supposed to do vulnerability scans and network penetration testing, for our insurance policy. Should I be outsourcing DR planning and testing, along with scanning and pen testing? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/NotNotMyself  \n [link]   [comments]",

After deploying a couple of VMs, I noticed that on all pre-existing servers the Windows Firewall is disabled, while I leave it enabled and only open the minimum required ports/protocols. When I asked about the reasoning behind this I got an answer which basically comes down to:\n - It can easily be bypassed by hackers so it's not that useful\n - In a full Windows environment you need so many ports open that you might as well disable it\n - We have a good datacenter firewall (servers are segregated and firewalled in different vlans: mgmt, web, SAP, etc)\n - We don't have the time/staff to figure out the required ports for all servers, and even for new servers it needs to be configured, documented, etc. \n It felt a bit awkward to react to because I don't want to come across as an asshole-know-it-all right from the start, but I tried to explain my opinion that I don't see it as a magic solution for everything but just an additional layer in the entire security picture. In the end the conclusion was that we keep it disabled to keep it consistent with all the existing servers. Which is fine I guess, it's not what I would do, but it's not my call. To me it just seems weird and contradictory for a security engineer to have this kind of opinion, but at the same time the guy does have a lot of experience, so... Am I crazy?

Just wondering what everyone recommends for SQL server best practice with performance as a primary consideration?\n We have an application that uses SQL server as the backend database, and performance has been pretty crummy since implementation. \n We're replatforming the environment and I want to take best practices into consideration during the environment refresh. From what I've gathered here are some of the changes we'll be making:\n  \nSeparate application server and SQL server to be two separate VMs so SQL server is not fighting the application services for resources\n Create seperate virtual disks for C drive, DB drive, and logs drive (currently everything is just installed under C drive)\n Configure memory allocation settings to equal or greater value of the sum of all of your DB files if possible (it is doable in our env) -- From my understanding with manipulates the SQL server to favor logical reads vs. physical reads?\n  \nAny other recommendations? Any that I've listed above that are unnecessary/outdated? When setting memory do you set a minimum memory value or leave it at default? Right now our SQL instance max memory is set to 2147483647, should I leave that or set it explicitly to >= to the sum of DB files or does it not matter? When considering storage, we have an all flash Nimble SAN, should I be specifying any settings on the LUN for optimal performance or are those recommendations obsolete with the use of NVMe flash? Any maintenance tasks that can help optimize performance? And lastly, how do I validate that these changes have improved anything?

Settings that no matter the user or computer, must have as part of the mandatory configuration baseline. These are almost all security-relevant settings. Any settings that would deviate from this \"universal truth\" is broken into a separate user/computer policy and applied as/where needed.

Basically, I'm curating (for now) CISA advisories and adding a security test (scale-ready TTP) to validate that you're devices, if relevant, are protected.\n The first publicly promoted one (there are others avail) is for #CL0p Ransomware + exploitation of MOVEit Vulnerability CVE-2023-34362.\n This tests whether a host is vulnerable to CVE-2023-34362 and attempts to execute techniques associated with Cl0p Ransomware Gang, which is actively exploiting this vulnerability. There is a .go source code file available if you decide you want to see whats running on the endpoint. \n Note: this test utilizes basic port and version verification scanning to identify if an endpoint is vulnerable and does not modify the endpoint in any way. Command execution does not attempt to modify the system in any harmful way.\n Here are the actual steps of the test:\n  \nGet the external IP of the endpoint.\n Exit PROTECTED if unable to determine external IP and continue if not.\n Execute a version check for the applicable MOVEit Transfer version.\n Exit PROTECTED if applicable MOVEit Transfer version is not found and continue if not.\n Execute ingress tool transfer by dropping a pseudo malicious DLL containing Cl0p artifacts to disk.\n Execute a file write containing Cl0p-specific ransom note verbiage to disk.\n Exit PROTECTED if the test is stopped. UNPROTECTED if not.\n  \nGive it a shot. Let me know what you think: https://www.preludesecurity.com/advisories/aa23-158a\n David\n    submitted by    /u/DH_Prelude  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all. So ive hit a bit of wall with this issue we have been having at our office which I could really use some guidance on. Our office is surrounded on most sides by another training provider who seems to think that any and every room they move into needs around 2/3 AP's. We are having issues where their AP's seem to do a channel scan every 30 minutes or so and change their channels around which causes all our AP's to hit 100% interference and connections drop off (We are using Unifi AP's and Controller). On a normal day 2.4Ghz is 100% taken over with their 4 SSID's overlapping themselves and the 5Ghz band is around 80% used up. We have tried to speak to them however they have said that it isn't their problem and suggested we just boost the signal of ours (we tried that for the sake of it but it just ended in more interference) or move all our devices over to 5Ghz which we currently have set to do if the device supports it. We have plenty of AP signal strength to cover the office for both 2.4 and 5Ghz.\n We've wired everyone we can in but the top dogs at the company come in and demand that their teams calls must not drop for even a second while on wifi. Have any of you guys had this kind of issue and how was it resolved/dealt with as me telling and showing them the graphs and stats seem to fall on deaf ears. To add to all this we have also had the students and staff from the other company complain to us because every 30 minutes they all lose connection (which when i suggested they might want to check that setting they ignored).\n    submitted by    /u/matstar862  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR: How does Windows identify known networks?\n ​\n I use Microsoft Always-On VPN, and it uses trusted network detection to determine if it's on or off-prem. Sounds good. It's supposed to use the DNS suffix issued by the DHCP to determine that. Except, it doesn't... It seems to actually use the \"friendly name\" of the network, and therein lies the problem.\n ​\n My internal dns suffix is ad.company.com. I also have wireless for corp-owned devices, which hands out the same suffix. So, random users' laptops may create new known networks with names like \"Corp Wifi 2\" or \"ad.company.com 5\" and can use them interchangeably regardless of whether the device is hardwired or on wireless. Since AOVPN seems to want to use the friendly names instead of the dns suffix like the MS docs say it uses, clients will randomly decide that they're off-prem and connect to the VPN server when they're on-prem breaking any access to internal resources. My temporary workaround has been to blackhole any connections to the VPN server from within the network, but that's causing other weird issues and delays in accessing network resources, though it ultimately does work.\n ​\n But you say, \"just use GPO to create a network profile so the name doesn't change!\" I'm sure you're absolutely correct, but when I'm creating the GPO, it appears to only let me select existing known networks on my computer, and it seems that I too have had those weird incremented network names in the past.\n ​\n Ultimately, my question is, how in the world is Windows fingerprinting the network, and why is it thinking the exact same network is a different one? Looking in the Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\NetworkList\\Profiles\\ registry hive where that info seems to live, I don't see anything like DNS suffixes, subnets, or anything other information that would be used to uniquely identify my corporate network.\n    submitted by    /u/smalltimesysadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Chats. Channels. Mentions. Everything), and \"nudges\" you to be more production/healthier/various other things - all things HR wants to push.\n The trouble is, it has some requirements which wave massive red flags at me from a security perspective - quite ignoring the \"listens to everything\" aspect, which is way, way too big brother for my liking.\n Some include\n  \nUses OATH to access Azure for AD mappings, and wants access to everything - the entire AD detail of every user in Azure - names, phones, group memberships o- you name it.\n ridiculously high security permissions in Microsoft365 - including, but not limited to, reading the user profile, reading and writing all chat messages, reading all mail in all mailboxes the user has access to, and other levels which simply boggle my mind.\n No indication of where data is stored (we are a multinational company with staff all over the world, including in GDPR covered locations)\n Infinite time data storage unless specifically instructed by the company to delete it\n  \nThere's a lot more issues jumping out, but those are the biggies.\n So - has anyone here actually implemented this thing anywhere? Have any experiences - good or bad - from a security/administration perspective to relate? I can't find any genuine reviews online from any source I actually trust to be objective - I'll take anything anyone knows onboard.\n I realise this may be a little obtuse for anyone here to have actually come across it, and if it gets me nothing, at least I tried.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/HeadacheCentral  \n [link]   [comments]",

I guess the times changed , and we were a classic computer pool for long time..\n For like 20 years we bought like everytime Dell Optiplex SFF (SmallFormfactor) with midrange Dell Monitors. We buy stuff on like 5 year rollation every half oft , so this year we gonna find a followup configuration to really 10 year old PCs (Optiplex 3020 , sff, Celeron, 4gb RAM , 400 GBHDD)\n So far we are like to about buy a Optiplex 3050 ssf, I3-12100 as standard with 8GB and 256 nvme, which is enough. Monitorwise a 24 Inch Dell is intented.\n But since Corona the students put money in their equipment and so there are many more laptops which have thunderbolt or USB-C PD\n so we are planning to buy decent and good monitors/screens with integrated KVM / LAN (LAN is important because in the rooms there is no sufficient WIFI, we will use eduroam 802.1X for connections)\n recently i tried those Configurations* Dell P2723QE mit USB-C Hub (fi this review : https://www.pcworld.com/article/630195/630195.html)* Fujitsu Fujitsu P2711 TS QHD mit USB-C (https://www.fujitsu.com/de/products/computing/peripheral/displays/p2711-ts-qhd/)\n with both USB-C PD (Powerdelievery works fine)with both Screen is connected properly\n ... we tried like 5 Devices on it, just to get a feelingt..\n no Problems so far, unless sometimes there seems to be some freezes in LAN , one Windows 11 Device connected to usb-C also lost totally the LAN connection. Strange but it seems like Realtek Network 8153 related Problems which occur sometimes on specific situations.\n ​\n Questions to you:\n Do you guys have any suggestions on good other KVM Integrated Screens? Which is your favorite?\n Do you guys have other Ideas towards my plan. First I tended to buy USB-C Docks, but now I think integrated is way better!\n    submitted by    /u/Trick-Rip3361  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, \n In our current situation we have a large portion of our infrastructure being managed by the IT department of our parent company. Everything down to the ESXI hosts are their responsibility, while the virtual servers of our factories are our own responsibility. This works reasonably well, although I wouldn't mind having my own team doing the managing like I am used to at other jobs (lets just say we have had our issues with the IT department, like them running WEP SSID's till end 2022). \n Anyway, when we run a project we request a new virtual server, they deploy one via a template and we get on our way. We use their KMS server to activate our Windows products and occasionally when there is Office on the server installed to activate that too. \n Now we run into the situation that we are most likely being sold. The IT manager of our parent company informed us today that they do not want to assist with creating new servers (requested 10 more) because when moving to the new owner they expect us to create new servers with them and moving the application and data over, and not move the virtual servers itself. \n The servers run in our own domain separate from the parent company, meaning they have no cached administrative credentials or anything like that saved on our VMs that could potentially leak. Their reasoning for migrating applications + data rather than the VM itself is because of Windows licensing. But from my limited experience with KMS a Windows server will contact the KMS to renew their activation every X months. Surely we could simply release the current licenses being assigned to our servers via KMS, switch over to the KMS of the new owner and bobs your uncle? \n Or does KMS licensing work differently? \n Any insight would be appreciated! \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Dennis-sysadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

This would not normally be allowed, but hey ho. \n The mitigation i am putting in place are these : \n Firewall rule to only allow a connection from the static local IP of his device on the RDP port\n Preventing drive mapping.\n Preventing Clipboard. \n To achieve this it appears a local group policy can be created. This policy then changes the following keys: \n HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server - DisableDriveRedirection = 1\n HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Terminal Services - fDisableCdm =1\n HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server - DisableClipboardRedirection = 1\n HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Terminal Services - fDisableClip = 1 \n I have enabled all of these however I'm still able to connect with local drives mounted from the off domain device to the on domain device, aswell as access the data on them. \n The goal is to prevent file transfer and copy + paste. \n I may be missing something really obvious. I'm deploying the reg keys via intune, I'm aiming to avoid local GP so that if the user changes device or moves to a new one the settings are deployed down. \n Thanks all in advice, Sorry if this is a really obvious solution, It may be a case of getting in too deep and not being able to see the trees from the woods. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/emile1920  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is critical to their operations and gets the highest priority. Customer said “When I press the power button, the server doesn’t turn on like everything else”\n I built this server personally using a Dell Poweredge R710, Perc H310 in HBA mode. \n Fortunately I have spares, I took the staging server were were going to use to deploy an exchange upgrade and brought it with me.\n Went on-site, the power supply LED’s were on, pressed the power button and, nothing, pressed the blue light indicator and nothing, must be a bad motherboard. Since it would be much easier and faster to move the HBA and hard drives to the other server then it would be to replace the motherboard, that’s what I did.\n I didn’t move the processors or the RAM. The replacement server has 32GB of RAM and faster processors, so that’s fine (more than overkill) for a NAS.\n After the swap I reconfigured the BIOS, and the server came right up, added the Static IP and bingo, everything is back online, total time from initial call to completed server replacement 3 hours. \n I’m feeling pretty great right now. Customer was off today, the end users won’t even know what happened.\n This is how smooth a “disaster” should be.

These servers need to connect to the internet so you can use them, I make sure these connections all work fast and for 1000s of devices”\n Really the launching point of this question is someone in my family equated data center with warehouse which made them think I was basically moving around boxes. This prompted them to ask if I was a manager or warehouse manager and when I said no they said that our other relative could put a good word in at the candy factory they work at that I should consider it. \n I understand not knowing the ins and outs of a job because most people don’t know that for most jobs but to not even have a high level concept of it was a bit mind boggling especially since they equated it to something very random. \n So how does everyone else explain what they do to non-tech/IT/etc folks and more importantly do people actually understand at all?\n    submitted by    /u/bender_the_offender0  \n [link]   [comments]",

Looking back at the same report for May we can see these started on 14th May. Normal daily inbound email values for us are around 10,000 and we can see these hitting 100,000+ through this period.\n Having dug into the rejections deeper using the info within Reporting -> CSV in the Mimecast portal it reads like a DDoS attack with multiple source IP addresses and randomised FROM addresses. The TO addresses are also randomised, so it doesn’t seem like a targeted attack from that point of view.\n Our main concern is that the TO domains extend to all our domains within both our Mimecast and 365 tenant, some of which are not in the wild as such and would normally see very few inbound emails. It’s as though someone had a complete list of our domains and sent high amounts of email to randomised addresses in a DoS attempt.

I was wondering if any of you could lend me a hand or provide some guidance.\n Specifically, I'm looking for a dataset that consists of payload-based HTTP traffic, classified as either malicious or not malicious. While I have come across datasets that focus on URL-based data, my research specifically requires payload data. If anyone knows of any existing datasets that fit this criterion, I would greatly appreciate any information or links you can provide.\n Alternatively, if there isn't a readily available dataset, I would be more than willing to create my own dataset by classifying payload data myself. If any of you have access to a collection of payload data or any logs or know of any resources where I could find such data, I would be extremely grateful. I couldn't find it on Kaggle.\n Thank you in advance for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from this knowledgeable community!\n    submitted by    /u/CyberTrauma_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All,\n We are looking at changing legacy HDDs on our campus systems for above 1,000 Windows systems to an SSD or NVMe drive as their primary drive. The systems currently have individual data of each of our organization members' company user profiles along with maybe secondary HDDs of sizes varying from 500GB-2TB. We would only expect to move the primary drive which is usually no more than 1TB in size, average is 500GB.\n As this will be a large task for our small team to migrate the data from the existing drive to a new drive-through normal (home user) imaging tools the work is expected to take a few weeks or months to complete for all 1000 systems. \n A few considerations we are still uncertain on:\n  \nIf any suggestions on professional imaging tools are there for moving the content from the old (HDD) physical drive to the new (SSD) drive that can give us a rollout of maybe 100 systems per day over network backup/restore imaging methods then we can consider this. Have any approached something like this procedure before?\n If we are buying the SSDs in bulk as all the same model and capacity, we should not expect much fuss from Windows OS in the hardware imaging process as no other components (like motherboard, GPU, etc.) are being changed right?\n Should we expect potential data loss from bad sectors in existing HDDs being cloned to SSDs, maybe OS blue screen errors as the data might not be perfect in the old HDD?\n Any other precautions we should expect if we plan to do this in-house?\n  \nWe are considering outsourcing this task to a vendor for fixed SLAs and agreements and having our users up and running in a known timeline with the least amount of downtime. I am not sure whether they will have data loss in their contract.\n Let me know what you think is the best approach here.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Klipspringer112  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few weeks ago we started getting reports of certain computers not waking up properly. Upon investigating, my techs found that the computers (Optiplex 7090 micros) would be normal sleep mode, and moving the mouse caused the power light to go solid and the fan to spin up, then... nothing. We got about 10 reports of this, out of a fleet of at least 50 of that model among our branch offices.\n There had been a recent BIOS update, so we tried rolling it back. That seemed to help for one or two boots, then back to the original problem. We pulled one of the computers, gave the employee a loaner, and started a deeper investigation. \n So many tests. Every power setting in Windows and BIOS. Windows 10 vs Windows 11, M.2 Drives vs SATA, RST vs AHCI, rolling back recent updates... The whiteboard filled up with things we tried. Certain things would seem to work, then the computer would adapt like Borg to a phaser and the wake issue would recur.\n After a clean Windows install, one of my techs noticed that it seemed to only happened when the computer was joined to the domain. We checked into that, and sure enough, that was the case. Ok, a weird policy issue, finally getting somewhere. There was only one policy dealing with power, so we disabled that. No change.\n Finally, we created an Isolation Ward OU, and started adding GPOs one by one. Finally one seemed to be causing the wake issue... but it made no sense. It was a policy that ran a script on shutdown, that logged information to the Description field in Windows- Computer name, serial number, things like that. No power policies, it didn't even run on wake.\n We tested it thoroughly, and it seems definitive: A shutdown policy, that runs a script to log a few lines of system information, was causing a wake from sleep issue, but only on a subset of a specific model of a computer.\n My head hurts.\n    submitted by    /u/JasonMaggini  \n [link]   [comments]",

This helps in implementing stricter security policies and access controls. Even if the server firewall is compromised, an attacker would still need to bypass additional security measures to gain access to the workstations' network.\n Reduced Attack Surface: Placing servers and workstations on separate VLANs limits the exposure of critical server resources to potential threats originating from workstations. It minimizes the attack surface, reducing the chances of unauthorized access, data breaches, or lateral movement within the network.\n Performance Optimization: Servers often require more bandwidth and have different traffic patterns compared to workstations. By segregating them on separate VLANs, you can prioritize and optimize network resources for server traffic, ensuring efficient communication and reducing the risk of congestion caused by workstation-related traffic.\n  \nNow thinking of the extra complexity layer added by the above setup. Implementing Inter-VLAN Routing, to allow for controlled communication between VLANs. By selectively permitting specific traffic between VLANs, you can ensure that essential services, such as DNS, DHCP, domain authentication, print queues, and file shares, remain accessible to workstations but this might be a long trial and error process\n Your thoughts? \n    submitted by    /u/_ReeX_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or do I need to go back to \"AD Sites and Services\" and do something there to get it to update DNS correctly? \n    submitted by    /u/jwckauman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n Just after a bit of insight into how the company you work for offers training to its IT staff?\n I work for a large company in a 3rd Line role and have been with them for around 5 years. In that time I cannot remember any meaningful training that's been offered to me either individually or as a team and its incredibly frustrating. We get the standard corporate crap like heavy lifting, gdpr, modern slavery, etc etc but no training for our roles.\n As an example, we've recently moved over to azure and although I have quite a lot of access within it, I have received zero training on it from the business. The access for the team gets less as you go down the levels e.g. 1st line and 2nd line have restricted access and can only do certain things like add someone to a group.\n We have a knowledge base but I wouldn't say it's the best - we do try to keep it up to date though as much as possible. \n What does your company offer you? If anything? Or do you just learn in your own time? \n I'm interested to find out if anybody has time set aside for them to train e.g. Comptia courses, azure fundamentals - stuff like that. \n I find I have to use my own time to train which I don't think I should be doing.\n    submitted by    /u/VanDran85  \n [link]   [comments]",

As I've always learn by doing, I hardly have certificate/certifcations under my belt to show for what I can do.\n What I can do: recently got CCNA, CCNP is well within reason. LPIC-1 is probably low hanging fruit too, might strive for LPIC-2. Most recent dabbling with python & powershell. Not a front end guy, but back end, bring it on.\n So, I'm going to hunker down and get certs to try and get myself another position. The way I see it, I can either go into product customer support, which would somewhat limit myself to my employer's products, but that can be lucrative. Or go into DevOps/SRE/Data Analyst.\n Any advice on which to focus on, or something else I'm not aware of, and the path to it, that'll be great. WFH is definitely a must for me, as I planned to WFH and move some place with lower cost of living before my current job which doesn't allow WFH.

First time posting here, I hope it’s not a duplicate.\n I’ve been desperately trying to figure out a solution to this issue that was assigned to me by my senior team member, thus leading me here.\n We have two Synology NAS (DS920+), each loaded with 14TBx4 disks. The first one is used as main storage, we got the same one to expand our storage, and I figured it’s easier from a client’s pov to have both NASes joined together as a whole storage.\n What i came up with was mount both nfs shares on a VM, unify them with mergerfs and then re-export from VM. It worked but as my senior team member said it’s a single point of failure, therefore I duplicated the VM then spawned another one as a load balancer (HAProxy), but in the end it did not work as NFS refused to mount the LB IP.\n I want to know if it’s possible to unify them under a shared volume or one NFS export.\n I heard about Ganesha and gluster fs but I did not find anything or anyone using it for a similar use case of mine.\n Does anyone have an idea how to scale out nas synology?

          "description": "We had a bad switch that started spewing malformed broadcasts onto the subnet at a satellite office. No big deal. It was older, so we replaced it. I configured it based on the configuration of the switch that went bad. I could have swore it was a /23 network.\n This, of course, was a weekend, and come Monday we had endpoints with “stuck” IP addresses that refused to renew, and weird SIP problems where calls went through without problem, but conversations were suddenly muted. I suspected a NAT problem so I went on the hunt. Two days later I still found nothing and felt defeated.\n So, there are a number of issues that lead to this, many of which “existed before me”, but I’m here now and the bottom line is it was my fault. The big boss figured it out and all I could do was slap myself on the forehead. It was originally a /24 network. We reconfigured the PBX and all downstream appliances to use a /23 space. Within 10 minutes all was well.\n Lesson learned was always verify the IP space you are working in. I could have saved myself a lot of time, frustration and embarrassment.\n BTW: I know this is more netadmin stuff. Like many of us my sysadmin duties really run the gamut.

I created some of the policies like not allowing anonoymous logins and basic objects of that sort, but some of them lost out on the winning GPO that was in place.

We had our providers on calls all day long doing traces to find the issue with no success so far ... Until we came across a comment way low in a BleepingComputer article.\n The comment mentions that enabling the Windows service \"Routing and remote access\" helped them fix a similar issue.\n We were skeptical as this is usually used on a server and not on workstations, but we tried it anyway and... Well damn... It actually works. All packet drops stopped.\n We are currently working with Microsoft and our VPN provider to identify what the service changes in Windows that affect this issue.\n If you are having strange stability and packet drops on VPN, give that a try maybe.\n Disclamer: I do not know all consequences of enabling this service yet.

But it takes time and it's still used for servers and a bunch of legacy stuff. Either way our offboarding procedure is just weird to me. It works, bjt we have a tonne of disabled users and the number only grows. \n Currently our procedure is as follows:\n  \n Right away:\n  \nUser is disabled disabled\n \nPassword is reset reset\n \nuser is removed from all groups (effectivly removing licences as this is applied using groups)\n \nuser is added to a single group that gives them an exchange online plan 1 license license\n \nuser is converted to a shared mailbox\n \n -1 other user gets access to their mailbox and 1 forward is made. To the same user or another user( chosen by the manager)\n  \n After 2 months:\n  \nadd old_ prefix to users mail address and UPN UPN\n \nremove delegation and forward\n \n  \n Now i guess my question is, at what point do we just delete the user account? Security are worried that deleting a user will also remove them from our sentinel and other logs. Or at least make it harder to trace the logs. But at some point i think that this is irrelevant.

Additionally, Outlook had issues. Upon investigation, I discovered that major websites like YouTube and Facebook were displaying SSL certificate errors. In the Chrome web console, I noticed recurring reconnection errors. The organization mentioned that they had recently upgraded their Comcast connection and were told that their modem was outdated. Consequently, I advised them to contact Comcast and request a replacement. A technician replaced the modem, tested it, and confirmed that all sites were functioning properly on his PC.\n However, when I reevaluated the situation tonight, I discovered that connecting a PC directly to the modem resulted in the same issue. Changing the DNS settings did not resolve the problem. After spending two hours troubleshooting, I found a temporary fix by enabling DNS over HTTPS, which resolved the issue for everything except Outlook.\n I am aware that this is not a long-term solution. Based on my best guess, this appears to be an issue with Comcast. However, persuading them to acknowledge and address the problem may prove challenging since they rely on the Comcast modem for DNS and DHCP services.

DUH\n OK, I just got a job, they paid my moving expenses and I started 3 weeks ago.\n In those 3 weeks, 2 weeks of time entries have been changed from around 52 hrs down to 32 & 40 since we are on 9/80 work weeks with every other Friday off. Looks like they missed a week.\n US law applies, so my understanding is that you must submit accurate timesheets regardless of whether you are in a salaried position or not. This has not affected my 2 paychecks so far, but I am concerned about my future reviews and promotions since my work is not being accurately shown.\n I'm coming to you guys for advice on how to proceed, I am a very direct and confrontational individual and do not want to start off on a bad foot, but feel this is very wrong. I have checked with my immediate supervisor who got a BS answer from HR about payroll only being used to bill vendors. And I have checked with 2 others on my team and their timesheets are correct and accurately reflect their 50 hour weeks, so I am at a loss.\n Thanks guys, I know some great advice is coming my way..\n EDIT: Some of you just really don't understand..\n I am being told to lie about the number of hours I work. This is not acceptable period. Not to mention against the law and probably in violation of SOX. \n With no official record of my time, if something were to happen I have no recourse.\n NM state law is very clear on this matter:\n 50-4-9. Records, subpoenas, etc.\n A. Every employer shall keep a true and accurate record of hours worked and wages paid to each employee. The employer shall keep such records on file for at least one year after the entry of the record.\n https://nmonesource.com/nmos/nmsa/en/item/4420/index.do#!b/50-4-9\n    submitted by    /u/AtLeastIHaveAnOffice  \n [link]   [comments]",

When we go over stuff that we did the past week and have in the agenda, I always feel like it's the equivalent of them saying 'I've updated VMware tools, migrated x from our data center to y, configured our Cisco Firepower to do this and that' and then there's me saying 'I deployed my first Autopilot pc.'\n They knew about my experience, they know what I'm capable of but I feel like a massive loser in my team.

          "description": "If you look at the CQURE Hacks 39 video on YouTube, it shows a quick demo of how easy it is to use pass-the-PRT to steal Azure PRT tokens even on a fully patched Windows system with Credential Guard enabled and TPM protections.\n The attack requires local admin access, but that isn't an insurmountable obstacle.\n Even if the local user doesn't have admin privileges, there are constantly application flaws, driver flaws and OS flaws that can be exploited to allow privilege escalation that would give the attacker local admin rights. Then there is just plain malware and zero day flaws between updates to do this if the attacker gets on a perfectly patched system. Users can be tricked into clicking on malicious links and opening files with malware and there is even occasional malware that requires no user interaction (Malvertisements and Outlook flaws that allow malware to run without even opening the message).\n You can have A/V and EDR to detect and block tools like Mimikatz, but Mimikatz does not need to run locally on the system. In the video, the data is copied to a different system with Mimikatz installed. No hacking tools need to be installed on the system being attacked.\n Besides all that can be done with the local user's Azure credentials to send spam and phishing emails and exfiltrate data, if any device admins had entered their credentials into the system (UAC prompt etc.) to assist the user within the last 14 days, their active PRT will also be on the machine and that would give the attacker access to everything the device admin has access to in the tenant.\n This type of attack gets around credential guard and TPM protections and then bypasses all forms of MFA and passwordless authentication (FIDO2 security keys etc.). So, what protection exists to prevent this?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Real_Lemon8789  \n [link]   [comments]",

The network/domain infrastructure was built by a contracting company and I swear it was designed to be broken from day one. There are 50+ virtualized servers to manage and I barely know anything about them because I came here two years after the installation and the previous sysadmins were hotshots that only applied bandaid fixes so they couldn’t tell me anything of value. The only people that saw how it ran as intended are long gone and I’m stuck piecing together whatever I can with my limited experience. Getting information out of the contracting company is next to impossible because I have to fight my way through their help desk that of course only answer to emails. And even then they are intentionally vague in order to bait my company to pay extra to go fly over to fix whatever’s wrong. I might as well not even be here. The contractors were supposed to build the network then hire junior techs to maintain it but how am I supposed to maintain anything when it’s all hidden behind a contract. I have full access to the network. Im not just a user with limited access. Yet I feel like im running into a new major issue every week and nothing is ever a quick fix or even something I’ve dealt with before. It almost feels like it was engineered to be complicated and they convinced their clients to hire under qualified techs so they can get more money to fly out and be the “subject matter experts”.

My boss is a person who is sort of a catchall for departments that don't have a home. They lead a bunch of random \"teams\" and have no real knowledge or interest in IT at all.\n In previous roles I've had at minimum an IT Director above me who could advocate for IT in the strategy of the organization, even if they weren't assisting or super knowledgeable about the tech itself. I've found that without that, IT is very much pushed off to the side and viewed as a bother.

Instead, an error message is shown:\n  \nRemoteApp Disconnected \n Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer \"cb.cloud.example.com\" for one of these reasons: \n 1) Your user account is not authorized to access the RD Gateway \"cloud.example.com\"\n 2) Your computer is not authorized to access the RD Gateway \"cloud.example.com\"\n 3) You are using an incompatible authentication method (for example, the RD Gateway might be expecting a smart card but you provided a password) \n Contact your network administrator for assistance.\n  \n​\n We are not sure why this is happening.

The room has no cabinet, old pc cases etc. \n ​\n What I have to do is take the shelves to outside of the room to make up space, build 42U Cabinet, build 2x48 Port switch, couple patch panels, build some rack servers or a workstation. And then move the ups, file server and rest pc's to the cabinet, reconnect them. Remake about 20-30 cable connectors, label each of them. \n ​\n In total cables are about 50 and they only said not to replace the whole cable. Only I can move and make a new connector.\n ​\n The thing is I said to them I would check the parts and prices for them, will not get a commission. \n It is roughly 5-day job and I am not familiar with the market.

I have one machine that keeps timing out connecting to the file share. This machine wasn’t setup or configured any differently than the others. \n I’ve checked all the common issues that are shared by all clients - network speeds, Synology SMB settings, MTUs, etc, and I’ve been unable to replicate the issue on another machine. \n I’ve also tested other variables on the client machine - different remote IPs/connections, different logins, as well as different transfer protocols - FTP, https, WebDAV. I’ve tried mounting the file share as a mapped drive and as a network connection. \n No matter what, when this machine is connected to the VPN, it can connect to the share and navigate the directories fine, but as soon as I try to transfer any file, it times out and if I’m using SMB it will freeze Windows Explorer. \n 2 other notes: - when connected to the VPN and I try to load a local IP in a web browser, say, the Synology admin portal, it also times out - the WebDAV connection has the same issues over https even when not connected to the VPN. \n What could this possibly be, and how do I test for it?\n    submitted by    /u/luckaeweb  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need to move all these devices to a new subnet.\n I have connected all these devices to an Opengear terminal and can connect to the console of all the devices. So far I have moved the management IP of all the devices to the new subnet. All the devices can ping the management IP of the other devices. I can see there are many other vlan interfaces that are still in the old subnet. Am I correct to assume that I need to assign all these vlan interfaces an IP in the new subnet?

This will be my gateway (192.168.172.1) for my new segment\n -Done setting up the necessary routes (going to internet, active directory, file servers, and other necessary networks) and policies also\n Cisco Switch:\n -Done adding the new VLAN ID on the trunk port (this trunk port is dedicated to the FW port where I setup a new VLAN interface together with the existing VLAN interfaces)\n -Done setting up the access port (new VLAN ID) for my new segment which my VM (192.168.172.2)\n VM:\n -Done setting up the necessary IP configurations (IP: 192.168.172.2 NM: /27 GW: 192.168.172.1)\n -Turned off the firewall also just to make sure\n Now here lies the problem:\n -I can't seem to ping my own gateway (192.168.172.1) from my VM (192.168.172.2) within the same network but I can ping other networks (8.8.8.8, other subnets, etc.)\n -Active directory server, file servers, and other subnets can ping the gateway (192.168.172.1) and yet it can't ping my VM (192.168.172.2) or other hosts of that network\n -The ping option in my VLAN interface is already enabled btw\n -When I tried to traceroute my gateway (192.168.172.1), it routes thru my ISP gateway\n -I tried using an existing VLAN on the access port and it can ping/traceroute it's gateway\n I'm not really sure what I'm missing here so hopefully you can help me with this\n    submitted by    /u/ciomi9  \n [link]   [comments]",

It doesn’t look like this is currently setup (I’m not a network engineer).\n If we can reach them, why wouldn’t they be able to reach us? I currently have a firewall configured to route traffic to them, and our guest VMs also are setup to route to them, the hosts currently are not but I don’t see how this would cause an issue?

But I'm working on connecting a recent circuit we acquired for Azure express route through an ISP thats using Megaport to peer up with our Azure tenant.\n There's still some foggy design once I get the actual circuit portion connected in but I'm thinking of pathing it in to a couple of ASRs in our DC as the BGP peering between our Primary DC and the Azure Expressroute circuit.\n I've got a design picture from the ISP showing a single switch (we have this in our DC right now) connecting to one of our cisco switches using a Q-in-Q trunk, then after that it's basically up to us for the routing and potentially firewall side of things.\n My question to them was trying to ask if I need to be aware of their C-tags on our end, or if I just setup a single q-in-q trunk to our switch and tag our own vlans and somehow work with that after the fact.\n They only replied to me with info on the 2 CTags (308, 307), one for primary and one for secondary as Expressroute seems to setup a couple BGP sessions as built in redundancy, so I'm a bit confused on how to differentiate, or setup the layer 2 config, for the primary and secondary use case on our end with only the 1 physical connection from the ISP.\n Has anyone ever worked on such a setup before with express route like this?

One will be a private network with full firewall and all, another will be a similar one but will specifically run a few servers that are ported out through the firewall. And the last one is going to hold my email server (I’ve got rdns and ip configs in place)\n Both of the “public” networks will be routed to a single server, R720 running proxmox(because I like it) and will be internally routed to the vms it needs to go on. My next no open ports network, is going to be my management network I guess, specifically so I can configure the pfsense when needed without exposing the webui of it to any other server. I’m thinking a little Dell optiplex running Ubuntu server and something j can connect to it with. I plan to have some sort of vpn set up so I can vpn in and talk to that management network.\n I know this sounds not the best and messy, hence why I’m here. It’s the best I could come up with in a few nights. Some guidance would be nice to see what other people recommend for this. I’m looking for advise on more of the networking side and how to more efficiently implement this setup.\n    submitted by    /u/Kn0t5  \n [link]   [comments]",

I then did a deep dive on the common Python libraries (Netmiko/Nornir/Napalm) and Ansible.\n I now work at a big bank and realize writing one-off scripts to do configuration management/config checking doesn’t cut it, because while running a script at the CLI works, it’s not consumable for a wider audience.\n My opinion is that building web applications that serve a network automation purpose is the ideal way to do it, but the time investment to learn web development is really big.\n So my questions are what are the use cases of network automation, what is the size of your company, and do scripts serve your needs or have you needed to build web applications that are shareable/usable by a wider audience.\n I have my Devnet associate and I am fairly adept at scripting, but when I see people like John Capobianco and Devnet Dan combining web development with network automation, I feel like I can’t even say I’m in the network automation space.\n Sure, I can commit my time to learning a bit of web development, but with so many vendor and open source tools dedicated to network automation, I don’t want to commit to something that may not have a big payoff.\n    submitted by    /u/Prestigious-Shame-36  \n [link]   [comments]",

My VAR is doing the driving on implementation but I'm trying to familiarise/learn myself hence the (probably easy) question.\n In my lab, this is my current setup. The two core switches are MLAG'd together w/ VRRP for core redundancy, that's fine and works great.\n For the edge/access setup, I have two /30 interconnecting VLANs with OSPF interface enabled as P2P. On our current network, this is how we do it with RIP. I then have two default routes, one pointing to the core's SVI on each link for redundancy. It works, but it's slow(ish) to rebuild OSPF routes when one of the links go down.\n An option I had in mind was potentially setting up a VRRP in a /29 for the SVI's and then MLAG'ing the ports on the core, with a static route on the edge to the VRRP address - but it feels like I'm reinventing the wheel somewhat and overcomplicating.\n If you were setting up a new edge/access in your network, how would you do the redundancy which offers the best speed and convergence time?\n Any help/guidance would be much appreciated, thanks. :)\n    submitted by    /u/RiceeeChrispies  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Friends,\n Sorry for the lame title - I am not sure how to best summarize this. We have a 10g connection to Equinix fabric using a fabric \"Port\". Riding across that fabric are multiple \"Connections\" that are lower bandwidth. Since my layer-2 connection is 10g there is nothing to hold back transmission other than the policer for the fabric Connection. Is there anything I should do to policy the outbound traffic before putting it on the Equinix fabric to protect my data? I am sending syslogs across this path, and there is no current option for making those logs use a reliable protocol. Is there anything I can do to prevent or minimize the policer drops from losing those log packets? If TCP it would drop and kick off the whole TCP retry process. Bit since UDP there's just no way. \n Right now I'm just watching the bandwidth with a 60-second graph and we're not going over 50% of our allocated bandwidth. I'm worried about the unexpected bursts due to some security event and then losing that fidelity. Is there anything I can do to help? Or is just more bandwidth the only answer outside of switching to a log relay with (more) reliable TCP?\n    submitted by    /u/Rednarb  \n [link]   [comments]",

Group switches in group of 4, one vlan for each group of 4 switches. Group 1, vlan 110 (172.21.111.0/24) group 2 (172.21.112.0/24).

The Outside interface is connected to a Hotspot with an ethernet port configured for IP passthrough. The hotspot is connected to my outside interface of the cisco router, the hotspot IP address is 172.16.1.1 which is my cisco routers gateway. I also have a switch connected to the ciscos inside interface which that switch interface is 192.168.2.2. From the cisco router I CAN ping internet addresses through the hotspot. This is because the source is the 172.x network. When I source the ping from the inside interface, 192.x network I get no replies. From my switch I can ping the outside interface of the router, 172.x but obviously not the Hotspot gateway of 172.16.1.1. I was thinking I needed to setup NAT on my router so I setup an access list to permit all traffic, setup nat inside source to the outside interface and configured the 2 ethernet ports from inside/outside natting. Not luck.\n I\"m sure this sounds confusing but any help would be appreciated. It's probably something simple I am missing.

          "description": "So, a bright spark at my company ordered the wrong fibre optic couplers. We are trying to convert our profibus to fibre, but here's the kicker. The converter is for MM and the clients fibre run is SM fibre. How this passed the FAT I'll never know, but here we are. \n There's a few constraints with this, namely the ATEX areas this equipment is in. We used Bartec as they had a full rated assembly for our needs, and was fully certified. Until we noticed the converters were the wrong type. \n Time is of the essence, and as we need to try and solve this before we demobilise, I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas. Due to the ATEX area, ideally the fix will not be an active one (I.E. The fix cannot require power inputs) as this would likely invalidate the IECex rating, and we're back to square one. \n The fibre is under 1k in length with a few splices (I'll need to Otdr for exact losses). \n Would these work? \n https://fibrain.com/product/mode-conditioning-patchcords/\n https://fibrain.com/product/converters-for-hybrid-sm-mm-transmission/\n Thanks in advance, we have until Friday to solve this one.

There's no sort of Access control -- all the vlans can talk to the other vlans. All the routes for these VLANs are learned routes.\n What the company wants now is to have all traffic run through the firewall so we can more granularly control who accesses what on what port (a nightmare to me, but it is what it is)\n Is there any scenario where I can really test this, or am I looking at a rip and replace of my routing config all in one go?

I believe I saw the Aruba reference design say /16s are fine. I understand this is possible as with a controller you can control the BUM traffic as it ingresses.\n This has me wondering, is there any reason this isn't possible on wired network where you have the ability to apply centralised policy at a switch port level on ingress traffic? I know with Aruba it is technically possible to emulate the wireless setup with wired traffic by tunnelling wired traffic to controllers although we couldn't find any examples of customers doing this. Is it not possible on a traditional wired network where you have a NAC and centralised policy that can be applied at port level to discard BUM traffic there?

I'm interested if others have experience of or opinions about connecting a subset of servers directly to the underlay, for a kind of hybrid IP + EVPN-VXLAN fabric.\n The use case is where there are a mix of servers which require pure L3, L2VPN and L3VPN connectivity which are connected to a single leaf/spine network. There could be different design options to cater for that, ranging from co-locating those servers on the same leafs, splitting them onto separate leafs with common spines, or splitting them into separate pods.\n The benefit would be having one network fabric servicing all flavours of server, the possibility for incremental upgrades (e.g \"upgrading/downgrading\" a port from L3 -> VXLAN without having to re-cable it to a new network). \n Are there downsides to this hybrid approach? Maybe scalability considerations as TCAM has to be optimised for both EVPN-VXLAN and \"normal\" IP routing?

Now after some research into why it didn't work, I'm finding that the cell service I have isn't using publicly routed IPs.\n I've tried the IOT Advanced subscription option from Cradlepoint, but it's painfully slow and not at all easy to use. Do I have any options to get some sort of inexpensive VPN option similar to what was included with the Cradlepoint Netcloud subscription? Thanks again for any help, or suggestions on a better place to ask this question.\n    submitted by    /u/Femputer_user  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, if I have a device (2.41.10.10,255.255.0.0) on VLAN 41 (2.41.0.1) that allowed me to monitor it by accessing a web browser, and I wanted to be able to access that web browser from a device (2.11.1.x) on VLAN 11 (2.11.0.1)? How does this change if one device is on VLAN 11 (2.11.0.1) on switch A and the device hosting the web browser is in VLAN 41 (2.41.0.2) on switch B, with a trunk between the two? Both switches are running Cisco OS. I’ve tried messing with static routes a bit, but have had little luck and I’m struggling to understand the routing required, but I’m sure it’ll click with a bit of help. TIA!

          "description": "Hi all, I'm troubleshooting a point to point link connecting two data centers. It's 10gig, but deployed by a provider who packetizes, so it does not behave like a traditional 10gig wave / private line which just repeats light. This means you can usually get up to several gigabits on a single TCP stream, but need more streams to fully utilize the circuit. There's about 50ms of latency between locations due to geography. \n The issue we're having is TCP performance is mostly horrible, but sometimes goes back to near normal. Using iperf, if I test between two nodes on the same layer two vlan that's bridged across this link, sometimes I'll see possibly close to 2 gbps, as low as 100 Mbit/sec, but typically averaging out in the sub-600 Mbit/sec range. Watching the linux tcp counters, I can see numerous retransmits, timeouts, backoffs, etc. So, clearly the circuit is dropping packets. \n If I switch to UDP and vary the send rate, 1Gbps or lower gets me 0.068% packet loss, 2Gbps 0.3%, 2.5Gbps 0.89%, 3 Gbps and we're into the 1.1%+ range with spikes as high as 6%. \n The end to end setup had been working fine for half a year and then on a specific day began this behavior.\n Has anyone ever seen a transceiver issue cause behavior like this? My experience has been those will have light issues and/or affect all traffic types. Light is strong in both directions. They also tend to go from working to failing, not something in between. In contrast, I've routinely seen this kind of issue affect circuits when there is an overloaded node in the path, an incorrectly configured QoS or rate limit config somewhere, etc. The transit provider assures me none of that is in place nor any overloaded or failing links in the path.\n    submitted by    /u/ispcolo  \n [link]   [comments]",

The dream state will allow me to upload a map of the site to the app and then do BLE/Wifi locationing to know exactly where clients are having packet loss issues on the WLAN (I know this is a dream state that probably doesn't exist yet).\n If none of you know of anything paid/free then I guess I will have to build something myself which I really don't want to have to do... I know an Ekahau has Latency/Packet Loss monitoring, but I am after an app we can put on clients and monitor all the time.\n    submitted by    /u/rudiger420  \n [link]   [comments]",

This person was the bearer of all secrets basically, so nothing seems to be \"typical\" and I have had the joy of problem solving all of this the past few months, reverse engineering the pieces of you will. \n Last week we had an issue with our Juniper SRX340 Firewall at one of the buildings. The power light is green, yet the \"STAT\" light is solid amber. I am trying to get into the device to troubleshoot. But i am blocked getting to it from the server (obviously) and connecting to the management port does not seem to do anything. The guide on Junipers website shows \"figures\" for ports our SRX340 does not have. \n Can someone please tell me how to connect to the SRX340 to check what the error is? My thought is the device isn't fully booting, and that's why I'm unable to manage/access any \"normal\" way. But thought I would ask in case I'm missing something, regarding how to manage/access the device to check why the \"STAT\" light is amber! \n P.S. I let it boot for about 45 minutes and it would randomly (at no obvious intervals, as I was timing the power up) the fan would kick on into high speed, and the \"STAT\" light would turn green for about 5 seconds, and then back to Amber.

          "description": "Wanted to create a list for new/junior engineers looking to grow. Any one else wish to add to my list, please feel free. What I am laying down are the rules taught to me by my mentor. An engineer who started with Cisco in 1989 and literally designed and oversaw Caterpillar/BMW/Mercedes etc etc etc global networks before he retired.\n Rule #1 Be hungry to learn. Every interaction, even after 30+ years of networking, is an opportunity to learn and grow. Being humble and hungry also makes you more desirable to work with!\n Rule #2 Lab. Even if you think you have the right answer, you are probably wrong if you haven't labbed! If you are learning something new, lab it up. Take packet captures to see if you get the expected packets. Learn to read said packets while in the lab. Never forget to lab.\n Rule #3 RFCs, RFCs, RFCs. Taking the time to look up an RFC is generally faster than contacting a consultant or vendor for a detailed answer. It is likely, they are going to read said RFC before replying back to you.\n Rule #4 Follow the packets. Our job revolves around moving packets from A-B or from C to D-K. Understand where a packet comes in from and why then where it is going to move to next and why. Do this node by node. Whether this is super basic VLAN only or the crazy complex Multicast over EVPN, following the path of the packet is a concept which will never die!\n Rule #5 When following the network path, draw out the topology. You may have 50 devices in your whole network but the packet for source to destination may only cross 4 devices. Understanding this will always greatly simply things and prevent a 4-day marathon of troubleshooting an issue. In most cases, shortens those sessions to just a few hours or less.\n Rule #6 See rule #1.\n    submitted by    /u/Eastern-Back-8727  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, so i am starting the process of shifting my career towards a more focused Networking path. Not really looking at jobs yet, just mainly brushing up on old subjects and equipment configs that i haven't done in awhile and a thought struck me. Now that we live in a post covid world, what is the outlook for Network engineers to be fully remote? At the beginning of 2021 i worked as a temp IT support tech for a few months for a local resort whose network support was located in a different state. Yes, the engineers would visit every now and again but mostly they would remote in whenever there was a problem or a need to. This resorts company had properties nation wide but their network support team was based in FL. I'm curious as to how common this type of arrangement is.

All devices on the /24 have their own firewall, and are considered to be \"on the public internet\". I would like to use OSPF to distribute routes between these routers so that, for example, a laptop with a private IP behind Router 1 could print to a printer that has a private IP behind Router 2. \n Am I correct in assuming that it would be a bad idea to use the interfaces associated with the public /24 for distributing routes via OSPF, because that would effectively be routing packets from internal devices over an un-trusted network? Or is this a non-issue and I am over-complicating it?

I just started a month ago at a new Fortune 100 company with a massive, stupidly complex network. \n I am so overwhelmed. Everything is behind jumpboxes (poorly documented) so it’s difficult to understand what to jump through in order to connect to anything, making manual network discovery difficult. \n I come from a Cisco shop, and everything is Juniper and Arista here. \n There are literally dozens of VRFs inside their internal MPLS core. They run EVPN and VXLAN, stuff I’ve never worked with before. There are dozens and dozens of firewalls. The team has started a new network segmentation project, and there is little to no documentation on what subnets belong to each segment, what ‘zones’ are in each segment, etc. \n I feel like I’m drowning. Normally I try to buckle down and start from the core and work my way outward, documenting physical and logical connections, but this place has literally hundreds of devices in the core. The routing is extremely complex with tons of BGP, MPLS, EVPN, VXLAN, VRFs everywhere, SDWAN.\n Just need some advice. Words of encouragement. SOMETHING.

The firewalls are doing iBGP between them and because of the AD of 200 routes prefer the ISIS interface to go to the other side of the network and will come in through the other firewall on return traffic because it is the default route. I was thinking it would be beneficial to set up ISIS peering across the same link as the BGP as this is a point to point and will have a reduced cost allowing the traffic from the outside networks to route that way. Will I have an issue peering two isis neighbors both advertising the default route through default originate or will I need to filter it between hosts somehow?\n Edit: thinking about it I would think the local static default route will take precidence in the firewall and the default-originate route would never be installed unless we were to lose internet peering on one side.

Each connection may be a trickle of syslogs, or may be bursty during a security event, but still relatively low bandwidth requirements. However, once they all land at the one VPN concentrator there is quite a flow of those syslog messages on the wire. We are trying to send those to a log analyzer/SIEM in the cloud, and we are trying to overcome some bandwidth cost constraints there. Syslog is normally fire-and-forget, so if we have any bandwidth contention, it is possible for some of those messages to get lost.\n What do you recommend to overcome this possible data loss? More bandwidth is the easy option, but even then how do you scale for an event that bursts above even that? I'm thinking some sort of relay that stores and forwards, but forwards across the lower bandwidth link with a reliable method (RELP or the like?) to remove or significantly lessen the likelihood of data loss.\n Or am I looking at this all wrong?\n    submitted by    /u/Rednarb  \n [link]   [comments]",

A solution would be to use 4G routers at both ends and use VPN tunnelling to create a link. I think I will be able to use VLC streaming to gain access to the sensor screen from the base station laptop (I have seen someone make this work). However, I am not sure on the exact configurations and settings required Networking/LAN is really something i have no idea about I'm an electrical/aerospace engineer, so this is alien to me.\n Could I for example connect the sensor to a 4g router (TP link Wireless AC750) with an RJ45 cable and have a usb 4G modem connected (prepaid/postpaid 4G). Have the same setup on the base station with the laptop and using a VPN gain connection between them? I think this is called site to site IPsec VPN correct me if I'm wrong, it's quite confusing for me I have even heard the term DMZ host and not sure which to use. Or alternatively would a ubiquity Bullet AC work this uses their AirMax Protocol (based on TDMA) WiFi whihc has great range with the right antenna.\n Also, as a side topic, if the above were correct, can I connect 2 devices (sonar, onboard pc) to the same router onboard so that they share the same network. Is it possible to use that network to get the sonar screen live and at the same time use something like tightVNC to gain access to the onboard pc remotely from the base station? if they are all on the same network/LAN it should be possible they would just have different IP addresses?\n Thanks for the replies in advance I really appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/Due_Theme_3191  \n [link]   [comments]",

These consist of two clusters, one located at each site. The BGP configuration is functioning correctly without any issues.\n However, when these routes are redistributed into OSPF (Cisco), problems arise. Everything operates as expected until we start conducting failover tests. We sequentially disconnect ISP routers 1 through 3 in an attempt to force traffic through each router along the path. When we reach router 4, everything still continues to function properly.\n The issue emerges when router 1 is reconnected. As soon as this happens, it immediately expects, via BGP, that the traffic will be routed through it. However, the OSPF routing table has not been updated at this point and is still pointing towards router 4. This creates a black hole, as the routes are expected to come from router 4 via OSPF, but from the perspective of BGP, router 1 is now online.\n The underlying problem is that router 4 never lost its link state since it still owns the routes (OSPF).\n I hope I have managed to clearly explain this complex scenario. If anyone can shed light on how to resolve this issue, please do reach out. If there is something incorrect with my configuration, I am open to suggestions.

All traffic goes to cloud servers anyway (let’s ignore services like AirDrop for now).\n When designing a primitive wifi network (PoE switch and # wireless APs) solely for smartphones and tablets (no IoT, let’s say a guest wifi in a hotel or library), how does it improve security (overall and for individual devices) to firewall (packet filter or hardware) compared to just directly connecting the network to the internet (fiber uplink, just setting a default route to the switch’s SFP+ WAN interface)?\n Client isolation (everybody can just access WAN, not nearby clients) can be a security improvement (hotel wifi) or disadvantage (school wifi), but how about incoming connections?\n Because when the mobile devices leave the wifi, they anyway could be vulnerable via cellular (some mobile ISPs deploy public addresses also on IPv4, smartphone is directly reachable=vulnerable from the world). The wifi basically is just to bypass the expensive cellular interface and bridge the devices via cheap wifi in this scenario.\n  \nIs it necessary to consider VLANs if clients are isolated and only access the WAN/cloud? Eg. one ESSID+VLAN for staff and guests on their own ESSID+VLAN? Does it really have security improvements?\n  \nAny ideas or best practices for such a wifi scenario?\n    submitted by    /u/SFP-ONU  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got some networking changes coming down the pipe and I need to move this connection on the N3024f side to a couple of the SFP 1G ports (Gi1/0/1-24). The SFP+ DAC cables I've been using won't work (in theory, and in practice, I tried them..) between SFP and SFP+ ports.\n What's the right DAC cable (or right kind of cable)? Due to the switches being a bit on the old side (I know..) I'm getting a fair amount of conflicting information about whether it's possible at all or what DAC cables might work? It seems like some people have backwards compatibility luck connecting SFP and SFP+ ports with DAC cables (provided the SFP+ side is locked 1G speed), but its not clear how much of this is the cable or what type of cable or whether it's some kind of vendor specific thing.\n I could always just use a couple of the N2048p copper ports to the N3024f RJ combo ports and be done with it, but the N2048p side is pretty full and I'd like to not lose usable access ports in the process. Another alternative option is using optics between the switches or 1G RJ45 ports on the N2048p side to the combo ports on the 3024f side.\n But DAC cables would overall be a better setup -- less parts, etc, but its not clear it will work or the cables for it to work even exist.\n    submitted by    /u/OperationMobocracy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, \n I'm working on some AV systems with heavy bandwidth usage on many multicast streams (~10gig per stream) and I'm weighing up the benefits and drawbacks of extending the fabric with either switch stacking or just LAGG uplinks in some topology or another. It is my understanding that stacked switches will flood all their multicast traffic between all stack members as they're logically one switch which is a drawback. \n However, my question is - will links between stack members automatically loadbalance traffic (so 3 x 10gig fibers becomes 30gig link) - or do you need to setup the stack and then put your stack links into a LAGG effectively meaning you have the same limitations of a LAGG when doing a stack i.e. same limit of number of switchports that can participate in the LAGG.\n If they loadbalance automatically, is the load balancing performed via a different method that would make one method more efficient at loadbalancing i.e. layer 2 or layer 3 hashing?\n I'm aware this will vary depending on the chip used in the switch but any info regardless of switch brand & model would be useful, particularly Netgear m4300 range.\n ​\n One additional bonus question whilst I'm at it - is there any difference in the efficiency of loadbalancing when comparing a static LAGG vs dynamic (LACP)? \n ​\n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/shivellebits  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ideally I would like to just use a command line or something simple but thinking of using the wands, however when researching which one to get I saw that some people were having issues using them on managed switches so before I go wasting money thought best to ask the experts.\n For context, I work in a building that has multiple groups all using the same infrastructure and the IT guy for my group with full permission to be in the room, however there are others who also do the IT for their group with same permissions. The network team look after the switches remotely but unless you tell them the specific switch and port they don't want to help, even if you provide them with the MAC address to look up they still want visual confirmation.\n    submitted by    /u/Traust  \n [link]   [comments]",

Dark fiber is being terminated on these switches in both sites.\n The routing is simple with a /30 mask being used and no ip switchport being configured on each dark fiber port on each switch. EIGRP is being used for routing.\n We use Solarwinds to monitor these devices.\n Now the problem is we are suddenly seeing issues on this dark fiber link starting today, was working fine until yesterday (last week there was a fiber cut which caused interruptions but has been working fine until yesterday since the fix). The port keeps flapping randomly every 30 minutes or so. Will go down for a few minutes say like 3 or 10 minutes at a time and will come back up.\n We opened a ticket with Comcast (dark fiber is from Comcast) and they sent someone to check the their equipment. He came checked within 15 minutes and determined it wasn't an issue on their end then got an email from them saying that it could be an issue with sfps/bad jumpers.\n Now upon checking on solarwinds I see a bunch of receive errors today not necessarily coinciding with the flapping but I do see them. It's about 10-18k received errors (only receive) on one of the switches (haven't put the other 3850 switch into monitoring yet) and this was today. Until yesterday the received errors were just 198-200 or so.\n So could this be an sfp issue on this particular port? Could swapping out this 10Gig sfp fix the issue?

One of our customers uses a web-based database that has stopped being accessible from their network. We run a Unifi firewall and are using Comcast - and the DB company is using Cloudflare for DNS and proxy. We've disable IDS, bounced the server/firewall/modem etc, and still get the message in the screenshot. However, there is one computer on the network that can access the site - using Chrome on the VMHost. Tried it in internet explorer on the VMHost - no joy. And no joy anywhere else. The database is generally accessible to the whole internet. DB provider swears they are not blocking our public IP. I've switched the DNS forwarder on the DC to use Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) I'm out of ideas, and the inter webs have no information on the source of this block message - I literally cannot find anything in google that tells me the source of it.

As the audio more and more relies on IP networks, I find myself seeking for advice from fellow network engineers. This time it is not directly connected to audio, only control of it. \n I have this mixing console, that can be controlled via lan from iPad app. Although most of console manufacturers let us connect many iPads simultaneously, this particular manufacturer provides access from only one iPad at a time (limited via software), which is very unconventional. Is there a way to bypass this limitation using router? \n My idea is that multiple iPads connect to router via wifi (wlan). \n Router acts as a bridge (between wlan and eth) and routes traffic trough eth to mixing console. All outgoing eth traffic should come to console from same IP. \n Console returns response trough eth to router.\n Router makes the response in to multicast and transmits it over bridged network to wlan for all wifi devices.\n ​\n Does this makes any sense?

So each server must have the same version of the back-end.\n - We need to extract some data's from each server to make them anonymous and build worldwide stats, which needs to be accessible for any user.\n For the first point, I was thinking of simply open new VPS on a given country, and just deploy the last stable version of the backend, and link all of them across our DNS. But i'm not sure if it's a good practice to have only 1 DNS server for people who want's to access a server far from the DNS ? Don't really know how does it works actually.\n For the 2nd point, i was thinking about a kind of proxy server, that put itself between the country server and the client, that will collect the anonymous data and store it in a separate database, and then duplicate and sync this server in the cloud to make it available all around the world ?\n ​\n My issues concern the stack i should use to make this kind of setup. My knowledge stop to NGINX, Docker & Node.js to be quick, and that seems to involve more complicated stuff, so if you can point me to some docs and/or softwares that would works for my purpose ?\n ​\n Thanks guys\n    submitted by    /u/Chichaaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have several wireless captures taken with my Aircheck G3 that gives me access to capture all of the frames being sent on a channel, including management and control frames.\n I am intending to determine the amount of airtime that beacons are consuming. From the captures, I already know that about 40% of the frames captured are beacons, but I want to determine how much actual airtime this corresponds to.\n I know beacons are transmitted at the slowest mandatory data rate, and I know the frame size. But I don't think the airtime calculation is as simple as the frame size divided by the data rate (with the appropriate unit conversions between bytes and Mbps, of course), because I know the bits can be packed into higher MCS indexes / QAM encodings. (Or, am I thinking about this backwards, whereas a 24 Mbps data rate is the what you get at a fixed MCS / QAM?)\n So, in summary - with access to the PHY and MAC layers from an 802.11 capture, can I calculate airtime consumed for each frame? Or is there not enough info in a frame?\n This is in an 802.11ax network, btw, and I know it can get even more tricky with OFDMA's resource unit allocations, which I don't see any evidence of in the frame dumps. \n    submitted by    /u/wifi_engineer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Multiple (tens) of branch offices.\n Solution option 1 is FortiGate on each branch office, and also on HQ. They can then connect them with tunnels and whatnot as use-cases appear. It's a desentralized solution which I do like. Nothing needing user-licensing is also just nice. Possibilites are quite grand.\n Solution option 2 is Cisco Secure Access SASE with Meraki gear. It's a centralized solution, which means all branch traffic is piped through there. I read there's some 250 Mbps limits pr connection, which scares me, and it's a lot \"younger\" solution (but does that mean it's still immature?). Licensing is ofc worse, being Cisco. It does however bring a very centralized management as it's all centralized.\n Does anybody have good (or bad) experience with this Cisco, Meraki, Umbrella mash-up? Would love to hear your 2 cents. I'm very familiar with Forti, no experience on Meraki.\n The use-case is first and foremost internet connectivity, then adding on some security (web filter etc), and then possibly adding some centralized service from HQ (interconnecting to a partner or publishing a private app or server for instance).\n    submitted by    /u/Roy-Lisbeth  \n [link]   [comments]",

Until the timeout is reached and its prepared for a rekey.\n Now with it being an IKEv2 tunnel PFS is only enabled upon the first re-key of the tunnel. Once this rekey happens, TCP traffic seems to stop working. Ping/Traceroute all seem to work fine. \n I don't understand why PFS is adding that much overhead to the Packet. As if I set the DF bit to clear, the packets are fragmented and TCP connections work fine again. So this is leading me to some kind of MTU/MSS issue.\n I tested a ping from R1-->R2 (without fragmentation) and the most I can get through before PFS is enabled is 1280 bytes, after PFS is enabled the max I can go is 1150 (alot of overhead being added to the pack which is strange). Which is an extremely small size (in my opinion) to set the max TCP-mss to.\n Now im waiting for someone to give me a PCAP of the trouble router to find the optimal MSS/MTU size, hopefully the issue will be more present there. \n I have a few sites working just fine with just ISAKMP/GRE/IPSEC setup. \n Sorry I have been troubleshooting this for some time now.

Any help on what to brush up on or look out for would be greatly appreciated. Obviously I am aware that this is a very broad question and the interviewer can ask anything.\n Background: Years of IT support with some network admin experience thrown in. I currently have my CCNA, A+, Security + although it has been over a year since the exam.\n To give a little bit about the job posting without revealing too much. They are asking for on preferred qualifications, (experience in that niche field) which I have. CCNA which I have.\n Here is some of the technical listed.\n experience managing data networks with Cisco routers and switches\n experience configuring Cisco network equipment\n Palo Alto firewalls, F5 load balancing, Cisco 9000 series, and Cisco Nexus Platform\n I have been studying all week and brushing up on my CCNA material. But I wanted to come to my fellow reddit goers for any shared network engineer interview experiences that may guide me.\n If I am in the wrong place, Please let me know and I will promptly remove.\n God speed gentlemen.\n ​\n ​\n Edit: ** Wow! I was not expecting all the comments and support. \n Thanks a lot guys! \n This certainly has helped me feel better about the interview and the process moving forward.

I'm in charge of administering two Cisco routers, each equipped with 2 WAN ports and 4 LAN ports. One of the routers serves as the main router in an MPLS network, connected to the corporate network. The backup router connects the corporate network via DMVPN.\n Currently, the LAN is directly connected to both WAN routers, ensuring redundancy through HSRP and IP SLAs. However, we now want to introduce a firewall cluster between the LAN and the WAN, so that the LAN side is protected by the firewalls and the default gateways for the LAN networks reside on the firewall. To achieve this, we plan to establish a transit network between the Cisco routers and the firewall cluster.\n The customer's network are isolated from other customers using VRFs. We are currently utilizing MPBGP with iBGP for the LAN customer networks and OSPF for overlay purposes.\n Here's what we have implemented in the past so far: redundancy through OSPF with corresponding costs and a distribute list to only learn specific networks.\n I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or insights on how to achieve redundancy for the firewall cluster in the most straightforward manner. Are there any other methods or best practices you could recommend?\n Thanks in advance for your help! \n Edit: https://imgur.com/a/uMNFc5e - for visualization\n    submitted by    /u/errore_maximus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n I am aware that this may be a controversial topic that has been discussed before, but some of the existing threads include arguments probably not of relevance any more (e.g., power consumption of first generation NICs) or do not apply in my specific scenario (e.g., no plans to change to 10Gbit/s switching). So here goes:\n We have a NAS (Synology DS1821+) which is used for central data storage via 1Gbit/s LAN to a multitude of users - there is no intent to change this. However, one of our servers needs access to a lot of data being stored on this server, which is why we thought to upgrade to 10Gbit for this single connection (going up to 25Gbit does not seem warranted since we use SATA drives in the NAS). The distance between server and NAS are just a few meters, so we would not need the benefits fiber provides in this area. Costs should be kept as low as reasonable.\n - Would you suggest copper or fiber in this context? \n - We initially planned to use Mellanox ConnectX-4 on the server, but even off-brand copper SFP+ modules are way more expensive than I thought - on the contrary, the fiber version of synology's NICs are more expensive :D\n - We could also purchase a 10Gbit NIC for the server with RJ45: Do you recommend an Intel version? I have heard that Intel is leaving the networking market (but that may have been just for switches), so I am a little worried about long-term support. There are also versions of Intel NICs from different manufacturers (HP, DELL, etc.)...are these 100% compatible in any server (running Windows Server 2022) or just in servers of that manufacturer?\n Just let me know what you think :).\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/peter_cass  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have 7 years overall experience and the certs to go for it (CCNA, CCNP + some Juniper ones too). \n I'm curious how the B2B market for network engineers looks in the EU looks for you guys. Because to me, this market looks really weird. \n On the one hand, there seem to be plenty of new positions open. On the other hand, even though I have the \"open to work\" tag on LinkedIn, I have one or two recruiters reaching out to me. Back during the Covid days, I got between 3-5 offers per week and I didn't even have the \"open to work\" tag. Even if I apply to positions (EU wide, looking for a digital nomad lifestyle), only 1-in-10 even comeback with an offer and their meaning of hybrid is relocation to their country. \n What are your thoughts on this ?

          "description": "Hi,\n I am after some guidance/advise on implementing OSPF for one of our customers and I'm getting a little confused with the design implementation options. To give some background, we have a customer which has 1 main site and 4 branch sites (5 sites total). Each of those sites has their own VLANs that site on their core switches, and then there is a static default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the firewall. On each firewall there is a VPN to the central site for accessing services etc. The drawback to this implementation is that there is no 'inter-site' routing at the minute and to access another site you need to go out from the central site. \n With this in mind, I'm looking to implement OSPF but just not sure on how to design this, would all 5 sites sit in area 0, or would the main site be area 0 and the other 4 sites be their own respective areas? As I say, each site has their own core switches which the VLAN interfaces reside on so there are technically 2 x L3 devices (core switches and firewalls) at each site. I plan to use IPsec VPNs for the interconnectivity and utilise VTIs on the tunnel ends. I've tried to read up on this and view example topologies and although I understand the fundamentals of OSPF, I seem to be missing the very basics of a real world deployment!\n Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/YqPKoad6eNB6  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some of my co workers are convinced that newer model media converters we are using are storing mac addresses like a switch would. Reason for this assumption is we have noticed that if we unplug the device on the media converter and then plug in a second device, the second device will not authenticate, because the switch is still seeing the first mac. The fix for this seems to be power cycling the media converter. Shutting and no shutting the switch interface does not seem to fix it, only power cycling the media converter.\n We actually had a device that was connected and failing mab authentication, but even when the device was removed, we still saw logs populating on the switch saying the device was failing. Personally, I was thinking this could be something with DHCP snooping still holding the mac in the database, or maybe some kind of AAA thing. But I really dont see how a media converter could be holding a mac, unless im wrong. \n Does this make any sense at all? I was always under the assumption that all media converters are layer 1 devices, and they in no way store any information at all.\n    submitted by    /u/GC_Player  \n [link]   [comments]",

As this is mostly covering open standards I am hoping that this is the more appropriate place to ask these questions.\n I am struggling to find answers from Google and have reached out to another network engineer who isn't sure either.\n Once I have configured a secure ISAKMP connection between devices, I am aware that the device then negotiates an appropriate IPsec policy to follow. However going through the system help and exploring available commands, I have noticed that you can define an IPsec transform set without specifying most of the IPsec framework.\n As an example, I have made an IPsec transform set with the following command.\n  \ncrypto ipsec transform-set TEST-TUNNEL esp-3des\n  \nThe only things that have been defined from the IPsec framework from this command is the protocol type (esp) and the confidentiality (3des). I have not defined integrity, authenticity or the diffie-hellman group. Yet the iOS has accepted my command regardless and has created the transform set.\n How does the system make up for half the framework being unconfigured? Does it take it from the existing ISAKMP policy? A system default policy? Just create a tunnel without any of those policies applied or would it be unsuccessful?\n In addition i've seen the command comp-lzs as an option, though iOS does not allow me to create a map exclusively with this alone. From Googling I have seen that it has something to do with compression and should not be used alongside voice or video, though are there any good resources that can explain the lzs algorithm and its application in laymans terms?\n    submitted by    /u/RegularCeg  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the far end of the building is our network closet and throughout the buildings UAPs were installed (2 per building). The two in bldg C went out and I have to trace the cables but I can't figure out where they go and all of the connections on the 8-port switch show the link lights are active (I don't have any network tools yet). I also ran nslookup on the network and it was able to find the IP addresses and names of all the UAPs, so I was at least able to obtain that information for the two UAPs that are down.\n Whoever installed the network left no documentation and the person I replaced passed away. I don't have the login for the Unifi gateway, the router, no cables are labeled, nothing is organized. Anyway, I think the UAPs might run to another switch before going to the switch in the network closet but no one knows where that is located or if that's even how it was done. My other thought is that I think the UAP cables might be punched down on the patch panel.\n Is it normal or common practice to run cables between 200 to 500 ft directly from the UAPs and punch them down on the patch panel as opposed to using network drops?

That should leave the subinterface traffic unaltered and on VLAN 220, but will add VLAN 200 to the traffic on the parent interface only, correct?\n Put most simply, the switch will pass the physical/parent traffic to the firewall with VLAN 200, but it won't modify the VLAN 220 tagged traffic from the subinterface because that traffic is already tagged.

We are just taking default routes from our upstreams and we have two upstream providers (one 100G and one 40G). Traffic flows out one and back in over both. It works but we are looking to take full BGP tables from both and possible a third.\n We don't really use any advanced router features, just the typical BGP, OSPF, a few static routes, and route maps. We are struggling to find a solution that offers the port speeds we use, can handle the BGP tables, and is cost effective.\n We are primarily a Cisco shop, mostly using secondhand gear. I realize our needs may push us to purchasing something new and that's fine if it is the case.\n I stumbled across the Cisco NCS line and it looks like it might be up our alley. I was mostly interested in something like the 5504 or 5508 so we could grow it as we grow. The licensing has me tripped up a little bit though. I see them secondhand but I'm not so sure I can just buy one and it would work. I guess my main question is do these things require ongoing licensing and if so can I buy one used and purchase a license for it? Or do I need to go through a reseller and purchase one new.\n I'm also open to alternative solutions. Our current Edge router is using 2 100G ports and 4 40G ports. We have quite a few 10G ports on it as well. I've been looking at Juniper's stuff and also considered looking at a whitebox solution such as Edge-Core. If we go with something else I prefer something as close to Cisco CLI as possible. Money is always an issue... we have it but I have to beg to get it.

          "description": "I currently work for a company that uses Orion for our network monitoring platform. As a directive from about, we're now looking at another SaaS type network monitoring solution. The solution seems to be far from mainstream (not going to mention by name, but HPE just bought them). There seems to be little information about anybody experience using it, but someone one of our VPs used to work with use it, and so it comes recommended and seems to be what we're going to be using soon. \n We are a very heavy Grafana shop. The vast majority of our application stack and business process flow monitored with Grafana. It's seemingly the Go To solution for most of our monitoring....except for infrastructure (network/servers). \n The primary driver to the proposed migration is cost. New vendor says they can save us tons, and we can eliminate Orion and PagerDuty. I'm questioning since we are so heavily using Grafana why we aren't at least considering it for infrastructure, I suggested we at least explore a small POC to see how it would work for what we need. \n Is there anyone out there using Grafana for their infrastructure monitoring? Horror or success stories? I'm starting to do a bit of research to see if this is a good use case, I see some articles on the topic, but not much from the aspect of 'it's what we use, here's how it works for us'.\n    submitted by    /u/RouterMonkey  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Aruba switch supports sFlow but we don't want to just sample packets, we want to log every connection--source and destination, ports, time and number of packets / amount of data transferred. We don't need to keep and store all the data that was transferred, just the connection/header info mentioned above.\n Does anyone know of a good (maybe open-source/free) platform that could provide similar analysis/logging as compared to NetFlow, but based only on gathering mirrored network traffic? We aren't looking for something inline, just need to be able to go back in time and see what traffic flows are associated with a particular IP/host. For reference, we are currently exporting NetFlow data to SolarWinds which provides a webGUI for analysis of the exported data.

So two different circuits and they handle the IP failover.\n The two CISCOs are directly connected to each other.\n I have this connected into 2 x HP 2530 Switches on a dedicated VLAN for the WAN connection.\n So CISCO1 ETH0 goes to Switch 1 port 48 and CISCO2 ETH0 goes to Switch 2 port 48\n There is a fibre connection between the two HP switches just carrying the VLAN for the WAN connections. This is done via a HP LACP trunk and STP.\n Each of the HP Switches then has a connection to two internal fibre switches on an LACP Trunk carrying just the Management VLAN only. To allow access for managing the switches etc.\n We then have a port configured on each switch to uplink to our Watchguard HA Firewalls for WAN VLAN\n Basically the issue is when the two ISP WAN connections are connected to the required HP switch port 48 our end it creates a loop and kills the network. If I leave loop protect enabled it will block the port, then unblock, then block and cause issues.\n So essentially it's blocking the link to one of the ISP routers ports that's dedicated for the WAN uplink.\n I have tried putting the WAN ports on a HP Trunk as untagged and still it kills the network ports and then connectivity.\n ​\n I'm running out of ideas currently.

They want to do an ad-hoc network that will support up to 300 wireless clients at a time. The use case is simply to provide public wifi to check emails, browse, social media, etc. The AP/switching/routing portion is pretty easily accomplished. We plan on implementing client isolation, of course, and bandwidth limiting each client to about 2 Mbps. So total throughput really would only need to be 600Mbps if all devices were running full tilt.\n They want to use cellular to connect to WAN, and so my first thought was Cradlepoint. Specifically looking at this one https://cradlepoint.com/product/endpoints/w1850-series/ . The data sheet states that it can do 2 Gbps passthrough... so im assuming this is factoring in download AND upload. But for anyone that actually uses these things.... are you getting ANYWHERE near that speed? I understand that not all devices are created equal... but I have a 5g modem for traveling and it gets around 20Mbps... my cell phone gets around 2.\n This would be in the seattle metro area so coverage from all carriers is excellent in most places.

          "description": "Hello! I know, I know... Unifi, bleh... But still, does anyone know how Unifi's IP conflict detection works under the hood?\n ​\n The scenarios are that Unifi switches and access points are being used. In no case is a Unifi gateway being used and so some other DHCP server is being used, either firewall of a different vendor or Windows Server.\n ​\n The reason I ask is because, while the feature of IP conflict detection is certainly useful and certainly sometimes correct, it also seems to be sometimes erroneous. \n ​\n For example, sometimes there will be an alert for an IP conflict, and thorough checking is done and through manual checking there does not appear to be an actual conflict. \n ​\n In another example, sometimes it will alert that there is an IP conflict on X subnet, but not specify which IP it detected in conflict. In what scenario would a Unifi switch or AP be able to detect \"a\" conflict but not a specific IP that is in conflict? \n ​\n Anyway, I could guess what mechanisms and logic are being used for IP conflict detection, but it would be helpful to know actual fact as to what's triggering the alerts, to help identify if it is an erroneous detection or to help track down the offending device(s). In many cases the networks are far away and being managed remotely, so just going onsite and tracking things down physically is not always an option.\n ​\n I've searched online but was not able to find much of any information at all about the internal workings of this feature.

The x-connect is showing up up and the NPEs vfi are showing up as well. It seems all vfis and x-connects peers are up but I'm not seeing the upes exchanging their mac's or mac's in the bridge-domain of the NPEs. I've tried pinging end to end to watch / capture icmp debugs and wireshark analyze the traffic but once the traffic from the CPE enters the UPE I don't see any icmp traffic. I've also tried debugging the ingress and egress node with no luck with the various combinations.\n At this point I have no clue what to try next or if the virtual nodes in my cml lab (ios17.03) support H-vpls redundancy. I know that virtual images may have some difficulty imitating l2 traffic. Also the documentation for this topic is sparse so even knowing what to troubleshoot or debug is a nightmare.\n I'm open to suggestions and even recommendations for books about l2vpn Cisco support.\n Here's the doc I am trying to following along with (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr920/configuration/guide/mpls/17-1-1/b-mp-l2-vpns-xe-17-1-asr920/m_mp-hvpls-npe-red-mpls-access_asr920.html)\n    submitted by    /u/Brief_Meet_2183  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was looking at a redesign of the network where I work. I work in the Energy sector and we have multiple methods of communication across a large regional area of states in the USA. We currently have a mixture of BGP and OSPF routing protocols with route redist at several places in the network. The more the network grows and the more \"routing rules\" we put in place, the more I think that just going BGP full stack all through the network is a good idea. The issue I have with going forward is that not EVERYBODY on the network staff is fully proficient in BGP routing, and its easy to just slap OSPF on interfaces for them. My issue is that if prefix lists for redistribution are not followed and updated properly, then it still causes issues routing from BGP to OSPF or vice versa anyway. We might as well just BGP it all and attach route preferences using BGP attributes such as weight, path prepending and local preference. \n ​\n I also think I could make things a bit easier to roll traffic using community values that would be propagated through the entire BGP environment, and use some of those values for path selections and ease of rolling traffic when I get it all scripted for those who may not be as proficient with BGP. My thought was that it would be easier for those folks just to maybe change a community value in one edge router to roll internet traffic, and have all other routers in the environment follow the rules attached to that community value. Hopefully that makes sense. I don't want to over complicate things, but honestly, things are getting more complicated just in the redistribution of routes that are happening today anyhow. It just keeps getting worse the more we grow.\n ​\n Thanks,\n B\n    submitted by    /u/bardsleyb  \n [link]   [comments]",

We need to make sure our length test is within 1KM as we need this data to choose what dispersion compensation module we need.\n We have an OTDR but really the main question I have - which seems to have very fuzzy answers out there - is what length launch cable I need for testing an 80KM span. I get answers like “1000M, 2000M or maybe 4000M” - but no good way to calculate it, except by using pulse width, but even that isn’t clear on what the best pulse width should be.\n Any tips on the following would be appreciated:\n launch cable length? do I really need a receive cable, and if so, what length? pulse width settings?

For networking professionals I've spoken to in the service provider space I've heard the same sentiment with Juniper often replacing Cisco as the big bad.\n I don't want to know the name of your company, just curious if there is any talk of either going Whitebox for the additonal buildout of the network or even a plan to completely rip out Cisco or Juniper in a lattered approach over the next 3-5 years as an example.\n ​\n thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Educational-Coyote83  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’ve posted about this before, but I’m back with more answers but still no resolution. Long story short, Apple devices spoof their MAC by default. Each time the client roams from one WAP to the next (even under the same SSID) the mac address changes. In theory, this sounds great! \n Here’s my problem, each time the MAC address changes a new DHCP request is sent. At smaller facilities this typically doesn’t cause much issue. However, at our larger facilities this is causing our DHCP pool to run out of IPs. \n In an attempt to free up IP space, I’ve turned the DHCP lease time down to 1 minute and increased that network to a /22. On average, this network has around 150 users, at its busiest around 200. My attempt to relieve the issue worked for about 2 hours, then the DHCP pool was full again. \n Think about it this way, if 1 person walks across the facility and passes 10 WAPs with their phone in their pocket, they’ve just leased 10 different IPs. Now imagine 150 people constantly running around a hospital. \n I’ve been racking my brain over this for months, and without implementing an MDM I don’t think there’s much we can do. Thoughts?

Unfortunately we use a firewall which requires licenses for VPN connections.\n Is my thinking wrong here? Is there really no need for remote users to use any kind of VPN when performing their job function?\n The first thing my mind goes to is a MOTM attack on some shitty insecure coffee shop wifi, or poor browsing habits leading to someone's device being compromised.

Unfortunately some of the sites I visit don’t have a spare network port in the office for me to connect to. \n My current solution is to carry a 5-port Ethernet switch, and jump-in between one of the existing computers - connecting the switch to the wall outlet, and the existing computer and my laptop to the switch. It works well. However, a 5-port switch is bulky, it also has a wall-wart, which I need to plug in, many sites don’t have a spare power port either, so I carry a power-board which I put between the existing power and one of their devices… yes everything works, but it is a lot of equipment to carry around, and since I will usually only be at the site for a day, it is a pain unpacking and packing up etc.\n If there was a USB-powered switch it would reduce the need to carry a wall-wart and power board (my laptop easily lasts the day on battery, so power for it isn’t a concern), or even better, a USB Ethernet adapter with integrated switch, since I need to carry a USB Ethernet adapter anyway. Then I could just piggy-back in between an existing computer and the wall outlet.\n Anyone know of such a beast? I have googled, and not found anything, but maybe my search terms are wrong.\n Edit. Since many are saying to refer to Corp IT, our corporate IT are aware of the situation, and their recommended solution is “go to a computer store and buy a cheap switch”. They are happy for us to do it, because it is cheaper for the few mobile staff to do that, than for them to get extra outlets wired in at each site that has hit capacity. This is about getting a switch that is smaller and more portable than the typical budget 5 port switch.\n    submitted by    /u/AequidensRivulatus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently built a lab for testing a redundant edge router deployment for a service provider environment. Initially, I used EVPN ESI LAG with virtual gateway address but also have a lab using VRRP instead. I have found a major roadblock in deploying IPv6 in these environments: there is no state redundancy for DHCPv6-PD. The routers I am using serve as DHCPv6 relays and my CPE uses DHCPv6-PD to request prefixes. The relays snoop the DHCPv6 process and dynamically build routing information to the requestor CPE’s WAN address for the delegated prefix. However, this state is only ever built on one edge router or the other, meaning if one of the routers fails, all routing state for the prefixes delegated via DHCPv6-PD is lost. Even though I have a redundant PE, the redundancy is useless.\n This blew my mind that there was no mechanism for hot-standby of the DHCPv6 relay state. I found an article that Huawei switches apparently have such a mechanism, but looks proprietary.\n I found an ipSpace blog post from over 10 years ago on this topic: https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/03/do-we-need-dhcpv6-relay-redundancy.html\n Anyone found a solution to this problem?\n    submitted by    /u/farmer_kiwi  \n [link]   [comments]",

The transcievers are 100G-SR specification and needs OM4 duplex fibre according to cisco docs.\n To the questions... The trunk cable between the patch panels I've been told is 'crossover' which i assume is reverse type B therefore.\n My understanding is then the patch leads could be polarity A (straight through) or Polarity B (reversed).\n For devices that are DIRECTLY connecting in the cabinet (not through patch panel) they would need to use polarity B (reverse) however.\n Am i being stupid or misunderstanding this! I only know it's crossover trunk and it's male.

However, managing these devices can be challenging, as they are often used by multiple people and may be exposed to a variety of security risks.\n Problem that businesses face:\n The following are some of the problems that businesses face when managing shared Android devices:\n  \nSecurity: Shared Android devices are at risk of being lost, stolen, or tampered with. This can lead to the unauthorized access of corporate data or the installation of malware.\n Compliance: Businesses must comply with a variety of regulations, such as data protection laws and industry standards. Managing shared Android devices can be difficult to do in a way that meets all of these compliance requirements.\n Cost: Managing shared Android devices can be expensive, as businesses need to purchase and maintain the devices, as well as the software and services needed to manage them.\n  \nSolution to their problem:\n There are a number of solutions that businesses can use to manage shared Android devices. These solutions include:\n  \nMobile device management (MDM) software: MDM software can be used to remotely manage shared Android devices. This includes features such as remote wipe, password policies, and app management..\n Containerization: Containerization is a technique that can be used to isolate corporate data from personal data on shared Android devices. This helps to protect corporate data from unauthorized access.\n Bring your own device (BYOD): BYOD allows employees to use their own personal devices for work. This can help to reduce the cost of managing shared Android devices.\n  \nLearn more about Managing Shared Android Devices here!\n    submitted by    /u/ResponsibleHardship  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is the website I'm reading from: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/modeling-labs/index.html#~licensing \n Personal - Single use only.

Will I be able to call someone and they can help me if I get stuck in a lab? I doubt it. Maybe it means they support in the setting up of the VM and installing the software?\n Higher Education:\n - I work at a university. Would this mean I can use this type of CML? Why would I choose this over enterprise? The site says it licenses for concurrent users instead of nodes. This makes me think enterprise works like this: you have license for 20 nodes.

User 3 logs in and has no nodes to use until the other 2 users shut their labs down. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Dunce-Learner  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's the situation:\n I have a packet coming from a client within my subnet (let's call it Subnet A), but it's intended for a server with a public IP address outside Subnet A. I want to translate the destination address of the packet, so that my router directs it to a private IP address within Subnet A instead.\n I've been trying to figure out how to accomplish this, but I'm not quite sure which NAT feature or configuration would be suitable for my case. I've explored options like \"Virtual Server\" and \"Port Forwarding,\" but they seem to be geared towards incoming packets from outside the subnet.\n I've read about Destination NAT but I checked the 5 different routers I have available at the office and none of them support DNAT. I've seen on the internet that some people use routers that work with line commands instead of an HMI interface, but I also don't have one of those.\n Can anyone guide me on how to achieve this translation within my network?

I'm trying to get a single Palo Alto VM Series running in Azure, and I know Palo's pretty well but my Azure skills come and go as I don't use it all the time so I'm trying to get past the cloud specific nuances to be able to hit the mgmt IP via HTTPS and get to the normal firewall config stuff. I do understand azure basics like VNET's related to Subnet's which associate to Route tables and how UDR's are needed often times or inter-vnet connections, etc.\n My main issue is when I went to deploy the NGFW this time in Azure, I only have public subnet, Private subnet, and public IP. I remember and see in older documentation there was a management subnet to configure as well but I don't see that currently when configuring one.\n So my question is.... given the context that I just want to get a basic Palo up and running and reach it via mgmt.... not even worried about the nat stuff or data plane route tables and whatnot in azure yet..... what is the easiest method to do this? I can't seem to find a good guide or video on it... and I know it shouldn't be a process that technically needs one anyway, simple concept but I'm just not sure what to do next. Any help is appreciated and will be gifted with all the upvotes I have to gift. No gold because I'm mad about the API changes killing my RIF app though.\n ​\n Edit: and for the record if the public IP is what I'm supposed to be hitting, no dice currently, and there's no NSG associated with it.... if that public IP is the answer..... maybe I need to figure out how it relates to a route table and make a 0.0.0.0/0 to internet or something. but anyway, point still stands...

We're ruling that out due to signal strength being poor in the location at the best of times, and once you add in a significant audience, we wouldn't want to rely on it.\n They're approx. 50m from a nearby building, so we're probably within spec to just run a long piece of Cat6A through the window from an existing data point, but this cable will need to share containment with mains power (240V/50Hz), and so I think there may be both technical and regulatory issues with this? I don't want this to fail an electrical inspection just before the event and lead us to have to frantically replan.\n My two main thoughts are fibre from an existing switch in a ground floor room, or P2P Wireless, with a preference for fibre (for cost reasons as we'll always re-use SFP modules and switches, but P2P kit is less likely to find any future use for us.)\n Has anyone done anything similar?\n If fibre is the answer, what level of armouring/ruggedising is necessary?

Here are the details of the setup and topology\n https://imgur.com/a/WHVlUf0\n ​\n  \nPhysical connectivity: HQ Campus, datacenter Silicon Valley, and datacenter Seattle are connected via dark fiber on Nexus 9K switches.\n EIGRP: The Nexus 9K switches in each location (SE-SW, SV-SW, HQ-SW) are running EIGRP to exchange routes internally.\n BGP: BGP is configured on the Nexus 9K switches for external routing. In Seattle, the Nexus switch (SE-SW) has a BGP peering with a Fortigate Firewall (SE-FGT) on AS 65010. In Silicon Valley, the Nexus switch (SV-SW) has a BGP peering with a Fortigate Firewall (SV-FGT) on AS 65011.\n Redistribution: The firewalls (SE-FGT and SV-FGT) are learning the 172.22.1.0/24 network from their respective Nexus switches (SE-SW and SV-SW) through EIGRP redistribution.\n Partner1: Both Fortigate Firewalls (SE-FGT and SV-FGT) have a BGP peering with Partner1, which advertises the 10.0.0.0/24 network.\n  \nNow, here are my questions:\n  \nDo I need to configure iBGP between SE-SW and SV-SW? Both Nexus switches are already exchanging routes via EIGRP redistribution, so is iBGP necessary in this case?\n Is it necessary to configure BGP peering between SE-FGT and SV-FGT?

Their existing design is that they are terminating all their ISPs in the Fortigate & from there they are getting a LAN network (10.3.70.0/23 - Gateway:- 10.3.70.1) to an unmanaged switch. They have few servers on that switch & from that switch they are giving uplink to other unmanaged access switches. My work here is to configure a Core switch(9300L) which will have VLANs for Data & Voice & will handle all the inter-vlan routing & DHCP request as well as default route to the Gateway (FW). Easy, but the catch is that i can not touch the Fortigate firewall or change anything there. \n  \nIf i divide the /23 network into two /24 network, will there be any issue in the FW?\n \nIs there any way that can i put the servers on Data vlan(10.3.70.0/24) without changing their subnet mask?\n \nCan i terminate the LAN from the FW to Core in the Data vlan as an access port or is there a better way.\n \n If you have any good suggestions than feel free to let me know. \n *Sorry for the lengthy post.

The firmware file I received worked fine on the first three, but the last two are saying that the calculated md5 hash doesn't match the embedded md5 hash, and so they won't use it. I've tried with both 17.6.5 and 17.9.3. (I tried the 17.9.3 first, because it was what I was given, and after that didn't work, I thought to ask for the 17.6.5 as an intermediate step.) I've tried multiple downloads of each, but keep getting the same error.\n Now, not being a habitual Cisco person, I've been using the web gui to do these updates. I am well aware more netadmins prefer to use the cli, but I am just not good at the Cisco cli, so I avoid it. If there is something in the cli that I can use rather than the web gui, I'm willing to try it. I just don't know enough about the cli to know what to try right now. \n As for going to my corporate net admins, they are overloaded, and don't respond to tickets for months, so I can't really do much there.

Purchased 2 SFP+ MM Fiber 10Gbit fiber modules along with a 10Gbit MM fiber cable. Running a Unifi US-48-500W switch (Flow control/Jumbo Frames enabled). SFP+ Modules & MM fiber cable go directly from server SPF+ Port to SFP+ Port on switch.\n Windows shows full 10Gbit connection (Verified in Device Management that \"Speed and Duplex\" are set to \"10Gbps Full Duplex\") and Unifi Shows a 10Gbit connection in the console.\n We have 2 main NAS's configured in 802.3ad LACP (One Synology DS416 and one WD EX4100 both with RAID 5 4x 8TB drives) Both show 2000Mbps connections.\n T430 has 8x 8TB Drives and when copying a file (Not through network) from RAID to SSD boot drive, achieves ~360MBytes. So I know the RAID is at least capable of those speeds.\n Copying files from RAID to either single NAS averages around 110MBytes. I understand that LAG does not increase transfer speeds for single client as it will just use one connection technically.\n However, when trying to transfer data from the server to both NAS's, the Server NIC pegs out at 1GBit. Both NAS's should be able to take at least 1Gbit each and the server should be putting out 2GBits total.\n Also tried copying one file from Server to NAS and copying another file from Server to Desktop PC at the same time. Originally transfers around 100MBps and as soon as the 2nd file transfer starts, the server file transfer speeds are split between the two to about 50MBps each.\n Thoughts/Idea's anyone?\n    submitted by    /u/WorldlyFeature5282  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm no expert in that field but ideally shouldn't we have some logs about all the configurations in the router?

The thing is, let's say that there's a 1 second spike in the traffic, but no one was paying attention at the time and only realized it few minutes later.

The problem I am trying to solve with this, is that this requires a switch per device since these switches we are using only have 2 or 4 ports on. One port for the 192.168.1.0 IP and one for the IT Routable subnet. What I am wanting is either a fix to this without re-IPing the machines but a more central device that can handle the NAT's. I am thinking a 48 port switch that I can basically NAT the machine IP's in mass? Anyone got Ideas? If I am completely missing an easy solution please no hate.\n ​\n EDIT:: So the IE-2000, Could I implement that back at the Network cabinet and terminate all of the devices needing connected to it then have one uplink port to the OT Network and configure L2NAT instances for each interface?\n    submitted by    /u/ryguy6011  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Earlier post asking about V6 adoption. Dinosaur here, recollecting that the big issue for adoption late-90s early 2000s was that the design/policy was that enterprise V6 allocations were only from an ISP, there would be no Provider-Independent allocations. (I think this was because v4 routing tables were outpacing router memory at the time. Having ISP allocation allowed greater summarization) Naturally there was a storm every time this policy was brought up on NANOG. If one wanted to have more than one upstream for resiliency, there would be two entirely separate V6 address spaces. So a complex protocol came out of the Network Working Group: RFC 5533, Shim-6: Multi-homing Shim Protocol. When the policy was inevitably changed to PI allocations I felt so sorry for the folks who must have spent many meetings working out the Shim Protocol. PI address space allocation was the beginning of the long adoption process.\n    submitted by    /u/blahblahcat7  \n [link]   [comments]",

So for instance in the case of subnet A I get: log₂(13) = 3.7 --> and rounding up I find that I need 4 bits.\n Then I take the number of bits and adjust the subnet mask accordingly, so again in the case of subnet A instead of using /25 I would use /28 (because the 4 LSB are 0)\n Now I want to find the range of IPs for the subnet, so for subnet A I will start from 129.19.40.1 (since .0 is reserved) and go til 129.19.40.14.

We're doing this about 2-3 times a week. I find this is somewhat \"low value\" work I'm wondering if others push this to their facilities team and only interface in this work as a point of escalation?\n Some of the drawbacks to doing this:\n  \nStaff are fickle, things change and a single site visit can turn into multiple\n \nStuff changes, cabling can be installed as requested, and then a project changes its mind and the desks are now on the other side of the room\n \nSometimes with this work, you become a defacto project manager because the cabling is in the critical path\n \nThere are only so many hours in the day while doing this work... you're not deploying new kit or working on audits and cleanups\n \nThis process is followed by our Junior and Senior Engineers alike\n \n    submitted by    /u/ineedtolistenmore  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm going to give a very simplified version of the problem I am trying to solve, for simplicity purposes.\n I hope that the smart people here can help me out so that I don't need to buy and install additional copper NICs.\n We are in the midst of a network re-design so I am trying to make do with what we have at this current time to try to make my new server function. In a nutshell, I want to combine what used to be two copper access ports from two physically separate networks to a single SFP connection which my new server has, and assign them to my VMs by VLAN. \n Old scenario:\n I have an old server that had 2 copper NICs each connected to respectively 2 physically separate networks. The access ports come from Cisco 2960X without VLANs configured. At this time, it is not possible to have these reconfigured.\n On the server, NIC1/Network 1 was attached to VM1, and NIC2/Network 2 was attached to VM2.\n This has worked fine for years.\n New scenario:\n I have a new server that only has 1 SFP port.\n Is there a way I can combine or (reverse) trunk these two networks so that my new server can see either network depending on what VLAN I assign to each VM?\n I tried to create two access ports, Port1 on VLAN10 for Network 1, and Port 2 on VLAN 20 for Network 2. I then connected Port 24 (SFP Trunk) to my new server. This didn't seem to work.\n I have been toying with the scenario and it doesn't work. I know I must be doing something silly, but I feel like there should be a way to make it functional.\n I have a diagram drawn up of my test design but I can't seem to upload it yet as I might be too new.\n Hope someone can help!\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/lxjosh1234  \n [link]   [comments]",
