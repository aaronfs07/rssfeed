During incident response activities, CISA uncovered that likely multiple APT groups compromised the organization’s network, and some APT actors had long-term access to the environment. APT actors used an open-source toolkit called Impacket to gain their foothold within the environment and further compromise the network, and also used a custom data exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to steal the victim’s sensitive data.\nThis joint Cyb…",

It's running as a DC, a file server, and there's an Access database that clients access through some program installed on the workstations. There're two client workstations that can't have the program installed and so have to access the database directly on the server. Their previous IT set up RDS but never installed licenses; they just kept renewing the trial. We've had to fix a lot of how the previous IT did things and we are trying to get licensing for the two workstations that need to RDP into the server to access the database. I believe you can have the RDS session host and the RDS licensing manager on the same box, but correct me if I'm wrong. Can I use 2022 Server CALs for this situation or do I have to use Server 2016 CALs?\n    submitted by    /u/imgoingtomissmyhouse  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello fellow sysadmins,\n I'm looking for recommendations of and experiences with Linux antivirus options for on-premise company servers. We already use Symantec on our Windows servers and clients, and while it has a Linux version, it lags behind in supporting recent Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04) and it doesn't play nice with containers. We have a bunch of Ubuntu servers at various locations running QEMU/KVM virtualization, Docker (in VM), Kubernetes (nodes in VMs) und LXD containers (on bare metal) backed by local ZFS storage.\n We're looking for an option that is capable of dealing with containers, so that we'd only need to install the AV on hosts and VMs, and that offers sensible licensing/pricing, ideally per physical server instead of full price per install or at least reduced price for a VM install. Centralized management would be nice but not a requirement, log and/or mail based alerts would suffice. Needless to say we require good detection rates, timely signature updates and the capability to prevent the execution of malware. The main threat scenarios are malware getting on the servers either via compromised clients, exposed vulnerable services (hello Atlassian) or supply chain compromise (hello npm).\n The state of AV websites is a sad affair, with a general lack of clear statements about capabilities and business licensing options and costs (its all \"Contact us!\"), thus I turn to you.\n    submitted by    /u/zravo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had the interview this past Monday-nailed my interview including the interview with the V.P. However, I made it clear that I had other interviews that week and could not formally respond until Friday. Another job offered me $28 or $56,160 a year. I called back Job A, recruiter was kind and asked me how my other interviews went. I said great and thanked him for being patient, I said another job offered $28 and wanted to see if they could match it. I stressed that I really wanted to work with them. He asked if I’d take anything lower so I said $27. This is about a $4K difference than their original offer. Normally I wouldn’t negotiate but I feel I’m the perfect person for the role-they actually sought me out from a job site-hounded me for about two weeks for an interview. They ended up offering me the role hours after my interview. My question is, did I screw up? If they reject my counteroffer, can I go back to their original offer? I didn’t make the counteroffer as a non-negotiable, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask. He said the latest I should be hearing back is early next week. I wouldn’t start this job until Nov 7, after my two weeks notice with my current company so the delayed acceptance is not an issue.\n    submitted by    /u/NessaC12  \n [link]   [comments]",

Don't ask about it.\n This week, Microsoft 365 just disabled Basic Auth from our tenant.\n So, if you are using Schemus (their sync tool) and syncing from Exchange Online (EXO), app passwords won't work anymore. \n Worked with Broadcom's support. Surprinsingly, so far so good. \n Support adviced to:\n - upgrade Schemus to latest downloadable version ( Schemus Synchronization Tool – Mandatory Upgrade (broadcom.com) ) and apply a support-supplied patch. This will enable Microsoft Graph as a source and enables usage of Exchange Online Cert-based auth.\n - Install Powershell 7.03+ plus EXO v3. If using Server 2012 R2 (like me...don't ask again) you need to create a config file so Schemus knows where to look for PoSh 7.\n - Configure an App Registration in Azure AD to allow to authenticate against EXO with a certificate (CBA, App-only authentication in Exchange Online PowerShell and Security & Compliance PowerShell | Microsoft Learn )\n - Reconfigure Schemus to use EXO CBA. \n - And that's it...supposedly.\n Why supposedly? Well, seems like Schemus still uses EXO v1 \"get-recipient\" and that causes a timeout for us for just the \"user\" sync part (which is optional, but we use it). I managed to reproduce that error and compared against \"get-EXOrecipient\", which worked fine. Already told them that, so I guess we will have to wait for another patch from Broadcom's developer, Metanate (the one who develops Schemus).\n Hopefully this will help others who are stuck with Broadcom's stuff.\n    submitted by    /u/dfctr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some VPNs require additional configurations (f.ex. setting routes/DNS manually), some not. And we have plenty of technologies: OpenVPN, L2TP/IPSec, FortiClient VPN, Cisco, …\n As some are using Linux, some Windows, some macOS – there are always troubles setting the VPN's up.\n We first started using OpenConnect, which supports a lot of different VPN services. But we had the problem that some configurations did not apply correctly and that some IDS systems detected this and it was forbidden by the IT.\n So: I'm looking for a way how my co-workers easily can connect to the different VPN's. I'm currently thinking of creating an RDS Server for each customer with everything preconfigured, authenticated by a certificate – or maybe something with Amazon WorkSpaces. But I think there must be a better solution to this.\n How do you handle this? Do you have an idea how we could gain some efficiency instead of a long on-boarding process and big documentations? It can be a technical solution, as we're mostly developers, system engineers or similar.\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ubhz-ch  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Currently our company has a weekly rotation of technicians who end up on call. Last night I had about 6 alerts come in from one location. It was about 1.5 hours of afterhours work and then it was resolved at about 11:00 PM.\n Later throughout the night, I had two more alerts come in around 1:45 and 3:00 AM that were short term disruptions that resolved themselves. In addition, I had two clients call in at 3:00 AM and then 5:00 AM about their VPN connection not operating. I missed these two calls, and my manager is furious with me because \"that is what is expected of the on-call person.\"\n Is it reasonable to expect someone who receives alerts like this, respond to them throughout the night and be expected to start work at 8:00AM the next day and work a full 8-hour shift? Yes, we do get additional compensation for the week of being on call, but my thinking is that setting these expectations is what results in mistakes being made and on the job injuries. I'm not saying that you shouldn't work the next day but expecting someone to be up and running first thing and being sleep deprived is not a healthy thing.\n Am I wrong for thinking about it this way? What are your thoughts on this or what expectations does your company set?\n    submitted by    /u/No_Interest_5818  \n [link]   [comments]",

They also want to make it so screens don't lock automatically, and want to use a single shared account for all the public workstations (meeting rooms and such) instead of logging in with their own account or bringing a laptop for presentations.\n Basically C-Suite says: I want all the computers to be unlocked and working before I get near them\n But my experience says: 2FA everything, lock every screen after 10-20 minutes of no activity, detect and disconnect mouse jigglers if needed, and always use unique accounts even at public kiosks\n This company is constantly under attack from phishing/spoofing and can't afford to pay for better M365 tiers to mitigate it. One of the IT Directors used the password Passwerd2020 a couple years ago, and the pen tester was able to use that account to find and access a full AD backup (don't have more detail on this, but it was bad).\n Seems they should be freaking out about how bad their security is, instead the execs are just trying to poke more convenience holes.

          "description": "Has anyone else seen office 365, word excel etc lock up temporarily because it is searching for printer. However, at times the printer is not always available because the person is mobile, not in the office, and not connected to the VPN. \n We can reproduce the issue regularly by going onto a network that doesn't have permission to the print serve, open word, and edit margins. Word then locks up while searching for the printer (which it can't find the default printer because they are not on the VPN or Network with permission to the printer). Eventually times out and seems to remember the time out for that session of word. It does cause other delays also\n Others are saying they get around it by setting a default printer to the local PDF writer but that isn't really the best option. \n It seems office is trying to connect to get the page setup information from the printer. Is there a setting somewhere to change this behavior. We are kind of stumped at the moment.\n    submitted by    /u/lost028  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long nights migrating servers or rewiring entire buildings, come in after zero sleep for \"one tiny thing\" and still get chewed out by the Executive's assistant about it. Ask someone to follow a process and make a ticket before grabbing me in a hallway and you'd think I killed their cat.\n Our pay scales are out of wack, every company is just looking to undercut IT salaries because we \"make too much\". So no one talks about it except on Glassdoor because we don't want to find out the guy who barely does anything makes 10x my salary.\n Our responsibilities are usually not clearly defined, training is on our own time, unpaid overtime is 'normal', and we have to take abuse from many sides. \"Other duties as needed\" doesn't mean I know how to fix the HVAC.\n Would a Worker's Union be beneficial to SysAdmins/DevOps/IT/IS?

Sending email from the GMail web UI didn't do this. Now, some ten minutes or so later, I tried again from Thunderbird and there was a flicker of a pause, but nothing like before.

Not consistently, it can usually ping the DCs in its domain and in the forest root above it. But the lookups tend to be slow. And many other servers in the domain don't resolve.\n I've done a netsh winsock reset and a reboot, which I thought fixed it (I could resolve a hostname that wasn't previously working) but just seems to have made it a little better, not fixed it altogether. I've removed the virtual NIC and put a new one in. I've switched temporarily to DHCP. The issue persists. It's using the two domain controllers as DNS servers, the same as every other server in that domain, and they're all fine.\n \"Test-Netconnection DC1 -p 53\" connects successfully (as does DC2).\n If I do an nslookup for anything, it finds it. But if I immediately ping it, chances are, it won't resolve the name.\n Name resolution fails regardless of whether I just search for the NETBIOS name or the FQDN.

With a good bump to my salary. As smaller MSPs are, I've got a rather broad spectrum of skills but I am no master in a lot of those. Well, that may be knocking myself a bit down, but you get the gist.\n My new employer put me into a department that will also be focused on providing managed services with some focus on cloudy stuff as well as even providing private cloud instances to customers. I am destined to be a network-guy (but it could change to something else if it fits, I am pretty open to other positions), which fits the focus of my previous position, but with a lot of focus to newer technologies like software defined networking / SD-WAN and the like which I have pretty much no clue about. (Well, I setup a vxlan peering on my proxmox-homelab-cluster and connected three VMs with it, but that's about it :-D)\n I guess I made a good impression and I was pretty honest about this lack of knowledge on my part, so there will probably be provided training at the start and I will not be expected to have this knowledge. I think I showed enough willingness to learn new stuff and general interest in IT to be a future asset to my employer.\n Be that as it may, tldr, I'd love to read up and learn about the newer network-concepts like SDN/SD-WAN and stuff in this direction but I am not sure where to start exactly. Can someone point me in the right direction? Or maybe recommend some good papers/videos about this stuff? I'd like not to focus on a specific manufacturer, but if they provide good content I don't mind.\n Thank you very, very much!\n New_Leek_102\n    submitted by    /u/New_Leek_102  \n [link]   [comments]",

Two days later I finally get a response that the disk is fine... but something is wrong with the (out of warranty) device. They want me to sign a new 3 year agreement and they'll give me a free box (I'm on the cusp of not wanting to work with this MSP anymore so a commitment is not high on my list!).

Google meet obviously for the google meetings, Apple TV for mirroring the iPads when nobody is joining remotely, and the PC for all other meeting solutions that don't work with Google Meet. Since it's budget time we're looking for an all-in-one solution for joining meetings and the Smart board 6000s Pro seems like a pretty legit solution but I just don't know anybody who's actually used it. According to the product page it can join all of the major video conferencing platforms, and supports AirPlay mirroring, so it would wipe out all of the extra we have and users wouldn't have to change much. Does it have a lot of hardware compatibility in terms of webcams? Is it easy for users to use? Does it give a good experience when using it on all of the different meeting platforms?

When changing from one day to the next at one point Outlook will not draw the bottom part of the calendar and wherever you click Outlook will click that amount of cells not rendered up or down. See screenshot for the example, I clicked in the blank space but the selection was above my click. https://imgur.com/a/KxOkHv6\n Initially I thought this was an Azure Virtual Machine issue but I have since been able to recreate it on a physical machine as well. I have tried the latest Office beta but the issue persists. I have reinstalled Office, recreated the profile, used Online only mode, tried the reg key to disable hardware acceleration, tried different hardware, tried different accounts. At this point I don't know what else to try and suspect it is a flaw in Office because I have seen this with a different user who has reproduced it in Excel workbooks that have formulas that changes the display while it is running.\n I have a open ticket with MS on this but I thought I would ask here as well.

          "description": "Hi Everyone,\n Our main corporate location has been suffering from a rather annoying issue for almost a year now. We have a 600 user office in the midwestern United States. The trouble is, Google is classifying our public IP addresses as being in Brazil. This is rather annoying for our users, as search results return the Brazilian versions of websites as well as the search results appearing in Portuguese.\n We can easily switch the search results to English, but the Brazilian websites still appear as first results.\n Normally you can enable the browser to detect your location (probably also through public IP), however we have an Edge group policy disabling this. We are unable to enable this due to security concerns (even though every website can view our public IP anyways).\n Ultimately it looks like the issue is an incorrect location mapping in Google’s geo-cache. I have submitted multiple automated requests to get this updated (using this: https://support.google.com/websearch/workflow/9308722?hl=en). However after around 50 submissions over various months, nothing has changed.\n We are a full Microsoft shop with no Google products (so no line of sight to any direct Google support). Looking up our public IP’s using ARIN show the correct address information. Other browser and IP based location services also correctly identify our location.\n Has anyone ever ran into this issue or have any ideas on how to remediate it? I know it’s nothing on our computers because Google correctly identifies the IP location of our remote users and all of our other offices. Unfortunately it is this one office with the issue.\n    submitted by    /u/jspang16  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've added rules and tweaked the logic on the ticket system to require people to reply to tickets if I've replied to them (7 days from my reply, ticket automatically closed).\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/orion3311  \n [link]   [comments]",

The security team is not super tech savvy to put it nicely , but will just log into server and make changes not knowing what they are doing. An example it logging into Windows servers and stop/disabling the firewall service. They seem to be making all the decisions for the enterprise environment, software to use or not use. I am not talking like we will not allow some software because we see it as a security issue which is actually their job, but like running the evaluation of major software like Okta (which i like by the way) then buying it and forcing it on the rest of IT without their testing or input. They seem to spec out the hardware not just say ever device needs to be from proper sources and have TPM etc. But they have no idea about hardware or how it works. They are opposed to anything open source which kills me. I am very cautious about open source, but sometimes it just is needed. To many example for non open source vendors with huge security issues that they don't fix or disclose. Security by obscurity. They love to hold everyone's feet to the fire about change control but do impacting things without using the change board, nor notifying the impacted persons. Like someday getting an e-mail from the application that your admin privileges are gone without any notice. CIO seems to be ok with this. Like cyber is doing all the work on the move the cloud? \n This all seems really backwards for me, but I need perspective. My idea of security it to set policy, weigh in on enforcement changes, set infrastructure goals for the actual sysadmins to move toward a more secure posture, deal with incidents, and stuff like that.

However: \n 1) What would the most \"correct\" approach be? Should we create a subuser and then authenticate domains for each of our customers on this subuser? Sending our customers the SPF record etc. generated by SendGrid.\n 2) We're not all that interested in doing this manually every time a customer asks. Does anyone have experience with using the SendGrid API for authenticating domains? \n I'm a developer (not a Sysadmin), so I'm a bit worried to mess something up. Basically we just want to use our SendGrid account to send emails from different domains (approved by the owners of the domains).\n Could anyone walk me through the correct way to do this?\n I've tried reaching out to SendGrid support, but they just keep sending me to the same \"How authenticated domains work\"-article, which doesn't explain the scenario I'm interested in. \n Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)\n    submitted by    /u/Durandal1984  \n [link]   [comments]",

After multiple years of unimpeded cloud growth, the findings suggest enterprises’ soaring cloud spending may tempered as talks of a looming downturn heat up.\n As organizations move forward with digital transformations they set out on at the beginning of the pandemic, multicloud usage is becoming increasingly unwieldy, and costs are difficult to manage across hybrid environments.\n Furthermore, a wrench has been thrown into IT teams’ plans over the last two quarters in the form of the market tumult. Rising inflation and interest rates, along with fears of a potential recession have put increasing financial and operational strain on organizations.

          "description": "Hi all,\n Since about a year, Microsoft refuses to offer us support through Teams-calls and instead only wants to reach out by phone. For us, having calls over the phone instead of Teams is quite inconvenient as we prefer having multiple team-members on the support call at the same time. Of course, it's possible to have multi-person phone calls, but it's obviously not as optimized as Teams. Also, scheduling Teams-meetings through the calendar in Outlook (which we used to do) instead of 'verbally' by mail brings the added benefit of not having to miss calls because the support-engineer mixed up his timezones. Finally, sharing single screens through Teams is better than being forced to share your entire desktop through Quick Assist.\n Does anybody know why they do this? When we ask, they avoid the question. For us, it's both inconvenient, irritating and strange, because it looks like they deem Teams to be an unsafe way of communicating. Before this, I generally had great experiences with MS Support, but this is just really annoying.\n    submitted by    /u/Hamburgerprins  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Been working with this MNC company who I shall not named for more than a year now. Basically my role is to take care of a POC environment AKA lab manager for their pre & post sales engineers to deploy their respective solutions for demo to their potential customers. The problem is, I have no idea what's going on with my lab and my reporting manager then was too busy to entertain my inquiry, most of the time they outright ignore me.\n After a year for some reason I've been assigned to a new reporting manager who happens to be the principal SA for the lab. Met them privately to discuss my dissatisfaction and what I really want for years to come. In the end they promised to get me involved more in whatever pertaining to the lab and to be frank, I don't buy it. I was right though because so far it's same shit just different person.\n This really demotivates me as I believe what they're doing devalues me as an experienced engineer for 7 years not to mention the jobscope that they promised during the hiring is far from the reality. I'm more than just that guy who holds CMDB for the lab and gives \"consultation\" to presales engineers every single day. Been thinking of jumping ship so far not landing any gig.\n    submitted by    /u/keymochi  \n [link]   [comments]",

When testing LAPS, we have set the name of the administrator account to manage to be RAccess, and were expecting to see the LAPS password applied to that account. What is happening is that the disabled built in administrator account is being re-enabled, renamed to RAccess2 and the LAPS password is being applied to that account. We're rolling out the client via SCCM, and have tried installing it both before and after adding the devices to an OU with LAPS set up. Any ideas where to go next would be appreciated.

I'm wondering what sort of laptops your companies are giving out to users these days? \n We formerly had desktops, but we moved to a new office that the CEO insisted on setting up as a flexible workspace, so everyone needed laptops, and then covid showed up and we went remote.\n We currently have MS Surfaces (the CEO's choice) through a 3rd party vendor. Most people seem to really like them, but I'm getting complaints from a few people that then need more powerful ones. Particularly a few people complain about the amount of ram they come with. I've got a user insisting they need at least 64 GB of ram to work properly, more than is available in a surface. I'm deeply skeptical of this particular user's claim, but that's a different issue. I sent him to his department head to argue with him about getting the budget. If he actually gets budget to buy one, I'll need to source it whether I think he really needs it or not. \n Anyway, what sort of laptops do you all like to send out? How much ram do they typically have?\n    submitted by    /u/DJDoubleDave  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some context:\n I work for a computer refurbishing/resale shop. We operate mostly through online sales and handle hundreds of laptops and desktops a month. I typically am responsible for refurbishing and repairing units for resale.\n We set up a WDS server just running on a local network (not connected publicly) using an old netgear router for handling DHCP to quickly load units. The WDS is configured properly and works , as long as the images are good.\n The issue I run into is sometimes is dism doesnt pull a good image from a unit, and breaks the WDS (Shows no available images if a bad image is present) . It took me a solid 3 weeks to figure out what was going on, but eventually came to the conclusion that if I delete the bad image from the server, then the WDS continues working properly.\n ​\n My question is this,\n Why are some images bad? and how can I fix it? 85% of images I make work flawlessly, while some simply refuse to make a working image. \n Steps taken so far:\n Most recently we got some Dell 7460 AIO's in, around 40 of them. I created an image as I always do, and loaded it on to the server. The issue occurred so I deleted the image and used a different unit to make an image, still no dice. I then tried using dism healthcheck and repair commands, dism sees nothing wrong with the image. I tried using compression on the image to see if that would make a difference. The image is Windows 11 Pro, and the Dell Optiplex 7460 is fully updated. I also tried making a Windows 10 image and that did not work either.\n I'm not sure if there is a correlation but here are some of the other models I cant get a working image for:\n Lenovo T540P\n Dell Latitude 5491\n Lenovo T460\n ​\n I cant understand why the WDS will simply reject some models. I'm hoping someone has some insight.\n ​\n Disclaimer: Ive only been studying and experimenting with networking stuff for the last year, so if there is information missing please feel free to ask.

          "description": "So yesterday I managed to infect myself with this: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e268f2982e14d363e7f7874696d231701234d4b426c3a1bef7271cc0bf766706/summary It came with a very well made, legit looking mail. The main reason why I was so careless is because the sender name was very similar to one of our customers. The virus itself was bundled inside of an img file. We use sophos central email gateway with all bells and whistles enabled - including the sandbox. The mail made it through all of that, windows 11 defender (also with all bells and whistles enabled) didn't catch it either. \n With the help of someone smarter than me we managed to gain access to the ftp server that the virus uses to upload extracted login information. Afterwards we sent an abuse notice to the hoster who immediately deleted all contents and locked the customer out. \n We use the default sophos list for blocked attachment file types (sophos specifically recommends using it instead of making a list on your own!). I'm trying to change that to a whitelist so for example only PDF files are allowed everything else goes into quarantine. But apparently sophos central doesn't even have that option or am I blind?\n    submitted by    /u/Wild-Square1453  \n [link]   [comments]",

The administrator create user accounts and generate an account specific url for account activation. Transmission of the url is the responsibility of the admin.\n To go further, I plan on implementing some SSO methods.\n My guesses are:\n  \ngoogle\n openId\n microsoft AD (this one will be fun to debug, as I never understood windows server XD)\n  \nFinally come the question:\n If you had to sysadmin such a solution, what SSO solution would you expect to find by default ?\n (And to go further, what kind of functionnality would you expect to find out of the box ? )\n ​\n Thank you in advance :)\n    submitted by    /u/Elvandar_Ysalys  \n [link]   [comments]",

Figured there would be a few hiccups, given how thorough (/s) our testing team was. Sure enough got a P1 ticket that they are unable to process files from a system this morning. Turns out they were using sftp to push files up to the old server for one of the data flows.\n So, easy enough fix. Once I was sucked into the P1 group call this morning, I told them exactly what needed to be done. Put in a request to get ssh access to the new server, and here is the new path to the directory. Easy peasy, just like I sent out last week.\n Cut to 6 hours later. The call now has over 20 people on it, including management. They are dissecting all the data flow diagrams, and just ruled out the application server as the issue about an hour ago. Two managers asked me to rejoin the call, and before they could even 'recap' everything they've done so far, I pasted a screenshot of what I told them needed to be done from 6 hours ago, and got dead silence.\n Seems one of the offshore managers (yes, this is ALL coming from our offshore \"support partner\"), stepped in at the end of the call this morning to manage the issue. They are supposedly working on the access requests now and will let me know. In other news, now management wants me to write up an RCA as to the problem, and corrective instructions. Sure, no one read my emails over the last couple weeks warning of this change, they ignored my instructions for the fix this morning, and the still don't seem to fathom what they did wrong.

And are there any security concerns? From a Machine Auth perspective, the user has no business touching the certificate unless they have local administrator rights on the PC (And they don't).\n In this case, the Certificate will be issued to the User itself, so what kind of access do they get to the certificate? Will they be able to possibly export it with a few tweaks even though we issue it as 'non-exportable' from a PKI perspective?

I can get the PIDs from tasklist, but that's just a single point in time. I can get the PID to local port linkage from netstat, but that's also just a single point in time. I could enable process auditing, but our Security event logs already roll over too fast to scope troubleshooting across a full day because of file auditing (Splunk is tightly controlled with a formal change process, so that's out for stretching the log storage in any kind of timely fashion).\n I'm aware I may be able to catch this in ETL format, but my ETW game is weak and limited to: pktmon capture > pktmon etl2pcap > read in Wireshark; I have no experience at all with collecting app data in ETL.\n At the end of the day, I'm just looking for a single tool I can run that can get me these four fields for diagnostic purposes:\n  \n<PID>\n <Process Name>\n <Source IP>:<Source Port>\n <Destination IP>:<Destination Port>\n  \n   submitted by    /u/SevaraB  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys,\n we are a medium sized dev company. As of today, any application is developed in our own tenant. Devs are able to register new apps, grant (most) delegated permissions and start hacking away (loosely speaking).\n There are a couple of issues I see with that approach:\n  \nApps grant permissions to production data.\n Bugs or misuse can lead to data loss.\n App credential stealing can lead to data loss and leaks.\n Registering enterprise apps can lead to data leaks.\n  \nFor that reason, I'd wish that development is out-sourced to a non-production tenant. Or better: Each project gets their own tenant. We have a couple of dozen parallel projects and this could prevent teams getting in each others way - even if that would be only by accident.\n There are currently two ways I can imagine how this works:\n  \nFor every new project, a standalone tenant must be registered. If licenses are needed, they must buy-in. Ideally, this is managed completely separate from IT e.g., by the project manager or a designated tenant-owner. They manage the tenant registration, credit-card info and payments, licensing. We have a devops-department, maybe also they could take over dev-tenant management company-wide.\n For every new project, a M365 developer subscription sandbox is registered. The upside to this is that it is batteries-included with licensing and sample data in most used areas like EXO and SP. The downside is that this tenant is linked to a person in the company, who may leave the company at any point in time. (Now that I think of it, we could use service accounts to have this not linked to real people.)\n  \nI imagine that this tenant should not be managed by IT at all. The project members are responsible for security, compliance and data privacy.\n How are you guys managing this kind of stuff? Are there other solutions I have not thought of yet?\n    submitted by    /u/Caleb__  \n [link]   [comments]",

Today a server rebooted and when it came up again the SQL server was down due to expired evaluation as I found out, when reviewing the logs.\n Turns out the reason for not having a license was that it was too expensive for us, but as long as the DB was >10GB it shouldn't be a problem I was told, but tuns out that only applies if you use the express version. We only need this particular server for 1.5 months more before it will be taken down anyway.\n Is it possible to migrate the db from the standard edition to the express?

This one, however, when I apply the cert users can't login and event log shows 0xC000035B. Replace the new cert with the original one (not due to expire for a few more days), and all good again.\n I figured it might be the cert (somehow), so I tried adding our wildcard cert to the RD Gateway instead. Sure enough, same error. Put the original rds.domain .com cert back in, it works.\n I found various articles suggesting setting EnforceChannelBinding to 0 (via regedit) on the RDG server, which out of curiosity I've done - no difference. I also set LMCompatibilityLevel on my PC to 3, no good. No other posts I've found so far that have to do with that error code have much else info i'm afraid.\n Has anyone else ever seen a new SSL cert cause users to fail logging in? Or does anyone have any ideas where to start looking? Nothing has changed server-side other than the cert, and besides - you'd think if it had, the old cert would have broken... Thanks in advance!\n ​\n EDIT: The only thing different from the last time is that there's a new firewall in that does HTTPS inspection (or something along those lines, it's managed by a 3rd-party). I'm reaching out to them, in case it's the difference in SSL certs causing this, but does that sound likely to anyone else?

I have the staff OU set to be able to verify and approve restricted content and in chrome device policies I have restricted mode disabled for the staff OU as well.\n It works fine in Edge and when I pull the policies JSON it seems to be flagged as a machine policy override, but I can't seem to find a toggle for it, assuming it's some Chrome browser specific setting but I'm not finding anything under Chrome device policies.\n  \"ForceYouTubeRestrict\": { \"conflicts\": [ { \"level\": \"mandatory\", \"scope\": \"user\", \"source\": \"cloud\", \"value\": 0 } ], \"level\": \"mandatory\", \"scope\": \"machine\", \"source\": \"cloud\", \"value\": 2, \"warning\": \"This policy is working as intended but a conflicting value is set elsewhere and is overridden by this policy.\" }, \n Any ideas?\n Edit: From what I can see it's doing at the level of the Chrome application as an HTTP header restriction to the individual machine/browser, going into a guest mode in the browser continues to apply the policy, and I can see the policy is being applied at the machine level in the admin console, but not where the policy is coming from...\n Edit: Changed machine policy at root level to allow, and at student level to disable, which resolved the issue. For some reason it was prioritizing/inheriting the root level machine policy instead of overriding it.\n    submitted by    /u/liefbread  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Before I describe the problem everyone will probably be happy to know that I've already told them to change the hostname of Device B and to never talk to be about this again. But I have a bug up my butt because I should be able to detect where this is coming from, but so far I can't.\n My company writes custom applications that create custom problems. Today's problem is that something is creating dynamic DNS entries on our DNS server on behalf of another device, and the DNS entry it is creating has an IP that conflicts with another device on the network.\n Device A is a Windows 10 PC with IP 192.168.1.100 and hostname Device-A. Device B is some embedded device with IP 192.168.1.200 and hostname Device-A. That's right, duplicate hostname. So the DNS entry for Device A gets over-written with the 192.168.1.200 address and then they can't reach Device A on the network.\n The problem is that it isn't Device B that is creating the entries on the DNS server. We turned Device B off for 24 hours and something still was creating the DNS entry, but I can't find what is doing that. I've run Wireshark captures, Microsoft Network Monitor captures, ProcMon captures, and checked the DNS-Server Audit log in Event Viewer. I can see plenty of entries of Active Directory dynamic updates, arp/LLMNR/NBNS/MDNS queries and responses, SMB advertisements, but none of them are for Device B that I'm looking for. \n Clearly the problem is that I don't have a deep enough understanding of the mechanisms behind this behavior. So I'm hoping someone can throw some terms my way that I can Google and read up on. Or some articles that describe what's going on. I've been doing some Google searches but I'm only finding generic articles/tutorials that don't give any insight into what I'm looking for.\n Thanks in advance for any info you can send my way!\n Edit: Both devices have static IPs configured, no DHCP is involved.\n    submitted by    /u/LearningSysAdmin987  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it sufficient for SMB?\n Ages ago I read up on Azure security defaults (link on bottom), and it appeared to only register users for authentication methods, but it did not enforce MFA use for users, instead only admins. \n Shortly after the announcement - it appeared that they added a \"smart tracking\" (per se) that would have users use MGA when it is necessary. \n With that in mind, does anyone know the exact rules to when users will need to reauthenticate?\n Is this sufficient for SMBs (less than 30 users), or should I use per-user MFA/force upgrades to licensing for Conditional Access?\n I understand that there are many factors, but I would like to understand more in depth. Through testing, I have confirmed that new IPs trigger MFA, but I want to be sure that after some time it get's triggered again.\n ​\n Link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults#require-users-to-do-multifactor-authentication-when-necessary\n    submitted by    /u/Vel-Crow  \n [link]   [comments]",

The most rewarding jobs I have undertaken in the past are going into an AWS environment and saving money on cloud spend and optimising the best performance for less money! \n It's a great value add for any organisation. \n Alot of the organisations spend more on fancy tools to try and save money on Monthly cloud spend which I think is pointless as it often outweighs the cost of the money they try and save. Also I have seen tools that don't even check the basics. The data is already there for you in AWS and it's simply a case of extrapolating it using a bit of engineering time which you pay for anyway and the result is that you can often save more money! \n Certainly I have seen it a lot here in Reddit, Cost is becoming ever more prevalent in many AWS environments. \n Two things to mention, There are copies I will give away for free to those engineers who will agree to read it and implement the savings ideas in their environments and give me feedback and comments, So it would be good to see how much you saved over a month. It would be interesting to gauge feedback. \n I have to spend a bit of time mentoring Juniors in the past so I know especially at the moment how the job market is. So I will give away free copies to Junior engineers looking for ideas how to break into the market and some handy tips to increase your chances of standing out when going to for an interview. \n If you feel this is you, Feel free to DM me. \n Anyway without giving too much away, I have produced a guide for it here. \n Amazon Kindle Link\n    submitted by    /u/DevOpsMuffin39  \n [link]   [comments]",

I dont know what I did but I managed to change my only account on the laptop to local guest user from administrator. Now, there are things that I cannot access becuase it says it needs the approval of admin.\n Usually there will be a prompt like, \"Do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device\" and it has an option of \"Yes\" or \"No\", but since there is no admin now, it only has \"No\".\n I'm stupid I know (lol) but i dont know what to do. hahaha.

One of his responsibilities was updating every employee’s computer to the latest operating system, which he did one by one. He was working late one cold night in October, and the building was silent and still. The motion sensor lights kept turning off around Fred, so he had to keep waving to turn them on. Eventually he gave up and let all of the lights go dark, illuminated only by the blue computer screen as it was making its final updates.\n A light turned on down the hallway, and Fred looked out to see who triggered it. But nothing was there. He turned back to the computer, and then another light flickered on, closer to where Fred was sitting. Again he looked out but didn’t see anyone there.

His words on my replacement \"we don't have one we will just wing it.\" New boss is aware of the requests. He's already looking out for me, wants to make sure old boss does not take advantage of me. These requests were NOT on the offer letter I signed regarding the promotion.\n I respect my old boss, I respect my old small team, I don't want to leave them high and dry... but I'm also excited to move into this specialized role, and I need to spend some time getting up to speed to perform... and honestly, I'm just done with the generalist life, I want to move on, close that chapter.\n Any advice on how I go about this?\n    submitted by    /u/minimum__fresh  \n [link]   [comments]",

By now, we have a small on premise infrastructure (4 Hyper-V hosts) which I wanna bring towards Azure in the future. While I plan the migration, I also want to enhance our daylie routines, workflows and such. The network is/was a mess when I took over.\n Back to the topic:\n Our users require access to MSSQL, create/restore backups and make changes to different databases (I want them to be able to spin up their own databases according to their needs). For now, they install MSSQL Server XXXX locally and use a per-core license, which is working completely fine. My problem: I´m sure the licensing is not correct, so I see urgent need to change this.\n My assumtions there is no difference between licensing SQL Server (Per-Core) on a server system or a client system. \n So my idea was to spin up SQL servers (Dev, Test, Pdroc) with 100% correct licensing, give users access to it with permissions as needed and ban the locally installed SQL servers completely. Any thoughts on this? How are you guys handleing it if the Express edition is not an option due to the restrictions? \n Thanks for your ideas, have a great weekend!\n    submitted by    /u/SignificantBeat1547  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys,\n I'm pretty new in the sysadmin world, currently undergoing my training. My first year or something is in the endpoint management/helpdesk team.\n Atm I'm taking care of setting up new notebooks for users. Here's a short description of the workflow:\n Supervisor sends hardware request - > I send out a premade mail requesting info about software the user needs - > I install the software and set up their HCL Notes - > hand out to user\n Now the issue is that the mail that I send out also asks for the user's Windows and Notes passwords. Every cybersecurity workshop will tell users that their sysadmin will NEVER ask for their password (which is totally correct, right?)\n Obviously we'd somehow get into their accounts anyway so handing out the passwords doesn't really change anything, it just feels wrong I guess? And it probably actually is. \n We need the passwords for a few minor settings in Notes and that's it. I asked my colleagues about it and they answered it with concerns that if users did these settings by themselves they'd scew it up and we'd get more tickets.\n My point of view is that I think that this could be done by the users with a well made tutorial.\n I've been getting more and more confused/negative answers towards the password mails that I sent out so it's also a personal issue because I don't want to answer a mail like \"Yes you are totally right, however...\". \n How do handle this at work and how could I change this situation for the better?

          "description": "The goal of this process is to give the CPU something to execute in case there is nothing else to do (thus it is called idle ;-). Let’s think about the next situation, we have a process using 30% of CPU, in that case PID 0 (System Idle) will consume the remaining 70%. Also, Idle is the first process that the kernel starts. Moreover, there is a kernel thread of System Idle for each vCPU the OS has identified .\n The reason for having an “Idle Process” is to avoid an edge case in which the scheduler (Windows schedule based on threads) does not have any thread in a “Ready” state to execute next. By the way, there are also other schedulers IO and Memory, which we will talk about in one of the next posts/writeups.\n When the kernel threads are executed they can also perform different power saving tricks regarding the CPU. One of them could be halting different components which are not in use until the next interrupt arrives. The kernel threads can also call functions in the HAL (hardware abstraction layer, more on that in the future) in order to perform tasks such as reducing the CPU clock speed. Which optimization is performed is based on the version of Windows, hardware and the firmware installed.\n    submitted by    /u/boutnaru  \n [link]   [comments]",

How did a 3rd party know I just logged into NS in order to send me a fake auth code and how did they know my number? Does NS have a breach? Cant be my phone vendor, for I logged in from a laptop. If traffic was sniffed on my network or pc, there wouldnt be anyway to see the phone number. NS tier1 support didnt know what I was talking about and escalated the case. Hope to get an email from support soon. \n If anyone reading this could log into their NS account to see if the same thing happens and share your feedback, it would be greatly appreciated.\n Side Thought: Why is NS still using SMS for authentication.

Not keeping up on upcoming changes I see Run As accounts are no longer an option and am trying to adjust my Script to use the managed Identity that is created with the Automation resource. The way it worked before was the Run as Account would get a few permissions once it was created the App Reg would get\n  \nApplication Permissions\n Select User.ReadWrite. All\n GroupMember.ReadWrite. All\n Delegated Permissions\n User.ReadWrite\n  \nIt would also get User Admin RBAC role. All of these permission were needed to change the password of a Synced up account and also was used to Read group membership of a security group that had all users with access in it so if one was disabled it would then force a password change Now with a managed Identity I understand it is suppose to be easier but am not able to get it to Write the changed password . I assume it will also have issues with the group membership changes script also.\n Here is the only snippet of the Script where the Run as account was called\n ## get automation account: $connection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection $azconnection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection Connect-AzureAD -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $connection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $connection.CertificateThumbprint write-output \"Connected Azure AD\" Connect-AzAccount -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $azconnection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $azconnection.CertificateThumbprint write-output \"Connected AZ Accounts\" \n    submitted by    /u/jej0584  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was a time where I did 20% work, and 80% trying to exploit the system to gain some sort of advantage over the other standard student accounts. Now, I wasn’t doing this for any malicious intent, just for personal satisfaction. \n Our school had everything very locked down as most did for a student. The limitations were as I would compare to an exam/ kiosk type account at the time. One IT lesson, I was looking at the pxe boot options and found they were using SCCM. I was hit with a login screen and almost admitted defeat. I thought, what the hell and tried my student details. They worked \n Turns out the sysadmins had just added the \\domainusers group to authenticate. Once launched, I was able to re deploy a Windows environment and more notably to me at the time, create a local admin account. Once I found this out, I was able to sit at my allocated computer and happily install all the programs I wanted and hide my tracks. ICT lessons then turned into 100% fun. \n One day, I got caught out by a teacher remotely viewing my screen and got called to the IT office. Had to explain what I had done and instead of a slap on the wrist, I was praised for finding the exploit! \n 2 years after I left the school, I then got a job as a system admin at the same school and even used that scenario to my advantage during my interview. \n And we all lived happily ever after!\n    submitted by    /u/marco7532  \n [link]   [comments]",

I scoured Reddit and every other forum for far too long before I found the solution.\n I ran into 2 cases of the issue this week and tried every which way to fix --- my users' Win10 VDI terminals would auto-lock after 1 minute. However, if I rebooted them and logged in, the problem didn't happen. Then, if I logged out and back in, the problem started up again. Very annoying and tricky to troubleshoot. To make it more annoying, the problem would eventually fix itself over night and the user could log in again and work normally. I'm relatively new here and my coworker said he'd never been able to fix it, confirming as well that it would eventually fix itself over-night.\n Repairing VMWare Tools didn't help either. A complete, total uninstall of VMWare Tools and a reboot completely fixed the issue.

It was not a case for everyone so I started digging and I found that it happens only for people who use the \"Focus Assist\" feature in Windows 10 (former name \"Quiet hours\"). So it was obvious that people who have set \"Alarms only\" won't see the reboot notifications, but there is also an option called \"Priority only\", where you can select applications that can show notifications - this works well when the user chooses Software Center as a priority app manually, via the GUI.\n I'm wondering if anyone knows a way to centrally add items to the priority applications list (via GPO or script)?\n The ideal solution would be to:\n  \nDisable \"Alarms only\" mode in Focus Assist\n have a possibility to add \"Software Center\" to the priority list applications\n  \n   submitted by    /u/TheM4jor  \n [link]   [comments]",

If not by CPU usage then by CPU wakes.\n Recently my opinion solidified when facing the highest CPU usage I've ever seen on Windows 10 on my laptop. This time I knew the culprit upfront (broken windows search, confirmed by windows reliability history error messages). Windows Search constantly banged the CPU and failed to start, CPU die constantly at 65 deg C. As soon as I fixed Windos Search the CPU die temperature dropped to ~40 deg C! The thing is the entire time neither of the built-in Windows Tools (including the Sysinternals Process Explorer) showed any useful information on the issue. No listed component spiked to more than 3-5% of CPU. Even the memory usage tab in Resource Monitor was better at hinting the culprit than the releavant CPU sections!\n What are your thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/rimbooreddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Company is standing up a new enterprise application that is going to be the backbone of the organization. Needs to be extremely highly available and fully support blue/green deployments. The application has a content storage component that just needs to point to an NFS share. Making that NFS share highly available / fully redundant is an exercise left to the implementer, and I'm waffling a bit on deciding what makes sense.\n Solution needs to be fully replicated, clustered, and highly available (instant failover either during outage or during deployments). We also need to be able to support our DR process which currently is replicating on prem VMware VMs to Azure.\n We were going to go with GlusterFS, but just found out that Redhat has killed that product and we definitely want enterprise support for whatever solution we choose.

          "description": "Hello Admins!\n I have a situation where I have some clients working from home. Due to compliance, I have to prevent them from being able to talk to other devices on the network (such as home PCs, IoT devices, etc...).\n We use ESET Endpoint Antivirus and RocketCyber SIEM/SOC software. Both of those applications have an isolation mode that prevents that PC from talking to anything other than the ESET/RocketCyber console.\n Is there anyway to achieve this type of protection using only software, but still allow WAN/Internet access (so basically it can talk to the gateway and nothing else). The isolation modes in the applications I mention, prevent general WAN/Internet access as well... so they won't work in this situation.\n However, since they are able to lock it down to a specific port/application... I assume there must be some way to do what I am describing. I searched around looking for Windows Firewall rules, but those seem to be limited to very specific protocols/ports. I would like true isolation like Wireless access points do in Guest mode.\n Since this is in multiple home networks, I don't really have the option to create network segmentation (VLANs, etc...).\n Any help is greatly appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/g2tegsown  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I'm well versed in remote desktop, having operated several for coming up to two decades. However, this is something new to me...\n We have a customer who's got 30-40 users within a latency of circa 5-10ms to the remote desktop session host. However, they've just had 4 outsourced users added from India (we're in the UK). Each Indian user is around 150-200ms.\n When we have 40 UK-based users concurrently online, the server CPU can sit roughly at 60%. However, if you swap a couple of UK users for Indians, the server CPU will spike and sometimes sit at 90% with spikes to 100% and the associated freezes you get when out of resource.\n Strangely, this manifests itself in a Windows Explorer process taking between 10-20% CPU for each user. However, if you right-click the Windows Explorer process and choose to restart it, the user sees a brief flash on their session as the explorer is reset, and CPU usage dips back to the circa 0% that it normally uses for other users. It quickly returns to the 10-20% range though.\n I was just wondering whether anyone has noticed the correlation between client latency and server CPU usage?\n    submitted by    /u/pentangleit  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are in investigation with the HP Support to solve this but maybe this helps also other people.\n We had this issue on HP Elitebook 845 G7 and Elitebook 855 G7 but i think Elitebook 835 G7 will have this issue too.\n Since the release of Windows 11 we are Testing this new OS version in our environment. A clean install is working great an all policies are prepared. But every upgrade attempt from Windows 10 to Windows 11 ended in a Bluescreen. (UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP)\n Because we had other project ongoing we have waited until Windows 11 22H2. Maybe the problem was solved in this release but we had the same issue. Both scenarios upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11 22H2 and upgrade Windows 11 21H2 to 22H2.\n After this bad experience we created a case at the HP Support. After some troubleshooting and sending them our logs we have found the issue.\n It's the Synaptics touchpad driver. \n When we remove the driver the upgrade is working fine. Now we wait for a response from HP if they will release a fixed driver.\n I will update this post when i receive some new information.\n Regards sys-adm\n    submitted by    /u/sys-adm  \n [link]   [comments]",

Because there will be <a href> links and images within the body that point towards our primary domain, while the sender address would be from the new domain.\n I don't think that's the case, but since i'm stuck in the overthinking game now, i'm not so sure anymore.

I have only one certificate with private key stored in Kleopatra, and it's set to my default identity, and \"ultimate\" trusted.\n I've googled for hours, read through documentation, found examples, but a few of the option switches that are widely referenced don't seem to work with gpg4win (IE, --passphrase-file or --passphrase_fl, or even just --passphrase).\n Here's my current syntax for a test encryption\n .\\gpg -r \"KEYNAME\" -o testencrypt.gpg --pinentry-mode=loopback --passphrase \"PASSPHRASE\" --default-recipient-self --always-trust -encrypt test.txt\n yeilds :\n gpg: ypt: skipped: No public keygpg: test.txt: encryption failed: No public key\n I'm not sure if I even need the passphrase for encryption, rather than decryption - but if I omit --passphrase, it prompts for one.\n I haven't gotten to decryption syntax, but figure it will be pretty much just the opposite process. I noticed the gpg-preset-passphrase.exe program, and ran it and entered the password there - not sure if that impacts anything.\n Thanks for any insight!\n edit : using gpg4win 4.0.3\n    submitted by    /u/mindphlux0  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hardware team resolves the issues, comments on the ticket saying issue has been resolved, can we proceed to close the ticket, customer comments back about a quey on something that is not related the issue i.e. warranty status of the HD which we have to email the OEM and await their reply. Which will extend the SLA even though the main issue has been resolved. \n Do you get the customer to create a new ticket or keep the ticket open?\n For me i think it is a bad practice to keep the ticket open, from my experience usually we'd get the customer to create a new ticket. \n But then again, back then i was working for companies had some of control i.e. HPE, big IT corps. \n But the new company i just joined, i am still getting used to the practice, and i was wondering if i should address this as this might give the customer too much power to dictate and of course my previous question\n I find such practices bad and is making things very confusing which in turn would reduce productivity.\n ​\n Am i wrong?\n Or should i address this? \n I dont wanan address something that would shoot myself in the foot\n    submitted by    /u/ChmodPlusEx  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I just had this discussion and it reminded me that I wanted to raise this point here.\n My current team lead gifted me with this concept - the turd system. A 'turd' is a task that shouldn't exist, doesn't make sense to exist in its current form, and is a pain in the ass to handle, especially in bulk. Turds tends to naturally accumulate into heaps of shit, until either some poor responsible souls goes shovel them, or they get stomped down the drain.\n My team lead is of the firm beliefs that it's a good thing for turds to accumulate, as this triggers the 'turd system' - someone eventually complains that the turds aren't being passed in a timely fashion, and after a few iterations this provides the impetus to restructure or remove the task so as to eliminate the source of turds.\n This strikes me as something that is typical of organizations in general. Dumb shit creates work no one wants to do it, least of all the people who realize it's pointless. If someone handles it, that process never gets reviewed. However, if it's left to break, then eventually decision-makers will resign themselves to changing the process.\n Does your shop have a turd system too?\n    submitted by    /u/senove2900  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was also advised to use: AlwaysUseMSOAuthForAutoDiscover=1 but I haven't removed this key as of yet.\n We continued to have problems for the months with Activation (not licensed) or 'these set of folders can't be opened'\n The main fix after a lot of research seemed to have been the Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin was missing/corrupted. I've been able to mostly fix this with a logon script that checks + reinstall with the following:\n if (-not (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin)) { Add-AppxPackage -Register \"$env:windir\\SystemApps\\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\\Appxmanifest.xml\" -DisableDevelopmentMode -ForceApplicationShutdown } Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin \n For the most part, this script has fixed the daily problems but occasionally, for different people, randomly when they logon in the morning, they won't be able to open Outlook as it'll say 'these set of folders can't be opened' - AAD BrokerPlugin is installed and the main fix is to open Word, go to File > Accounts > Sign out and then sign straight back in. You can then open Outlook straight away - it's a frustrating little resolution.\n Has this else experienced this too?

I'm wanting to either confirm or deny a perception I've made.\n It seems like Windows can occasionally become erratic in small ways until I install pending updates. This can be anything from weirdness with a mouse being difficult to control to losing internet connection on a single machine seemingly at random. Other devices are fine. What has me pointing to Windows updates specifically is that even though my apps, test pings, etc. all return error responses Windows update can sure as shit download updates and install them no problem.\n These usually go away with the handy dandy restart as well (even if I don't install the updates yet) but crop up soon again before long. I've noticed this for years and ran into it again today (the no internet issue specifically) and finally thought to ask. Between these periods my experience is pretty good until they happen again and quite usually there are pending updates. Rinse and repeat. It's not even an every time thing though quite often I am prompt about installing them once I notice the icon. Occasionally when I'm not though is when I've noticed this behavior.\n What gives? Am I mixing correlation/causation? It's hard to imagine Windows having poison pill code to prod users into installing updates, but honestly it wouldn't surprise me either.\n Edit: Thank god I'm not alone. 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/derplordthethird  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I set out to implement syncing with cloud-hosted Snipe-It, I wanted a solution flexible enough to deal with possible problems in the source data. The result is a set of PowerShell scripts utilizing snazy2000's excellent SnipeitPS module ( https://github.com/snazy2000/SnipeitPS). The main premise is flexibility, working off cache wherever possible, and creating and assigning entities in snipe-it when needed (departments, companies, locations, etc.). The scripts can be found on github at https://github.com/mattcarras/SnipeItSyncPS.\n Quick tidbits about each script:\n - SnipeIt-Sync-PS.ps1: The main API script, which is dot-sourced by the other two scripts. Requires snazy2000's SnipeitPS module.\n - SnipeIt-AD-Sync.ps1: Complete script for syncing user information from AD. Syncs the SID to the EmployeeNum field by default for greater flexibility. Supports all fields supported by SnipeitPS, including syncing info about departments, companies, and managers, as well as setting groups. Also supports flagging or deleting users which no longer exist in AD. Should work with minimal changes. Also technically supports updating passwords, it's recommended to use SSO instead.\n - SnipeIt-Asset-Sync.ps1: Script for syncing asset information from previously exported CSV, direct from SCCM via WMI, direct from AD, or direct WMI queries. You will need to set the fields in each function to match whatever you're importing.\n Hopefully the scripts may prove useful in some way. Feel free to build your own syncing solution using parts or all of the API. And while the scripts are currently being used in an enterprise environment without issue, feel free to submit bug reports on github if you encounter any problems.\n    submitted by    /u/mattcarras  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use O365/Exchange Online so the mailboxes are in cached mode. We are using Citrix UPM for handling the user profiles, and FSLogix Office Containers for handling the cached ost-files.\n ​\n Everything seems to be working fine, except the fact that the search index for Outlook does not seem to work. We are letting Server 2019 handle the search database - not UPM or FSLogix - as per MS recommendation. We can see that the per-user database (.edb file) is created in the user profiles. However, they do not seem to update and the size of the .edb files never increases from the initial size of 8196 KB. \n When we look at the indexing status in Outlook, it shows that Outlook is a location that should be indexed, but it also shows that 0 items have been indexed. And it shows that 0 items are still needed to be indexed. \n On a normal Windows 10 PC with Outlook it shows how many items have been indexed. And I've read somewhere that the size of the per-user database .edb should increase, when indexing large mailboxes. \n So what is your experience - is it normal that Outlook shows 0 items indexed? To me this indicates that something is not right? And should't the size of the .edb in the user profile increase, when indexing large mailboxes (10-15 GB ost-files)?

When booting up everything is ok, no errors, no faults, no lights...\n The drive passes ITDT health test with all passed. Since i only use lto6 at home i also only tested lto6. Speed it does in health test is 151 mb/s, not full 160, but no failure either.\n I then started full write test. That fails after about 1 hour with EC 6 in ITDT and F3 01 SCD 5 Dtive broken on the library. Wont accept tapes or anything unless powercycled. After powercycle all good.\n What i dont understand is, why does the drive pass health test but fails full write. Both failed ok, but one passed one failed doesnt add up for me.\n Use data: 12/2018 built, 1200 day Power on time, 40 power cycles, 40 cleans so far in lifetime, 3000 catridge loads.\n Newest firmware is installed.\n My first guess due to the high load count is worn out head. But can you really wear out a drive in just 3 years? My other hp drives are 8-10y old and work super fine. Or do you have any other ideas, suggestions, tips?\n If its the head: does anyone have a source for the spare? I am not afraid of a bit DIY, and wont pay 1500 eur to a company to fix it for my home use case (used just for me ar home, have 3 working lto6 drives so i am fine).\n Would be great to find some help.\n    submitted by    /u/modtta4455  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Howdy folks,\n Hope this helps some people out who need it. I covered the full SC-900 - Microsoft Security, Compliance & Identity Fundamentals course in one video, the editing for this nearly killed me, well not really, it was just a lot of work to make lol.\n Anyway the video is about almost 5 hours long since it covers the whole dang course obviously. With that said, if someone is looking for something specific in the course, it would take them forever to find it so I added a list in the video description with most of the main topics that are covered with time stamps next to each topic.\n The time stamps will make it quicker and easier for people to find what they are looking for if they don't want to watch the whole thing and are just looking for something specific.\n I will be adding a extra video after the course which will have practice questions in it to help prepare for the exam. Now before anyone goes and asks, no, those practice questions are NOT the questions out of the actual official exam, those kinds of questions are against Microsoft's rules and not allowed.\n The practice questions I make will however cover the same topics and measure you on the same skills so they are legal and allowed by Microsoft.\n As I said in the beginning, I hope this helps some of you out since I know what it's like when your boss/company forces you to write an exam and not being able to find any study resources for it.\n Same can be said for folks who can't afford to pay courses or who just can't find anything online. This should plug that hole.\n Below is a short 4-5 min course intro video I made which explains the course.

Please do the needful to mitigate and provide turnaround time for resolution!\"\n Turns out, the resolver (the OS-component, not a DNS-Server) on some linux systems regularly checks the Root-NS directly for the trust anchors. Not really critical and can be turned off with 2 commands.\n What i found strange is that it has been like that for several years and only a handful of customers was either paranoid, curious or bored enough to actually notice this so far. \n So yeah...maybe look into that in advance if you have spare time before somethings pops up during an audit on the firewall and it becomes a high-prio issue.\n    submitted by    /u/Octa_vian  \n [link]   [comments]",

They don't have significant financial resources, but they're cresting the amount of \"random\" systems that I can support without some management capability. \n Setting up an entire active directory domain is extremely cost-prohibitive for them, so I'm looking for solutions. They already have a new Synology NAS, and it appears that Synology's offering for their Directory Server is pretty alright for what I think I need.\n I'm looking for a way to standardize accounts & permissions across their workstations, as well as a way to push group policies to the machines. It looks on the surface that all of this is supported. \n They currently use a paid Google service for all their email, etc. but I've also thought of Microsoft 365 for them if the juice is worth the squeeze. From what I've been reading, they'd be paying the same price, but I would get all the added benefit of AD features (not all, but the critical ones).\n So, my question is this... \n  \nDoes anyone here have any experience using Synology's DS offering?\n \nWhat are you using for secondary DNS? I know the primary DNS is recommended to be run on the Synology along with the DS. \n Currently DNS is on their pfsense, but I wouldn't mind turning that into the secondary if it would support all the weird things needed for DS to work correctly.\n \n Has anyone use the Microsoft 365 offering? Is that worth checking out? How does it handle Group Policy, etc.\n  \nI'm sure this conversation will evolve, but I'd love to hear folks impressions.\n Full disclosure: For my background, I spent 10 years as a Windows System admin from 2000-2010 and am very comfortable in that environment. I then switched careers into Cyber and now focus on OT, so I've been Linux focused for the last 12 or so.

Typically, they are understaffed in IT as it is, and hardly pay for the necessities let alone an asset management system. I know there are free options out there, but I can't vouch for helpful those might be. Aside from that, we still have to rely on other people to physically return or ship these devices back, at least this is the case in my role. That's the part I hate, depending on someone else to do their job. How the hell do you make sure so and so returns all the equipment they should have in possession at the end of their employment? I mean printers and monitors don't exactly go back into their boxes nice and neatly if they still even have them. I sure as hell can't depend on an end user to pack things up nice and safely.

There’s been discussion about going back to “standard” laptops for these guys as they aren’t exactly roughing it in the backwoods but I want to present a more current option for a rugged device if possible.

          "description": "So let me start off by saying that I recently started a new job, where I'm trying to implement MDT for imaging. I came from a position where I was using SCCM for imaging, so I'm familiar with Task Sequences, but I'm familiar with SCCM TS, which are a bit different from the MDT. (SCCM provides more options in the TS - More steps that aren't available in vanilla MDT)\n That being said, I've got my TS to install the Operating System, but it won't install applications. If I try to install applications without rebooting, it says that it can't install applications from WinPE, so it's going to reboot. Then it reboots and never finishes the TS.\n From doing some Google searching, it seems that it's the WinRE that performs this step. However, I can't get my TS to boot into WinRE to do that step. When I do the reboot step, it reboots into the main Windows OS, and just finishes the windows setup. The steps after that reboot never run. What am I doing wrong? How can I get it to reboot and still finish the task sequence?\n    submitted by    /u/havens1515  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m a catch-all IT manager and the latest thing to fall on my lap is joining an international office to our UK-based domain. We have a handful of staff abroad and we want to get their computers fully corporate/policy/etc.\n I don’t know where to begin as networking is my least strongest subject within my many, many hats.\n Right now those in the international office will VPN in to access network resources. But this is just like “working from home”.\n What I want is a second AD DS server over there which will act as a backup DC and allow “local” authentication, etc. Corporate laptops will therefore always be domain joined.\n Where do I begin?\n My research says something like purchasing: a router/firewall, a switch, a windows server, then the various cabling/infrastructure and probably an Aruba Instant-on AP for wireless.\n Do I configure the windows server to VPN on over to our domain? \n I’m getting a flight over and buying a Netgate 4100 running Pfsense. Do I configure the VPN there?\n I appreciate this is a big question and a big can of worms, and I can see why people might suggest employing a 3rd party network specialist to sort it over there, but I reckon getting over the domain join hurdle and setting up the firewall are the 2 only obstacles I have.\n Any thoughts greatly appreciated – thanks from an overworked, overhatted, accidental sysadmin.\n    submitted by    /u/saladnicoise  \n [link]   [comments]",

At my current $job we have multiple VLANs for various systems, the basic network is CLIENT (untagged) --> Cisco Phone (Tagged) --> Meraki/Netgear Switch --> Cisco Nexus --> Router (VyOS) --> HyperFlex + Vmware --> Windows Server 2019 with DHCP (in fail over) + MDT Server.\n The VyOS router has DHCP relay listeners on all the client networks to route them to the Windows servers for DHCP (or MDT).\n Now the issue is VLAN 1 (as the default) is only used for network management, everything else is on their own VLANs.\n 100 - VoIP / 200-202 - Client / 300 - Servers\n So the issue is, some PCs (Dell desktops) or laptops (Dell Laptop + Dock OR Lenovo Laptop + Dock) picks up a DHCP offer from the wrong network. Some times it could be on the old client VLAN or currently it's attempting to bind to VLAN 1's range.\n Most of the PCs, if we get Windows (10 or 11) to do a network reset (or manually do netsh winsock reset & netsh ip int reset), the system comes good.\n Notes\n  \nStatically setting the IP address, allows the computer to work on the correct VLAN\n The computer gets the IP but fails to release OR communicate with anything (IE if it's on the wrong VLAN)\n All the DHCP is running from 2 servers in a failover configuration under M$ on Windows\n The computers are either freshly built or been running for about 3-9 months\n Everything is updated to the latest versions (as per M$ for Windows, Dell/Lenovo for drivers, Cisco/Netgear for switches, VyOS for router)\n Each port is configured for the native VLAN to be the correct client VLAN + the VoIP VLAN being tagged for the phones.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/nephi_aust  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are completely legally separate from our main org, so they can't be on our main infrastructure. \n They're only 10 employees, but need an RDS server as they have an old-school financial system and a couple apps which need to run on a server (and need SQL). Currently they have an older RDS server managed by an outgoing MSP. That server is attached to the MSP's domain, so the users use separate credentials for logging in to RDS.\n We're replacing/upgrading the RDS server, which on the surface is easy enough. The challenge is - this company has no domain environment otherwise, so on top of an RDS server, we'd have to spin up a DC. They do have 365 / Azure AD though.\n Just wondering - is there a more graceful way of handling RDS without the domain? Could people login using Azure auth.

          "description": "Or in other words: Do I need a backup MX?\n The situation is this: I want to receive newsletters from news sites. Some senders are high traffic senders that send out a lot of emails to each subscriber, sometimes even 1 per minute, or 1 per 10 minutes on average.\n I have trouble with receiving this amount with various email service providers, because I run into receiving rate limits. So, I’m considering hosting my own mail server for this purpose.\n But self-hosting on a VPS can have outages…\n I don’t mind if some emails get lost if the senders don’t retry, but I don’t want them to stop sending me all together if my server goes down temporarily.\n Let’s say my server goes down for 1 or 2 days for whatever reason. (Let’s not discuss how likely it is. There may be an outage, or I may screw something up.) Also, let’s assume my server is either up or down, but when it’s up, it’s accepting mails normally. So, I’m not rejecting mails.\n So, the question is this: If there is a busy sender that sends out a huge number of emails, and they see my server went offline or port 25 is not responding for a day or two, then what happens? What’s the most common behaviour? Will they resume sending me when my server comes online again? Or will they consider me gone forever?\n Phrasing it in another way: How long would a receiving mail server need to be down in order for a busy sender to stop sending to it all together?\n Or does it depend on the sender and the situation, and there is no standard behaviour?\n The special situation here is that these are busy senders. I understand that normally a sender should and will retry. But when a sender sends out hundreds of emails a day or more to each of its subscribers, they may handle this differently.\n Again, I don’t mind lost mails, I just don’t want to re-subscribe to the newsletters after every outage I may have.\n And I don’t really want to have a backup MX unless I really need to.\n Some expert advice would be appreciated… Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/BurnedShipMan  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specs are:\n CX11\n vCPU 1 Intel\n RAM 2 GB\n Disk space 20 GB\n Traffic 20 TB\n The backend Rust app (using Actix) is a non-issue - it's under 20MB and no RAM spikes at all even under benchmarking via wrk etc.\n The proxy server will by Nginx which is also a non-issue when it comes to RAM consumption.\n I want to use Ubuntu 22.04 but if it eat too much RAM perhaps I could try Alpine - I want to run things like wkhtmltopdf (this will spike the RAM for a few seconds unfortunatelly) etc. but perhaps that is a non-issue.\n I don't want to use Docker - the 2 GB RAM would be an issue and with one file deployment of the Rust binary app it's not worth it.\n The most important question I have is about the SQL db I will use.\n So, it has to be relational database and I have only a couple of options: MySQL, PostgreSQL and perhaps some forks like MariaDB or something else.\n Can you recommend a DB that is the most RAM efficient under heavy load? I am mostly interested in reads, not so much writes into the DB. As I said it is an API backend that mostly serves JSON via relatively simple selects and an occassional joint here and there - nothing too crazy though.\n I will probably off-load the homepage for not-logged in users and some mostly accessed parts of the app to Redis, but still, I want something that would work relatively well when it comes to the available 2 GB RAM even without Redis - at least from the beginning ;)\n It will be mostly mobile apps accessing the API, so frontend rendering etc. is not the problem here.\n Thanks for your recommendation and advice - especially if you have used Hetzner CX11 servers or some other servers like this with databases.\n    submitted by    /u/DragonfruitTasty7508  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, \n Recently I have got into I.T, in our warehouse prob( 300-400 people overall) as someone with no IT background. We are working as system administrators even though we do not access to a lot of stuff, we have a HQ group called Central , they have to give permissions for certain stuff( I assue they are level 2 or level 3 ). So recently for preaparation for Black Friday our packing department have been prepared and did some mock test with like 50 packers at the same time. \n The problem is that as soon as people (30-50 start to work the invoice from our printer gets really slow to print sometimes (1- 2 minutes, normally it takes like 5-10 second).\n We use DLX as a WMS. We have given a list to Central with all the cabinets and sockets that these printers are using so they can monitor it. They said they have not seen any slowness from that part. ok.\n In DLX we have a thing called \"Run Task\". It basically shows when the sytem processed the order. So if you check the time from the moment you press the print button after you packed an order until the run task actually run you can see the time it took to process it. its quick like couple seconds. ok. \n And then we have a print server where we have all the printers added ( something like a print host). This is the last idea we have currently to check how long does it take from the DLX to send the information to this print server. Everything we have checked or sent to Central came back as no issues or signs for slowness.\n Also its confusing because during people's breaktime there were like 25 packers only, printing went back to like 5 second. And then after an hour with like 30 or 35 ish people it just slowed down to 1 minute again. ( it is kind of inconsistent.)\n ​\n Does anybody have any other idea what would worth to be checked?\n    submitted by    /u/Nervous_Lab_4287  \n [link]   [comments]",

After I discovered this attack path, I stumbled across a presentation from Defcon 19 (which was 11 years ago) talking about these sort of attacks.\n The remediation is simple though, just change your MFPs' default passwords.\n    submitted by    /u/faceerase  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have just a bit of experience with scripting, but mainly simple commands (I don't dare calling them scripts) like get-something|foreach{ do some stuff}. And I composed this first big script that I intend to use in automated AzAD user provisioning. \n The script will take the employee data (Firstname, lastname, workmail, etc) from the HR System (BambooHR) with an API call and it then creates users/modify them in AzAD using a foreach loop, some identifiers from BambooHR attributes+AzAD attributes and IFs to identify the operations needed to be performed. I also wanted to have logging as good as possible, there are still some things to be improved on this part too. It's not yet completed, this is the first working and tested version, (I did run it in production, yes :) but before I did, I exported every single user attribute/licenses info to a csv and prepared a script to restore everything back to the state using this csv) I will also adjust the documentation based on the final result. I'm also thinking of a better...logical way to go for 3 big IF-s. But I was thinking, what else can I use instead of those many many If-s? I thought of array comparison, but there would still be IF-s....some custom function? Please let me know some suggestions, and how good I'm doing.\n Overall, the script performance looks \"ok\" from my perspective (the company has less than 150 employees right now) and, when it had to modify about 10 users and create 2 accounts, it took 2 minutes to run. And when it just checked stuff, with applying only 2 modifications, it took 34 seconds.\n Here you can find it\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/tony_pitonii  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think we found if N-Able is on the device it takes over all elements of the patching aspect and ignores Intune.\n In any case we are meandering options but would be good to know what you do.\n Another question - if you set the target release on a device does that prompt it to update immediately or does that just say to the device you can only go up to this release as and when its made available?\n ​\n Many thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Wu-Disciple  \n [link]   [comments]",

I loved using PDQ as a sysadmin, but I think its users need to know this.\n Edit: typo\n Also, here’s the link from PDQ on how to setup PDQ with LAPS.\n    submitted by    /u/faceerase  \n [link]   [comments]",

Add into that mix all the office politics and nepotism, and it's ubiquitous.\n If you suffer an injury, are recovering from surgery, a personal situation occurs (death of a loved one, divorce, new baby, etc.), anything along those lines, obviously that may demand more time away from work and/or less ability to perform the work when doing it.

But, the comments made me conclude that restricting user access is not as significant as other security measures. \n But today, I came across an update from MS on the recent two zero-day vulnerability issues and the required mitigation steps.

I just had an idea yesterday, hoping to confirm it here.\n My home only has copper cables (no fiber possible) which prevents me to subscribe to any internetplan above 100Mbit/s.\n I've been thinking of buying a 5G-Router which in my country/location achieves roughly 2Gbit/s down (I know that latency is different over 5G than Fiber but this is something I'm willing to accept). \n The issue is, that 99% of routers I've seen don't have a SFP port but only 1Gbit LAN-Ports and the ones that do have an SFP-Port cost more than 1600€.\n Now, my idea is to buy a 5G-Router like this one from MikroTik https://mikrotik.com/product/chateau_5g . I have a SuperMicro CSE-118 lying around with an Intel 340-T4 (Quad Port RJ45) and an Intel X520-DA2 (SFP+) in it which I would use as an pfSense Server.\n Would it be possible to connect 4 Ports of the 5G Router to the Server, link aggregate them, connect the SFP-Port to a switch, and distribute the whole possible bandwith of 2Gbit to other devices?\n This is just a rough idea and I haven't thought about possible hickups (or none came to my mind thinking about this)\n Thank you all in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Suggestion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thus, their key target would be standard users, as getting their credentials using password spray or purchasing via cybercriminal economy becomes effortless.\n Few days back, I wrote a blog with the steps to restrict users' access to the Azure AD portal.

The high score I recorded so far is 135 days of uptime. I’ve had users complain they’re falling behind because of their computers performance speed. Users who don’t restart because restarting takes forever to boot. Users who insist they tried restarting multiple times before reaching out to the help desk.

          "description": "As someone said sub going downhill thought I'd post this? Anyone use the sysinternal? \n I use them at work and they've always come in useful. While working I'll sometimes put Mark Russinovich Case of the Uxexplained talks on and listen to them in background. Nearly all the time I'll suddenly hear a bit I've never noticed before.\n Remember in the old company I was in we had a weird issue on laptops only. Still on XP (they were behind. Was in about 2012) The user would go to explorer and the laptops would freeze for about 5 mins. Then eventually the network drives would appear. I'd grab process monitor traces where I could but instead of giving me time to look our manager would say \"Just rebuild them. Don't waste time\". Rebuilding them was a cocking waste of time.\n Eventually her own laptop got hit with the issue just as she was going on leave. So convinced her to let me look at hers. Ran process monitor as it happened but couldn't see anything obvious so ran process explorer. Just like in Task Manager you could see explorer at 50% but we all know task manager is useless. Looked into the explorer deeper with procexp and could see one .dll it was using running at 50%\n Ooo, could it be that? The .dll was being used by PGP the software we used to encrypt the laptops. Googled what the .dll did. All it did was scan the network looking for encrypted files so it could change their icon. We never used encrypted files so wasn't needed & apparently there were rare issues with it. So I unregistered it.\n Problem solved. Now instead of having to rebuild the laptops that took quite a while, I could fix them in under 5mins.\n I still take traces of issues wherever I can to look at them later. Started to build up a collection now and keep notes with the traces where I used the tools to fix issues.\n    submitted by    /u/steviefaux  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have choosen one, the SuperMicro X12SCA-F (pictured here) but I have some questions about adding a 10 GB network card on it.\n I have already an ASUS NVMe PCIe x16 Card, which allows me to add up to 4 NVMe Drives (4 x 4 x 4 x 4 lanes) destined to be mounted on the first PCIe slot (X16).\n Consequently, the 2nd PCIe x16 slot will be disconnected. Which leaves me one PCIe x4 Slot.\n I have found this Intel x550 T1 PCIe 3 x4 that seems to be ok to pair with, but I have 2 questions before I click to buy it :\n 1 – How will a NIC plugged on this slot affect the latency of my internet connection since it is linked to the MB chipset (PCH) and not directly to the CPU ?\n 2 – Is this slot shared with the M.2 slot or anything else ? In other words, do I have to expect some troubles or bottleneck from using this slot for my purpose ?\n Thanks a lot for your reply! \n    submitted by    /u/10yrs_to_the_day  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I'm asking here if there is a \"full solution\" already available for Docker (for what I searched, it's always \"bits\" : either there is VPN + Guacamole, either Guacamole + LetsEncrypt, etc. but not the whole thing), if I should install it on the machine without Docker, or if I should make my own Dockerfile.\n This is considering I want to set up some OTP (at least) to guard the thing off.\n What do you guys think?

A test cert I issued to a website got outright rejected by Google Chrome (with no option to move forward) despite having the whole cert chain imported to my system. \n I ran a cert lint tool on the certs using online (https://crt.sh/lintcert) tool, and it spew out so many errors, I was questioning my ability as a sysadmin. \n I won't go into details of what the errors are since they are pointless at this stage. But stuff like mandatory Subject alternative names, and the abolishment of CNs, requirement for policy extensions, are some of the few things that have changed over the past few years, and none of the guides I used bothered to address any of this either.\n Hence, my question is, do any of you guys have a good reference guide that I can follow to create an internal CA the way the internet overlords intended in the current day and age, since apparently all the guides I have followed on the internet are all very much outdated. \n And yes, I am aware I can bypass these warnings by manual adding to chrome, and using secret codes or whatever, but remember that this is going to be used in a real production environment so such work arounds are not a permanent solution. \n P.S.

However, I hope you could help with my issue:\n I have to update the company's DC so I did set up a a new DC with Win2022 as secondary DC, joined to the AD forest, and make sure the replication of AD Sites and Services, DNS, and GPOs were fine. The old one is a Win2012, I kept both running for a while, until I had some free time to decommission the old one.\n Finally, today I did transfer all the FSMO roles to the secondary DC make it as primary, the old DC is hosting the DNS server as well, so I added the new DC to each Forward Lookup Zone FQDN and changed the DNS in the network settings pointing our AWS Route53 (which I don't manage). At first, until the old DC was online and after I transferred the FSMO roles, all the clients and workspaces were able to resolve the new DC as DNS server, the group policies update correctly, everything looks fine. \n Unfortunately, after I shut down the old DC, the new DC could not resolve out domain and lost the all the metadata it replicated before. Starting back the old DC resolved the issue, and everything went back to normal.\n Now I don't know what exactly where the issue is, I suspect this is something to do with the DNS but I really don't know what I missed.\n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/FedeDost  \n [link]   [comments]",

But it requires maintaining a completely redundant copy of all of the data on a Synology NAS just to be able to serve the data over Synology Drive. We use Syncthing to keep our Windows<>Synology in lock step and it's working but it's a fragile arrangement and requires redundant storage. \n Sharepoint Server is the obvious choice for a cloud file server, however for just 8 users Sharepoint Server is $7,200/license + $150/user CAL = $16,000 it's from a cost perspective more expensive than buying a 250TB TrueNAS server and just doing the Syncthing dance.\n Resilio technologically looks great, but we only have 8 users and in order to get a Windows Server license you need at least 20 users which means we would be paying $200/mo. \n OwnCloud and NextCloud offer exactly what we need, but back in 2017 they abandoned Windows. We could run them in a hypervisor, but then we'll need to duplicate the data into the VM and double our storage. \n Qsync in QuTScloud would let us host a QNAP OS image in Hyper-V for a reasonable price per year but would also require us to duplicate our storage in the VM which means double the costs for hard drives. \n Is there someone I'm missing who works with Windows Server and doesn't have crazy enterprise rates assuming that 80TB will only ever be needed by multinational corporations?\n    submitted by    /u/im_thatoneguy  \n [link]   [comments]",

He sends them over and I pop them in the server. Get into the configuration utility and it isn’t recognizing the drives. It is showing the drives as failed. \n I think that’s crazy that he sent me two failed drives but hey anything can happen. He sends me two more drives and boom those both say failed. At this point I get a supervisor involved after I try everything with the drives I can think of. \n He takes one look at it and says, “Those are SAS drives and this server uses SATA. You got the wrong drives”\n Facepalm…….\n A quick google search reveals that you can use SATA with a SAS connector but not the other way around.

Instead, they direct you to ask a Certified Partner. \n I wish they just said \"The API needs to write/read the mailboxes using EWS with OAuth authentication\" or really any indication of the required function/permissions.\n ​\n So, if you're trying to set this up: \n  \nInstall at least TM 16.6\n Create an Enterprise application in Azure, create a corresponding client secret\n Verify that OAuth2 is enabled for the tenant\n You need permissions for the API to Exchange Web Services using full_access_as_app\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/how-to-authenticate-an-ews-application-by-using-oauth#configure-for-app-only-authentication\n Reconfigure the Exchange sync on the server with the API values and verify the connection\n \n Hope this saves someone else some time.

Eventually located, blocked, changed passwords, altered MFA, coverted this mailbox to a licensed etc. The whole company is about to have all passwords changed and MFA sessions revoked.\n We already do:\n  \nYearly training std\n Atleast 2, if not 3 fake phishing tests a year that lead to extra training\n We have Avanan in place since Sept.

          "description": "So at work we've been batting around the whole IPv6 chestnut, for the past year or so. We've gotten to the point that some of our providers don't provide IPv4 anymore unless you cough up a bundle of money, so we want to go IPv6 only. \n And that's where the fun starts. So many external services we rely on don't support IPv6. Github for one doesn't. Docker's registry doesn't. Most of the CPAN mirrors (yeah, we use Perl in a few places) don't. A lot of Ubuntu's repository mirrors don't. It's actually easier to list the things that *do* support it than the things that don't, it's a sad and very small list. \n So tell me, how to transit to a full IPv6 stack when 90% of external services flat out don't support it, and (in Github's case at any rate) don't seem too interested in getting it to work?\n    submitted by    /u/blockstackers  \n [link]   [comments]",

Keep in mind I'm a junior sysadmin at best so I'll try to include all the needed details while keeping them sanitized. \n Quick run down: I have a ipsec site to site vpn between two networks with 1Gb duplex connections through two pfsense 7000 series firewall appliances. Connection is stable however iperf only shows a bandwidth of 68 Mbps with transfer capping out at 8.50 MBytes from two hyper-v vm on either side of the tunnel. File transfers from local to remote site are also very slow at 20Mbps. While these speeds may work for my use case temporarily I can't help but feel I am missing something to speed this connection up.\n Steps I have taken to attempt to speed this up:\n Set MSS clamping to 1396 after calculating my OMSS. Sniffed before and after the changes and it fixed a fragmentation issue but speeds are unchanged. Using UDP over IPv4 for tunnel.\n Ensure there was no duplex mismatch on any NIC and no traffic shaping is in place.\n CPU's are mostly idle and a combined usage of less then 15%\n Asynchronous Cryptography is on, compression is off, no rules conflict with traffic.\n Any thoughts? I am at a loss and about to attempt another VPN option in the mean time to see if I can get better speeds elsewhere.\n    submitted by    /u/boringlichlight  \n [link]   [comments]",

It isn't easy for them to just use another car.\n They had been on vacation for 2 weeks, they weren't pingable, and I couldn't even see their car on Netcloud or their MDT on my RMM.\n Got there and the Cradlepoint was handling out its default subnet, couldn't ping through it, and I couldn't get into the unit as it appeared to be factory reset. Had to spend an unreasonable amount of time dismounting it to find the default on the rear of it.\n Logged in and I was greeted with a subscription expiration.\n Cradlepoint will reset your device to factory defaults, and NOT PASS ANY TRAFFIC OF ANY SORT without a subscription.\n I heard this had happened a few firmware versions ago.\n But, WE WERE CURRENT and had been for years! It was a licensing issue on their side that just randomly took a license away from it, no notice of any sort, no indication on the main screen.\n Beyond unacceptable and will be replacing all of them next year. Sierra's Netcloud is a little lacking for templating, but I will absolutely not have a mission critical device stop working entirely, requiring an on-site visit to find out a fucking subscription issue for a router.

I didn't know anything and learned everything on the go starting with level 1 servicedesk at a ~25-man MSP. Over the past years I managed to step up and implement/solve more complex stuff. I went from rookie to network engineer configuring routers, firewalls and switches in complex setups. On the side I also was \"un-official\" teamlead of support by now. Teaching the new guys the ropes - I was the go to guy for most people to come to who were at our office. It became taxing on me: The workload was high and this made the place unsociable. The mandatory on-call shifts (one full week every 6 weeks on average) were very busy too, often clocking 4-8 additional hours outside of regular times. On top of that the pay was bad too, fairly below market average for a lot of employees on the team (people talked about it which management did not like of course, berating those who discussed it).\n Upcoming Monday I am starting a new job, I am leaving the MSP world and starting as a sysadmin at a company with about 85 employees. Working 36 hours (49) for about the same pay I got when working 40 hours (58). There is one other sysadmin who has been there for about 8 years now and the focus of the company is software development for a webservice they are hosting.\n The reason I am posting this is to gather input of other people who have made the same switch, how did life change for you?

I also discovered if I re-queued a message it would go back to deferred but if I skipped the scan engine and just flat out deliver it, the mail would show up… Must be something with email scanning so I reboot the appliance. That doesn’t fix it so I call Barracuda and open a case. The tech said he’s been doing it these calls all night. They pushed out a bad update and I locked up a scanning engine service. A reboot doesn’t clear it. I had to start up the troubleshooting remote connection so the tech could push out an update and restart the service. I couldn’t have done it myself as they lock that ability behind support.\n TLDR: If you’re having trouble with external emails getting stuck in the queue on your Barracuda after Wednesday night, then call support. They pushed a bad update.\n    submitted by    /u/In_Gen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, after 9 years of being a help desk dipshit I have just started at a company where I am now the sole IT guy and they haven't had one before. The guy who was doing anything with tech is my manager, the director of operations. There's a couple of people who have slapped together some scripts, and my manager's experience is somewhere around \"has built a gaming PC\". They use an MSP for managing anything that's above my manager's capacity and my job is to bring that in house.\n Honestly I'm really liking it. It's a small company of around 60 users and I've got a whole list of projects to accomplish and I've added a couple of my own ideas to the list, I think I can really tighten things up and get them running a bit more smoothly, get some disaster recovery procedures in place, etc. I'm feeling strangely confident in my ability to do what is being asked of me. That's not what I'm here for today.\n I'm only a few weeks in and this company hasn't really had an actual IT guy before, they've just had Chad the Ops Guy calling vendors. So, in order to help ease myself into a company that has a few decades of experience running but zero experience having an actual IT guy I want to do some user training of sorts. I want to do a sort of informal getting to know you and you getting to know me and what I can do with the title and theme being the title of this post.\n I have a few ideas for what sort of stuff goes in there, but I'd love to have your input. Folks who have started at small companies that haven't had IT people before them, what are the weird growing pains as companies get used to your presence? What won't the company expect about what my position brings to the table? I'm looking to bring some funny too, I figure anytime you're asking the users to change If you can make them laugh a little while you do it then it goes over better.\n    submitted by    /u/FartButt_ButtFart  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't like being biased, if there is a reason someone may think MBAM isn't that great I'd definitely like to know why for my own preferences and knowledge.\n    submitted by    /u/ib4error  \n [link]   [comments]",

Measuring on my macbook air on the same desk I see -98db noise and -44db RSSI.\n I also connect the work computer to my IoT vlan which has no access to my LAN, I redirect DNS to my pfsense box and redirect NTP to my pfsense box on all of my vlans (LAN, IoT, Guest) with no issue.\n We used to use BIG-IP and had zero issues with this software.\n EDIT: My work computer is some Dell with an i7, 16gb ram and Windows 10 Enterprise.\n    submitted by    /u/mrpink57  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello All,\n We're curious how other IT professionals are managing ex-employees' mailboxes when they leave the company. The organization is experiencing rapid growth and we've found our current process isn't scalable. We use Microsoft 365, but our users have the desktop applications such as Outlook through VL. Currently, when an employee leaves the company either through termination or resignation, we add ourselves to the ex-employee's 365 account and perform a manual export of their mailbox to a PST. This PST gets saved and stored on our file server forever. Seems fairly simple when it's listed like that, but it's quite a tedious process from start to finish. You need to give yourself access to that person's mailbox, let it pull in their mail on Outlook which usually takes at least an hour if not more before it becomes accessible, (and you'd be surprised at how big we let employees' mailboxes get to), and then perform the export which again, depending on the mailbox size could just freeze your Outlook up for some time. Now ironically enough we recently found that it looks like you could do all of that in the Compliance center in 365, but we still want to look at our overall process and reassess. Do we really need to keep these employees' mailboxes forever? Does 30 days suffice and then we blow it away (with exceptions of course)? Converting to shared mailboxes seems to be a popular method - what does that look like long-term? Do you use a third-party cloud solution to archive mailboxes? \n In short, we're just looking to explore how other businesses retain 365 mailboxes to determine our options. \n Thank you in advance. \n    submitted by    /u/Maverick10121  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a domain env and we use point and print on windows 2019 server. On user's machine, In Settings > printers, when printer is installed from print server, I check printer preferences and all settings appear just like on server. But when they try to print from chrome or edge, when printing dialog pops up, I would select the printer and chose preferences, but none of the settings are there. Like stock/paper selection for example. It's like something is preventing browsers to read printer preferences. I will try again signing in as me (different domain account) and checking if issue is present but I'm pretty sure I had the user sign in on another computer and had the same issue.

          "description": "I joined my current company in February this year, the CIO who brought me had also just started few months earlier than me, previously everyone had local admin rights, the IT infrastructure and AD was a total chaos, the CIO been implementing a lot of changes and as you'd expect, some people aren't happy about it, especially the guys from Technical services. We installed the AdminByRequest where they can request admin rights for a period of about 30miinutes. Well the war has been ongoing since then with lots of complaints. Just got an e-mail that someone tried installing a Siemans app that requires more than 30 minutes to install so half way through the installation, the process stops since the AdminByRequest is only valid for 30minutes.\n ​\n i stand to be corrected, but is admin right only needed to start the installation process? or is it required for the entire period of the installation?\n Also is there a better way to handle this? since they are insisting on having their local admin rights? how do you deal with this in your organization?\n Thanks for your time.\n    submitted by    /u/FearIsStrongerDanluv  \n [link]   [comments]",

And you can make adaptations and coping strategies. \n I genuinely feel that both these traits can be extremely beneficial in a sysadmin, if they're harnessed effectively.

I raised a Support Request with Mimecast over a week ago and have had no response at all, which is rubbish.\n So domain.com is currently in 365 TenantA with MX pointing directly to Microsoft and we will be bringing this domain into our 365 TenantB. We use Mimecast for our email security, so this domain will be added here too. My previous plan for these types of migrations has been:\n 1) Change MX of domain.com to something invalid. Emails will queue and retry at sender for an unknown period. 2) Add domain to 365 and add aliases. 3) Add domain to Mimecast and perform directory sync from 365 so Mimecast is aware of all the new aliases. 4) Change MX to Mimecast.\n This works well, with the exception of the unknown behaviour when switching to the bogus MX records.\n It got me wondering; is there a way with Mimecast that we could bring the domain in earlier, maybe even pre-migration, so that when I start the rip out of the domain from TenantA, Mimecast will queue email and then ultimately deliver when all the aliases are added to TenantB? Is that or something similar possible?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/brepmassive  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking for some recommendations on how to segment the network and also recommendations on securing the Guest network.\n We are going with Ubiquiti/Unifi equipment. When everything is all said and done we will have:\n  \nUDM/router\n POE Switch\n 4 WAPs\n 6 (or so) outside security cameras\n 1 badge reader for door access\n 1 video doorbell\n 6 smart TVs\n I think that's it but will update if I think of anything else\n  \nThe couple computers that are used only need internet access. There will not be a file server or the need to share files. All that is done through OneDrive/Teams which just needs internet.\n ​\n What recommendations would anyone have for different networks to have? I was envisioning possibly 3 networks:\n  \nMain Network\n Guest Network\n IOT Network (not sure if we need this one)\n  \nThe Main Network would be for all the stuff in the list about except the TVs.\n The Guest Network could be for the handful of computers they have. These could also go on the Main Network but I don't think there's any real need for that. Could go either way on this one. Smart devices could go here.\n The IOT Network could be for the TVs and any other \"smart\" devices that might get added down the road. Again, not sure if this is actually needed as these could just go on the Guest Network.\n ​\n The other question is, How would you recommend we secure the Guest Network?\n  \nWide Open - Company Computers would then go on the Main Network\n WPA Key - Post a key on a sign, people can connect to it just like any other network. Smart devices could go on this network\n Wide Open w/ Terms & Condition - Need to click \"I Agree\" like at a hotel - This is annoying at times and some equipment doesn't handle that sort of interface very well. Smart devices would probably need an IOT network then.\n  \n​\n Thanks for any input and ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/kelemvor33  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a test, we removed the group from Full Access and half an hour later, User A couldn't see private items anymore.\n I can't find anything online (feel free to perform better Google-fu) that suggests that MS have made this change and our mailboxes were migrated to EO a few years ago and there haven't been any recent changes that we've made.

The argument was basically that MFA doesn't stop your employer from monitoring your web traffic, technically correct, but misses the whole point of MFA.\n Do you guys have a ready response when people post stuff like this?

A few months ago I figured out he hasn't logged into the app in several months. Now that I am transitioning support to him, he only does support when specifically asked. No insightful questions, or how does XYZ work, or request for meetings to show feature ABC. I am the one who has to chase him to show him how to do things.\n During a critical issue where I was on the call with the vendor, the colleague seemed \"Away\" in Teams. I told my manager (tactfully) that I need to show my colleague how the issue was resolved, but he is away. Manager just said, \"Yes, continue to work with him and let him do the work\".\n I have a feeling this will come back to me some how.

Setting up servers, etc. I’ve always been SUPER into hardware (passion).\n But lately I’ve been setting up our new hosting servers for the company im at because they trusted me enough to move from managed hosting environment to rented servers where we manage the hosting ourselves.\n Most hosting clients are past clients where we made their sites. We host a few hundred but obviously want to increase.\n Im looking into collocation, but honestly I’m super surprised at the cost of servers. We are in South Africa so there aren’t many big DC providers. So only when we get a few servers would we look at collocation, but how “worth it” is hardware like Xeon CPU’s? I see there are now some new Intel consumer level CPUs that support ECC, and most new AMD CPUs support ECC. So for largely Wordpress and NodeJS environments is there an issue with going with AMD? Is there something I’m missing?\n Honestly I’m just not sure where to start with hardware, I’ve learnt what I can in theory, but real world reasons for certain choices, and advice is very different. \n This post was a bit of a ramble but I guess I’m just looking for any good nuggets from you pros 🙂\n    submitted by    /u/Jordz2203  \n [link]   [comments]",

So what could be the problem? I swear to God I configured every Vlan in the same way and I have deleted the lab and started again several times and happens the same issue.

We would prefer (though this is not essential) a single box and something that does not require subscriptions. One of the key requirements is that the stack has no single point of failure as we need to meet high uptime guarantees and so I am looking for something with a redundant power supply (I suppose 2 cheaper switches might be ok). We also need to be able to access the device management interfaces (iDRAC, IPMI) of devices on the internal network remotely and so need to have some facility to create a VPN (this seems preferable to a jump host). So, the requirements are: 1) Redundant power supply 2) Firewall 3) VPN 4) 10GbE minimum (SPF+ is preferred to RJ45) 5) <10 ports required\n Our main issue is that everything available that has redundant PSUs has 40+ ports and costs $$$. We only really need a single WAN port and 5 LAN ports (make that 10 to allow for expansion). Techbuyer have a useful product filter here: https://www.techbuyer.com/uk/catalog/category/view/s/network-switch-selector/id/482/ but all the results are switches with 40+ ports.

This will allow us to tell the phone system if network = 1.0.1.0/24 use e911 number 555-555-0001.\n Building A (with the firewall) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.1.0/24\n Building B (uplinks to Building A) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.2.0/24\n Building C (uplinks to either Building A or B) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.3.0/24 \n Currently all Buildings have a 'data' VLAN (1) using the subnet 1.0.0.0/24 \n IIRC, this can be done via VLAN Mapping or Translation? Not something i've every used. Unfortunately, our HPE OfficeConnect (1820/1920 mostly) switches don't seem to support this. (I hate these switches) \n My first thought was to create a VLAN on the firewall per building with a DHCP scope/relay and somehow convert that VLAN to the same phone vlan on the switch. However, I realized this isn't easily doable - I could connect two untagged ports together to accomplish this but, ew. \n My next thought would be to utilize the switches to handle VLAN 200 and set up a DHCP relay (our switches won't act as DHCP servers (nor do i think i want to manage that..) I believe all of our switches are Layer 3 lite - allowing for routing. This would work but i'd have to let the voice traffic traverse the data network and add in routes on the firewall to point to each network switch.. it sounds messy. \n Is there a solution that I'm not seeing to accomplish this?

Had issues trying to get the fiber link up. Tried rolling fiber at IDF. Tried rolling fiber at MDF. Tried different patch cable at IDF side. Now what worked was rolling at BOTH sides. Once that link came up (and at 10gig), I was like - that doesn't make sense so we tested and rolled them both back and tried all other combinations, fail.\n Fast forward to tonight. Same site, different IDF, same MDF switch. Link wouldn't come up after new gear was in. I said let's roll both sides at the same time. Link came up. What the hell?\n The only thing I can think of is - at the MDF side, fiber patch cables are orange, but there's about a foot of distance leading starting at its LC connector where ONE of the strands turns yellow. Where it transitions orange, there's about 2 inches of some sort of shrink wrap and the cable gets slightly bulkier there. The other strand is orange the whole way. It looks factory made. I haven't been able to find an image of those online. \n Who know what's going on here?\n    submitted by    /u/thuhreb  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All,\n I work for a MSP and we're thinking of trying to replace some Cisco VDSL modems with the Proscend VDSL2 SFP, just trying to wrap my head around the potential configurations that we might use for this.\n Our current plan is to stick the SFP into the switch for the clients (Most clients only have 1-2 switches, generally a Cisco of some sort, 24-48 ports with 2-4 SFP ports.) and then setting one single SFP and one single RJ45 port into their own VLAN and using that to bridge the SFP Modem with WAN interface on the router. However, for the router to connect to the ISP over this SFP modem, it requires tagging a VLAN on the WAN interface.\n If we were to set the SFP and RJ45 ports to access ports to some random VLAN - e.g. 2000, and then set the router to tag VLAN2 on the WAN port, would the switch see the VLAN2 tag on these access ports and then just strip the VLAN tag?\n One of our other options is just a SFP to RJ45 media converter, but then that requires extra plugs, and an extra point if failure, not to mention more cost rather than just plugging the SFP into a switch and partitioning the switch out, not as costly as a router but a cost that the client would need to bear.\n Alternatively, we could just upgrade all of our clients to routers with SFP ports, but then we're going to need to convince the clients to put the money in to upgrade their routers in the cases where they don't already have routers with SFP ports.\n Any opinions on the best way forward while still being cost efficient?\n Thanks all!\n    submitted by    /u/SirLagz  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's really simple with the CATV headend (digital QAM modulator) and we pipe in our licensed channels to it in addition to a few in house channels for signage and information. We're making a new dormitory that will be all ethernet and no coax to the room to use simple digital CATV enabled TVs. \n It appears the hospitality IPTV market is large from fancy ones that have splash pages that welcome you with customized information to your room. I do notice that at the hotels a lot of them have set top boxes behind the hospitality TV and this seems complex. I feel like buying hospitality grade smart TVs will lock us in or perhaps the set top box is the way to go? How much do these systems cost to maintain and license? is it even worth it?\n I really like the simplicity of coax CATV, just scan for new channels (the channel plan rarely changes) and go, so I can just push to get coax installed in the new dorm to each room and extend CATV to the dorm with HFC fiber. Change my mind?\n One possible driving factor for IPTV is to also allow users to watch IPTV on their desktop or mobile devices. I can technically hit the multicast IP on the distribution side (source to QAM modulator) and watch it in VLC but it's not too user friendly. I don't know how many users would actually watch our channels on mobile. I have tested Haivison's HMP product and have always wondered if there are competition products to this.

We're being charged $400 a month for the 50x50 line itself (In the city), along with additional costs for things like a managed firewall. We've had stability issues quite frequently in the past with this line, but the stability seems to be better now. \n 50mb/s is not meeting our needs though. I understand the high cost is to guarantee these minimum speeds, though our speeds don't seem to really ever go above that. A shared line could give us 20 times the speeds for a quarter of the price. I would think that the 50mb/s is a minimum amount of bandwidth we'd get, shouldn't we still be able to get higher speeds despite them not being guaranteed? Or are we being capped at that 50mb mark? It seems like that 50mb/s minimum is our maximum, which seems a bit absurd. I'm not really sure if we're being throttled at that bandwidth. \n If spectrum doesn't throttle dedicated lines at their guaranteed speeds, I suppose another cause may be the managed firewall that we have with them. It seems to be an older model, and from my knowledge it is performing tasks like Deep Packet Inspection. \n We also use a shared building, with 2 other tenants in it. By paying for a dedicated line, would the other tenants in the building be using that line? From the agreement we signed, it looks like there are 3 address entries with the same address, so it seems plausible that we may not be getting that dedicated access, and that this may be a cost we should talk to the landlord about. \n These are the theories I've come up with so far.

My problem is just figuring out the failover situation during an ISP failover without using an edge switch or routers.\n Basically ISP1 would connect to the active SRX and ISP2 would connect to the passive SRX. My goal is to have it failover to the Passive SRX and ISP2, if ISP1 is down (i.e bgp down, link down etc...). I am thinking IP monitoring would be best for this situation. But I wanted to see if someone here has done something like this that maybe has a better way of doing it or if I am missing something?\n ​\n Other questions:\n  \nWith an active/passive cluster, anything connected to the passive SRX never passes traffic, so presumably the BGP session with ISP2 would never come up until a failover occurs, correct? \n With IP monitoring, if I wanted to fail back to ISP1 I presume that has to be done manually?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/alexb2746  \n [link]   [comments]",

The company has been upgrading all of the networking equipment for our relatively small on-premise server/domain, but I'm still running into issues with RDP accessed through the client VPN provided through a Cisco Meraki MX64 SD-WAN.\n The RDP/VPN connection seems to struggle mostly with video but it also sometimes drops for no real apparent reason.

The connection can cope when I'm just doing office work but seems to push latency tests (performed via testmy.net/latency) on my local machine into the 200-300ms on certain video calls.\n I'm not hoping to pin down a specific cause with these tests, but would highly appreciate any insight into where I should look further.\n Pings to Local Node: https://imgur.com/a/rLRWWAg\n MTR to Local Node: https://imgur.com/a/BughVsE\n Traceroute to Google: https://imgur.com/a/0f9rwWR\n MTR to Google: https://imgur.com/a/OYeO7Iu\n    submitted by    /u/act3297  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm new to RDMA technology, and I'm confused by several rdma libraries. I cannot figure out the relationship among them. The libraries and kernel headers I'm confused with are as follows: \n 1.rdma-core/libibverbs\n 2.rdma-core/librdmacm\n 3.linux-5.4.2/include/rdma\n 4.linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi/rdma\n My question is: \n 1.As far as I know. libibverbs provides the userspace applications with verbs api(i.e. functions with prefix ibv_), but it does not offer any connection-related functions, so applications need to exchange connection information using sockets(I see this operation in the libibverbs example rc_pingpong.c). librdmacm provides the user with easier connection management mechanism(e.g. rdma_get_cm_event). However, it seems that librdmacm does more work than connection management, since it also defines several apis(e.g. rdma_create_qp in rdma_cma.h) which looks similar to the ibv_function in libibverbs. So I do not know whether librdmacm is a superset of libibverbs? If not, what's the relationship between them?\n 2.In the example rc_pingpong.c of libibverbs, I cound see it includes the header file verbs.h, and it seems that linux-5.4.2/include/rdma and linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi do not play any role in the program(no heaer files in these two directories are included). So what are the header files in these two directories aimed at? \n I have refer to several materials but have not made it clear. Any explanation or related resources are well-appreciated.

The difference between them is that in one case there is active nexthop IP, and in other there is none. Nexthop is connected through a bridge, therefore it's impossible to use link state to check if nexthop is available or not. The single way is to check if it can be resolved via arp.\n There are other ways to solve my problem (healthchecks, hooks into openstack code, etc), but I wanted to investigate feasibility of the nexthop 'resolving' (in this context, resolving of IP into MAC, i.e. arp).

Another fun fact about this network is that the original designer tagged Vlan 1 on all uplink ports. Of course Vlan 1 is still also the default & native vlan throughout the network. Our main data subnet, cameras and door controls are all on Vlan 1 across the entire company.\n The project requirement is to implement department vlans at our main site and have a few other vlans at other remote sites as needed. Of course they want to move the cameras off the data subnet and also use vlans for IOT, printers, and a few other departments at some sites.\n Our WAN is connected using AT&T Metro ASE Layer 2. We have an Aruba 3810 L3 Switch as the gateway at each site. IP Routing is enabled on each of these L3 Switches.\n We have 12 remote sites, STP is in use at each site, but we only connect using static routes. No ospf, rip, bgp, etc.\n My initial thought is to first install all of the new subnets/vlans throughout the network. Then slowly begin moving the Vlan 1 devices over to the new subnets. We have a server team that will handle most of the systems that will need their IP changed so my main task is to ensure connectivity.\n How would you handle moving users off of Vlan 1 onto the new subnets? For all you L2 WAN folks, is there a better way to approach this?\n I appreciate your thoughts & inputs.\n    submitted by    /u/Sully-Trails  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are around 8 ubiquiti 'enterprise' switches in the network and a few APs. \n I would like to replace the firewall with something a bit more manageable and feature rich. Naturally i'm thinking of Fortinet etc for the price but I've also seen the Dream Machine Pro from Ubiquiti which has the features we need at a really low price (I assume it's not a great unit...) and would allow me to manage the rest of our switches centrally. You can't even monitor traffic on the switches without a gateway anyway which sucks so I'm tempted to go down this route instead.\n If the dream machine pro supported openvpn for remote workers I would grab it but it doesn't so I'm still hesitant. \n Do you guys think it's better to grab an actual enterprise level switch from Fortinet or maybe a pfsense plus box from netgate instead of a dream machine pro?\n    submitted by    /u/Barrerayy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Cisco ASA router managing DHCP > 16-port dumb switch > 4 port switch(es)\n https://imgur.com/a/nrG2JcM for a basic network diagram\n Had an issue where *out of nowhere, after years of this setup* the Cisco ASA got flooded with 169.254 addresses and killed the network. \n I know what you're thinking - why the f*** do you have such cheap dumb ass unmanaged networking equipment for a 30 user environment? Because we're cheap and stupid and have no money. Believe me I've tried. I don't want to go any further into my thoughts in case of this post being found to be honest, but it is not a favourable position I am in.\n Anyways,\n I figured there was maybe a network loop happening, with this being just as the office was closing I got everyone to leave and I powered everything off. I determined that 1 small switch with 2 computers hanging off it was tripping the network when powered back on. The other switches/computers were repowered and are OK.\n The 2 computers appear fine, like I have pretty detailed software inventories using our endpoint protection agent, and indeed plugging the laptops in elsewhere, no issue.\n This is where I am out of diagnosis, knowledge, experience and wit. So I guess I can blame the switch being worth about $10, but why would it be spamming 169.254 addresses?\n I have now plugged the \"faulty\" switch in elsewhere and it no longer trips the network. Has this been a red herring all along?\n Moral of story is - we need better equipment so I can actually see which ports/devices these addresses were coming from. But I am still in the sad situation where I cannot properly explain the outage, so hoping for ideas.\n ***Disclaimer. I bring this post with great humility, regret and pleading forgiveness.

My understanding now is that it's basically trying to send the IKE and ESP traffic etc over a tunnel that doesn't exist yet.\n ​\n So I've done a little bit of research and it sound like I have to have a static route that goes to the ISP still, but at a lower priority:\n 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop eth1.4 172.0.0.2 (isp) Priority 15\n for the IKE/ESP traffic for tunnel creation.\n ​\n Then have another route for all other traffic (local subnet and Internet) with a higher priority, so local office traffic flows as before and so Internet traffic can pass to Prisma/HQ for inspection.\n 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop tunnel.1 Priority 10\n ​\n The tunnel traffic is also using BGP, the traffic to the ISP is not.\n ​\n Any insight and/or corrections welcome!

Here's what it says:\n \"The global BPDU filter configuration uses the command spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default, and the port sends a series of 10 to 12 BPDUs. If the switch receives any BPDUs, it checks to identify which switch is more preferred.\n ■ The preferred switch does not process any BPDUs that it receives, but it still transmits BPDUs to inferior downstream switches.\n ■ A switch that is not the preferred switch processes BPDUs that are received, but it does not transmit BPDUs to the superior upstream switch\"\n My understanding is that when BPDU filter is configured globally it applies to all portfast ports and if a port receives a BPDU it converts to a regular STP port. Applied at the interface and it basically stops the port from participating in STP. \n I feel like it's just explaining regular STP operation but I'm confused by the wording.\n    submitted by    /u/BookooBreadCo  \n [link]   [comments]",

The ASA does not always have the IP address in the DNS cache to which the FQDN on the server was resolved. Server and the ASA have exactly the same DNS server set up. Unfortunately, I am unable to obtain a complete list of the IP addresses of the subnets to which the FQDN is resolved, so traffic needs to be filtered to FQDN. I have noticed that the FQDN on the server changes every 30-40 seconds or so, and on the ASA in the DNS cache I see a TTL for the FQDN of up to 2 minutes. Does anyone have any idea how to solve this so that in the DNS cache on the ASA the FQDN address is always the same as on the server? I know that the server first resolves the FQDN and then with the IP address it gets from DNS it goes to ASA.

Apparently they cover construction costs as well up to 10K for dedicated lines but not sure what's involved. Does this look on par with typical dedicated business fiber rates? If we have a Business Fan account with cellular lines, can you somehow get a package or deal of some sort when adding fiber? I heard there were some sort package deals with fiber, but unsure if it applies to dedicated or just residential. Also, would it be possible to ask them or the 3rd party contractor to lay OS2 single mode cable (vs cat6) as it's more future proof?

They are using all Ubiquiti/Unifi equipment for firewall, switch, Wifi, etc. I'm wondering what others recommend for how to handle a Guest network.\n People will come in every weekend for a service and we want to have wifi available. Device Isolation and bandwidth throttling will definitely be enabled regardless of the options below. I've come up with 3 options for handling the Guest access:\n  \nPortal - Unifi has a portal available where you have to tap \"I Agree\" in order to use wifi. This does not require a password of any kind, which is nice, but some devices don't play well with those type of portals\n WPA Key - We could print a passcode on a sign and post them around the building (it's a small building). People enter that and get on the wifi. Pretty straight forward. Could change the password every once in a while if needed.\n Open - No password, no portal, just join and away you go. Most user friendly but least secure.\n  \nJust curious what others do, or would do, in a situation like this.\n Thank!\n    submitted by    /u/kelemvor33  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems like when i try to access the devices web gui it can take several minutes to load. We have appx 30 switches on this chain.\n Any info would be appreciated it.\n ​\n Hope someone can help me out!\n ​\n Thanks\n ​\n Here is some more details.\n Switches are 5 Port or 8 Port Gigabit POE SwitchesDevices - Hikvision Cameras 10/100 POE\n The switches are daisy chained one to the next to the next etc\n CAT6 Cable between the longest switch is less than 100m.\n    submitted by    /u/KohanIT  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all, \n I'm setting up a business 10GbE internal network using a Synology DS1821+ with (8) 16TB 7200 Seagate EXOS drives and two 10GbE RJ45 ports in the rear. This is for a video production company that wants the maximum data throughput to their devices since they frequently edit 4k 120fps uncompressed footage. My plan is to run both 10GbE ports from the Synology to a QNAP QSW M1208-8C through RJ45 to SFP+ adapters, then connect my 8 users to the switch through the remaining (8) RJ-45 ports with Cat6 Cable (all less than 75 foot runs). Additionally, I was planning to connect their modem to the switch using a 1GbE RJ45 to SFP adapter since their current internet speeds are 500/500. \n My current issue is that I can't find a compatible 10GbE or 1GbE adapter that QNAP lists as compatible with the network switch. Would a generic adapter from FS suffice? Is compatibility required?\n My second issue is future expandability. With the NAS and the internet modem taking up of the (3) SFP ports using adapters, the remaining (8) RJ45/SPF combo 10GbE ports are taken up by the (8) users with RJ45 CAT6 cables. Would the smartest move when it's time to expand be to daisy-chain another switch in through the SFP port? Or purchase a new switch that has more ports?\n My third question is regarding bottlenecks. In each of the computers we have PCIE network cards that are rated for at least 5GbE, most 10GbE. Will our bottleneck be the computer connection or the speed of the Synology in RAID 6? Either way we should have plenty of bandwidth for editing 4k/120fps uncompressed, but I want to be getting the maximum throughput possible out of this system. \n Thanks so much in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/USBub  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since release 16 is probably not rolled out by mobile network operators I was wondering if it is even possible to buy rel.16 compatible device in advance. My concerns arise from specific features promised by 3GPP rel.16 for example Integrated Access and Backhaul, CV2X (Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything) which doesnt sound like regular 5G features therefore would require specific modems, right? Another thing is that for example Mikrotik on its product page doesnt even specify specific 3GPP release, only available 5G bands which I think indicates that this release doesnt even matter and this model will be compatible with future versions of 5G. Is that correct?\n I guess my question boils down to - is there any public information from MNO vendors wheter these 3GPP features will even be enabled and if they will be - can I buy hardware for it in advance?\n    submitted by    /u/aaartis1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should I stick it out at my current company (10yrs seniority) and hope for the best and gain as much experience I can as a Cloud Manager….which isn’t a lot of hands on exposure.\n On the other hand I go into work each day fearing for my job, I’m not happy, and I’m starting to worry that if I wait too long the job market might shift shortly that might result in limited opportunities.\n Looking for the opinion of my peers 😊\n    submitted by    /u/albert00712  \n [link]   [comments]",

All good! \n The issue is that due to the point to point interface and VRRP that if the point to point dies so site1 can no longer reach site2 using the point to point that you would want that traffic to go out via the WAN into the MPLS to reach the other site. \n The problem is of course it won't do that due to each of the Cisco routers having LAN's which belong to both subnets. So if traffic was going from Site1 to Site2 then as soon as those packets destined for 192.168.0.0/24 hit the Site1 router then it would just not send it out's its WAN as it has an interface belonging to that subnet which is up and part of the VRRP group. \n This is the problem I'm trying to solve. A solution which I don't like is to create a EMM script which will shut down that LAN in the event traffic is no longer using the P2P but I don't like how messy that could be. \n Anyone got any ideas or suggestions then I'm open to them :) \n I hope that made at least some sense?\n    submitted by    /u/Busbyuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a small-ish site that provides Internet or managed network access to a few hundred remote SATCOM terminals via a small number of high bandwidth uplinks. My background is in radio networking (MANET, microwave, trunked voice & data, etc) but I'm fairly competent with Cisco R&S gear.\n This site has been badly neglected and is in acute need of a tech refresh. It currently has about 12-14 access switches and six routers that manage IP traffic between the modems and other infrastructure, and an old ASA that connects to the Internet and provides remote access via AnyConnect. I plan to replace the switches and routers pretty quickly, and the firewall soon after.\n I'm going to write a preliminary proposal to outline the tech refresh project and justify funding for subsequent trade studies and eventual capital purchase.\n Now for my question: I'm a little turned off by Cisco's extremely high prices, the complexity of their feature licensing, and also their super long lead times right now. I have positive impressions towards Juniper and Extreme gear, though my experience with them is limited. Given the relative simplicity of this network, I've wondered if I could get by using Ubiquiti or Mikrotik, but ultimately I think we'll want a paid support option. Assuming a homogeneous environment meaningfully reduces complexity and risk, is there a single brand that might be best suited for this application?\n    submitted by    /u/HotNastySpeed77  \n [link]   [comments]",

As these networks get bigger we run in to topology problems trying to maintain HA/resiliency/redundancy.\n It gets very awkward when your network is down, the show is stopped and you have a live audience of 20000 people and millions watching on television.\n Most networks end up as a ring (with RSTP or EAPS), or as one long daisy-chain (broken ring). Some folks will run parallel links (that are unconnected until one fails and then the spare gets manually plugged in)\n It looks like TRILL would have been a solution, but it seems that it really never took off, so I am looking at routing solutions.\n Requirements: fast convergence times, once routers are configured the first time: plug and play operation in the field, loop/feedback protection, mesh ability, and the endpoints see all local broadcast traffic.\n From what I gather OSPF/EVPN/VXLAN might be the solution?!?

The two commands both accept every VLAN configured on the switch on the trunk ports. So my question is, if there are any disadvantages for network, when the trunks are configured in that way instead of specifying the exact VLANs. We have some delays and higher TTLs in our network and/or some black magic we can't figure out. So my boss hat the opinion its caused by the trunk all command. Is that true? We are talking about a VLAN configuration of 20-30 VLANs.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/sn0oz3  \n [link]   [comments]",

The maximum could be reached in a few next years. So this is not very good. Filter all /24 prefixes would be a workaround for future, but it could bring some new un expected problems, so we're looking very carefully to this.\n Cisco NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S - It has 36x100G with Extended scale for prefixes - support 4millions of prefixes, but seems too expensive.\n Maybe you know so other models would be not so expensive as NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S ?

          "description": "Hello\n I have some networking knowledge and experience, but I am still growing my skills and advancing my career. \n I was thinking about how layer 3 switching for interVLAN routing is more efficient and quicker due to the ASICs and such for routing traffic between VLANs compared to a standard firewall with inspection and such. But layer 3 switching ACLs are very basic and doesn't allow any sort of traffic inspection/analysis. \n Firewalls have all the great security features for traffic inspection and analysis, but can the bottleneck/slower for interVLAN routing to internal systems.\n One scenario I can think of is; lets say you have a media department (10+ people) that works with a lot of large files and directly edits off a network share through a 10gb link connected to their desktops. Using a firewall to separate the server network and their desktop network (as well as all the other standard user networks) may be the bottleneck when it comes to those connections but more secure for internal threats. Layer 3 switching would be faster, but way less security to defend against internal threats as well as more complicated to maintain with ACLs the larger the distribution layer grows. Or is this just a money problem and a beefier firewall should be purchased to handle something like this?\n I guess the question is, at what point do you choose firewall or layer 3 switch for interVLAN routing and ensuring the network is properly secure and why?\n    submitted by    /u/clifford641  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't understand why this is happening, because to my knowledge both protocols calculate the route with the same SPF algorithm, and in the point-to-point setting both skip the DR/BDR and DIS selection step. Research is done on the same equipment, repeated many times, the trend is always the same. Could someone explain where the better result for IS-IS might be coming from?\n    submitted by    /u/Warg13  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems that VLAN 5 (LAB VLAN) is not traversing the link between the two switches (port 24 on main switch & port 15 on office switch), although VLAN 1 does just fine.\n If I plug my laptop into port 5 on the main switch (untagged VLAN 5), it successfully pulls a DHCP address from the VLAN 5 interface on my router connected to the main switch (ports 3-4, LAGG, tagged VLAN 5).\n If I try to plug the laptop into any of the 6 x VLAN 5 ports (ports 1-6, untagged on office switch) it will not pull a DHCP address and cannot ping the VLAN 5 router interface (10.71.17.254) if I set the address manually.\n I am including screenshots of all applicable switch and router settings.\n I would really appreciate any help I could get from you fine people.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/BJWTech  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently, when starting the computer do not get into the network. Only some do not find the network. And it may be that this does not occur every day. We have a DHCP server which distributes the IP addresses. Sometimes computers just don't get an IP address and they get a default IP and are not in the domain because they can't find the DNS and DHCP server. The workaround is when you unplug the network cable and plug it back in or turn the PC off and on again. Both does not always work and you have to test which variant works. Of the 250 computers, not always the same computers are affected, but different ones. Now my consideration is to give each computer a fixed IP address, there is otherwise no solution. Is it usual with a company size to give the computers fixed IP addresses? Or is a DHCP server the better choice?

We've been using the CSV tool within the Configuration piece in the GUI and importing static tags with the format <mac addr>, <policy-tag>, <site-tag>, <rf-tag>. After we upload the CSV and point the APs to the 9800, they come up perfectly as designed.\n ​\n As we look to move wider chunks of APs, I want to make sure this work is done in advance of moving the APs. Cisco has said there is no way to dump all this IF the AP is not actively on the controller. This doesn't sound right since it's stored somewhere in the controller for when the AP does eventually join.

The buildings have fiber, but they want a redundant link to avoid downtime. Apparently there's some upcoming construction and the boss is worried the fiber may get accidentally get cut in construction. \n I've installed the Ubiquiti Power beam on each building and connected each end to a Cisco switch. I am using the PoE injectors. \n In the testing phase, the PtP is working fine. The warehouse end comes out of a trunk port on the Cisco Switch, go through a PoE injector, then wireless goes across the parking lot to the admin building and then comes through another PoE injector. \n If you plug a laptop straight to the injector, it joins you to the LAN. If you put an unmanaged switch on the injector, and then plug in, you're on the LAN. \n But if you run the injector into the second switch, it doesn't go anywhere. The CLI doesn't even show the port (port 2) as active. \n What am I missing? I have full access to the switches, but I don't really have a good background of Cisco Training.\n Ideally, I'd like both links to be active, so if the fiber broke, the PtP would keep everything online, and I believe STP would prevent a loop, if activated. \n If all else fails, it's fine if the PtP stays unplugged from the switch until actually needed. \n I've tested it both with the fiber plugged and unplugged, and it does not make a difference.\n    submitted by    /u/Ezra611  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm not entirely understanding what the best practice is for managing VLANs, subnets, and broadcast domains is when designing an enterprise LAN. \n Here's a basic LAN segment to reference throughout this post.\n Across an organization, let's assume that at that a small size site with a single switch has VLAN 69 specified for interfaces connecting to PCs. \n At a larger site, there will be multiple switches connecting to a central core switch (or switch cluster), which then connected upstream to a router (router-on-a-stick). If I deploy VLAN 69 on both of the access switches, despite them being in different subnets, the trunk links connecting the access switches to the core switch will expand my broadcast domain to include both of these networks. The L3 traffic will be contained to whatever the mask is set to (in this case, the two /24s as shown in the diagram), but the L2 traffic will include all three switches and the LAN-facing router interface. \n Q: Is it possible to keep the broadcast domain limited to the scope of only the respective /24 networks without having to specify two separate VLAN IDs, or do I have to make one of the switches operate on a different VLAN ID? \n If separate VLAN IDs are required, how do you best design your VLAN deployments?

The students and professor are complaining about the wifi. \n The distribution of clients heavily favors 2 APs. One 5Ghz radio had 35; the other had 30. Other APs in the area had 0-10 clients. I have tried adjusting the power levels and will do further tests to try to determine why so many APs are favoring 1-2 5GHz radios when there are 4+ more to choose from in the immediate area. \n This lecture hall has tables for each row so the clients aren't as densely packed as you're imagining and the APs are evenly distributed overhead. The only way to fit ~100 people in this room is to have an even distribution of bodies in seats. I think that rules out favoring 1-2 radios based on proximity.

Can see the internet, can ping other VLans. Routing is working fine, DHCP to a new test Server is working fine, and DNS is working fine. \n The issue is that on the core switch we're getting that error %IP-4-DUPADDR: Duplicate address which is seeing the downlink interface MAC as assigned to the Gateway IP for the Meraki Management VLan, but that Gateway IP is also assigned to the SVI on the Core Switch (Cisco 4500x). \n You can easily see this by either pinging outside from the Windows Server (Google DNS is the main test IP), but it's the same from the Windows Server to the 4500x (Pure Storage -> Nexus -> 4500x). But pinging from the 4500x to the ASA it fails not at all. \n I believe that by removing BDPU Guard on the 2960S downlink interface so I could attach the Meraki I should also enable Root Guard on the Meraki to allow BDPU frames to flow down and to not have the Meraki think the uplink interface is the root bridge in its little STP brain. \n Any assistance would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/GreenChileEnchiladas  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the firewalls and routers I tested on the connection all had the new IP and gateway set. On each, packets hit the router, hit the old gateway ip, then went on their way. All show the new public static. \n I'm not sure if that's the cause of the bandwidth issues we're having (though I believe I've conclusively ruled out anything on our end causing it unless like 6 different routers/firewalls with no extra configs have the same issue). \n Anyone seen an ISP route you through the wrong gateway regardless of the config on your end? Definitely a first for me.\n    submitted by    /u/BrokeTokeBloke  \n [link]   [comments]",

One is local to the switch, same subnet, etc. The other is a remote host in Azure, with a port forward for this specific IP to translate TCP 2222 to 22 to this test switch. The local Ansible server appears to start SCP sessions as intended. No problems, nothing in the logs to indicate any problem, multiple 40 mb files transferred. The remote one is able to open a SSH connection, but SCP sessions fail. \n I have turned debugging on in the switch and while I do see the remote Ansible server is able to start a session, there is little to nothing in the log to indicate a problem.

          "description": "So we have been having issues with a switch we recently put into place in a building on our base. The setup is as follows....\n Core switch > 3850 fiber switch > 3560 access switch\n With this setup, we have been having some problems and we believe they are related to AAA. Our AAA server is ISE and it is doing TACACS as well as RADIUS and MAB for clients.\n The failures seem to be intermittent, but basically out of 4 clients, only 2 of them will authenticate. The other 2 are not failing authentication, but the MACs are also not showing up anywhere. Its like they aren't even there, even though the interface is up. The 2 devices will briefly be put into the correct VLAN, but then after a minute or so, they go back into our \"black hole\" vlan, and nothing about them shows up in the switch logs or ISE logs. \n So my question is, could the issue be the fact that we are daisy chaining the 3560 and not going directly to our core switch? My boss seems to think that a setup like this is not how networking should be done. I do agree that it probably is not best practice, but I feel like the issue would be more so if the 3850 switch can handle the load of traffic going over it. Would there be any special type of configuration that needs done with a setup like this, besides just configuring a normal trunk port?\n Another thing that just popped up is we noticed that we have \"switchport block unicast\" on the trunk ports. We referenced another network that we managed and on that network, we only have that command on the access ports. Could that possibly be causing the inconsistent authentication errors?\n    submitted by    /u/Nats_daddy  \n [link]   [comments]",

We maintain a sd wan network with remote sites all over the world and one of them was complaining about a server not being reachable intermittently, this server is accessed by this site only so we only got this complaint from them, interestingly, we are able to ping this server once or twice successfully from Site A core switch, but the rest of the attempts fail to reach for some time, then works again and so forth, meanwhile site B is able to reach it the same time A couldn't, the same thing happens when trying from B when B couldn't reach while A could, this is not a packet loss issue btw, when it pings, it pings perfectly without latency or loss even 10k reps, but when it fails, it fails completely. I understand the issue has to be with the server, but can't figure out what, probably multiple session related, I would like to know if you guys have experienced any such issues, Im not deeply experienced myself but haven't come across this issue.\n    submitted by    /u/Vlafir  \n [link]   [comments]",

What happens when a link drop/trace disconnect occurs when there are several successors but no FS (all the routes have the same metric)? Is the algorithm not activated and just the next successors take the place of the predecessor, or is the algorithm being ran and the successors are recalculated?\n Edit: Maybe I have not specified enough, I mean such a specific case as in the screenshot. It is a route from R2 to R7, R2 has 3 tracks, all are successors (each link has the same cost) and no FS. If the link between R2 and R3 fails, will one of the two other successors be added to the routing table immediately, or will the algorithm restart and recalculate the routes?\n https://imgur.com/a/oSr0HaK\n    submitted by    /u/Vip3Out  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have a small network with a file server, Unifi edgerouter and UAP 2.4/5 access point. Because of the nature of the nonprofit's work, specialists need to bring their work laptops in and out and switch rooms frequently, and so hardwiring really isn't an option. Recently, users have been getting disconnected from the wifi intermittently in the afternoons between about 2 and 4. I added a second AP to a corner of the office where a lot of interruptions were reported, but it hasn't seemed to help. I've tried different channels, as it is a crowded environment, but no luck, and the APs automatically choose channels in normal operation anyway). I've confirmed that it isn't an issue with the network itself; hardwired devices work fine, and network activity appears normal. The issue is disconnection from the access points. I've spoken to several of our neighbors; a next-door neighbor reports the same thing, the one on the other side doesn't. \n I'm wondering if there's some kind of RF interference that's causing this, but I'm at a loss as to how to track it down. The issue of whether it's a 2.4ghz vs 5ghz issue is a bit murky to me, since (as is common) the two bands share the same SSID, so it's difficult to know which one a device is connecting to. The building is kind of a beast, so the 5ghz AP doesn't penetrate walls well.

Our setup is this....\n Core > 3850 fiber switch > 3560 switch\n All switches are using ISE for tacacs.\n The issue is with the 3rd switch that is not connected directly to the core. It will sometimes let us log in with the usernames we have saved on ISE, and then sometimes those wont work and we will have to use the local account that is setup on the switch as an account of last resort. \n When we have the login issues, all the switch logs tell us is that authentication has failed with that username. We don't see any logs about losing connection to ISE or anything like that. Just the username authentication failures. \n When we look at ISE, we do not see the authentication failures, all we see are the successful authentications. So that tells me that when we are having the authentication issues, we some how are losing connection to ISE because these failures are not shown. \n We are also using ISE for RADIUS and doing client authentication with MAB. Clients are also losing their authentication intermittently. Same thing though, this failure is not shown on ISE.\n This issue only occurs with the switch that is \"daisy chained\" and not directly connected to the core. And again, nothing in the logs indicating a loss with the ISE server.\n Does anyone have any idea what could be the issue? We are on a webex with TAC at the moment, but seem to not be getting anywhere. My assumption is that the daisy chained switch is some how losing connection to ISE, but again not seeing any logs indicating this.

One of my classmates was giving me shit about how it wouldn't be able to handle internal traffic for 50 users and handle the SSL/TLS Decryption and other features. I'm not sure if he's blowing smoke up my ass or what... I would like to try and prove him wrong but I don't really have any metrics as to what kind of internal traffic we would be handling - as it's all theoretical. \n Which leads me to my question. Is it common practice for small / medium sized businesses to buy separate equipment for their router and firewall? Is it really not reasonable to have a FW of that caliber do the internal routing?

Unplugging and plugging back in doesn't work neither does changing to another static IP (same vlan). If you change the vlan and slap on a different IP, it'll ping; then if you change it back to the original vlan, it'll still ping. \n The one thing in common with all of these issues is that the mac address does not appear on the switch it's connected to (different switches/models/locations).

Also the VXLAN tunnels seems to be up, with the command \"sh int vxlan 1\" i can see the other vtep-peer IP adn MAC address on the other side of the topology. I'm going through the process following guides and the official Aruba documentation https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.07/PDF/5200-7890.pdf\n Onto the switches which are vteps i've created vlan 50 and associated it to vni 100. Then i went on the interfaces where i have VirtualPCs attached, i put them in \"no routing\" and then into \"vlan access 50\" (obv i enter \"no shutdown\" command). So this is only L2 configuration, no routing interested here. I gave ip addresses to the vpcs 172.16.0.10/24 and 172.16.0.15 /24. They're in the same subnet but CANNOT ping, giving me \"host not reachable\" as feedback.\n I replicated the vlan configuration on Aruba CX 10.04.0001 version (which NOT support vxlan interfaces) and worked, the vpcs can ping each other.\n Is this a bug for the Aruba CX Virtual 10.07.0004 version or i have misconfigured something? Anyone had same issue? \n [EDIT] Probably i can confirm it is a BUG.

Cost isn't an issue as it's fake and the budget is almost irrelevant, just need to justify the design. \n I'm in a networking course and part of the class is to design a medium-sized business network.

So I apologize for this low level question but I have 0 real-world experience. The assignment specifies cat5e.\n My question is, when running the cat5e cables out, is there a standard number of cables per destination (to rooms, workstations, etc.), or should it be exactly as many as needed? Is it 1:1 end component per cable (like if a room is expected to have 5 PCs, should there be 5 cat5s, extra? twice as many?)?\n I've tried googling this and watched videos of people but I still haven't figured out a specific answer.

I was wondering if there are any straightforward parsing methods I could apply to a capture file that might simulate an IDS but instead using Pyshark?

Guy in remote office was moving furniture and not only found an 8 port cisco switch plugged in (not documented by people before me) but unplugged the POE on the bridge. Whatever, right?\n My entire network hiccuped for a good 5-10 seconds. HP Switches show entry of ‘Unit 1 elected as new STP root’. Ok.\n So, for the fun of it, I had the guy unplug the Ethernet on the POE, just to see what happens…and sure enough, 4-8 pings drop on my entire network. \n I would have thought nothing would have happened on my end of things (main office), but it did. I want to blame this old cisco SG250 switch, which I looked up and shows STP on out of the box. But Im not sure.\n Ive ordered up a new HP switch to replace it, and it should be here in a few days, but im just wondering what is going on and asking you guys for some insight if you have any.

          "description": "I apologize if this has been asked before, but trying to search this topic I am finding a lot of results not exactly related to my questions that have been bothering me the past few days.\n I am having a difficult time comprehending the difference between untagged and \"no-untagged\" on an HP switch. I want to be sure I am understanding what the configuration means, and I'm not just continuing to copy what I see just because it works. I do understand how vlans and tagging work for forward traffic and separate it between different subnets. Something \"tagged\" for a vlan I understand fine. But when doing a show run on an HP switch, I am seeing the labels \"no untagged\" and \"untagged\" listed, and that is throwing me off. \n When I see the words \"no untagged\" it makes me think that a port that is untagged cannot be part of this vlan (therefore only tagged ports can go here), and untagged means they are not part of that vlan. But then again, why would anyone need to specify a port is untagged? Wouldn't it be implied it is untagged on that vlan unless it is manually tagged?\n Below is an example (keep in mind, I didn't set these up):\n vlan 1\n name \"DEFAULT_VLAN\"\n no untagged 1-22,25-52\n untagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 5\n name \"MGMT\"\n tagged 23-24\n exit\n vlan 9\n name \"PC\"\n untagged 1-2,4-10,12-15,18-22,26-40\n tagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 10\n name \"DATA\"\n untagged 3,11,16-17,25,41-52\n tagged 1,23-24,28-40\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 11\n name \"VOICE\"\n tagged 1,23-24,26-40\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 12\n name \"SecWIFI\"\n tagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 13\n name \"GuestWIFI\"\n tagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n    submitted by    /u/This_guy_works  \n [link]   [comments]",

Keep in mind I'm a junior sysadmin at best so I'll try to include all the needed details while keeping them sanitized. \n Quick run down: I have a ipsec site to site vpn between two networks with 1Gb duplex connections through two pfsense 7000 series firewall appliances. Connection is stable however iperf only shows a bandwidth of 68 Mbps with transfer capping out at 8.50 MBytes from two hyper-v vm on either side of the tunnel. File transfers from local to remote site are also very slow at 20Mbps. While these speeds may work for my use case temporarily I can't help but feel I am missing something to speed this connection up.\n Steps I have taken to attempt to speed this up:\n Set MSS clamping to 1396 after calculating my OMSS. Sniffed before and after the changes and it fixed a fragmentation issue but speeds are unchanged. Using UDP over IPv4 for tunnel.\n Ensure there was no duplex mismatch on any NIC and no traffic shaping is in place.\n CPU's are mostly idle and a combined usage of less then 15%\n Asynchronous Cryptography is on, compression is off, no rules conflict with traffic.\n Any thoughts? I am at a loss and about to attempt another VPN option in the mean time to see if I can get better speeds elsewhere.\n    submitted by    /u/boringlichlight  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, when put in a real-world scenario of installing a virtual machine like Kali Linux, the time to install and configure is night and day when put side by side on my main laptop.

The other network is just the main computer that has connection to the internet and surveillance. Sometimes I would like to access the nas from the main computer to see how the backups are doing in the private network.

So far, so good.\n From the FTD to the switch I cannot reach anything.\n I cannot ping the vlan 1 IP address on the switch, even though I do get an ARP entry in the table, and the ping returns question marks, not dots. I had configured an IP address on the diagnostic interface in order to be able to reach a local DNS server from the FTD so I can use FQDN objects in some rules.\n I have checked ten locations and five of them work as expected (ping and DNS resolution) and five of them cannot reach the local IP addresses on the switch or DNS servers. \n This makes me feel like a noob. How can it be that I can ping from the switch to the FTD but not the other way round?\n    submitted by    /u/hstracker90  \n [link]   [comments]",

But which? 192.168.0.50 or 192.168.0.150?\n I have read different recommendations so far, from definitely inside, definitely outside to never mind.\n Sometimes I stumble over devices that don't even allow a reservation outside the pool.\n That's also why I've always defined reservations within the scope and only really fixed IPs outside of it.\n On the other hand, the pfSense Docs says:\n  \nISC dhcpd only checks via ping to ensure that an IP is not actively in use when making assignments.Making a static mapping does not “reserve” that IP out of the pool.The static mapping in this case merely represents a preference for an IP and others are not prevented from taking the IP if it is not in use. \n (...) \n As such, it is best to only make assignments outside the range/pool, and the GUI enforces this practice.\n  \nSo how it the right way to do it?\n Thanks and greetings,\n Martin\n    submitted by    /u/mfessl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So we are going through a network upgrade which includes all new devices, new ISP circuit, new servers, new fiber, etc. One thing that is new and we haven't dealt with before is implementing SPLUNK. SPLUNK will be used to log everything from clients, servers, network devices, and whatever else. It is currently setup and running, but not currently collecting anything from out network devices. \n For our syslog, we currently use Solar Winds Kiwi Syslog and that collects the data from all of our devices. My understanding with SPLUNK is that we set up a forwarder and the forwarder takes all the logs the Kiwi collects and forwards them to SPLUNK.\n Our department director is tired or waiting on the contractors to figure things out, so we he wants us to start configuring SPLUNK. He stated that he thinks SPLUNK has modules or packages you can setup that are made for Cisco devices which should make it easy to setup.\n What is the best way to go about setting this up? Is using a forwarder the right way to go about doing this? And if that's the case, do I still need to setup some type of module on SPLUNK for cisco devices? Or do I just forward the logs and analyze them that way? I was told to figure out what devices I need data collected from, but we already have kiwi collecting logs from all devices, so was thinking that those logs could just be forwarded as a whole. I didn't think I would have to install modules for each device that I want to collect date from. \n I have zero experience with splunk, so just looking to get pointed in the right direction.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Nats_daddy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I am in the process of configuring Cisco Umbrella DNS filtering and I noticed that, whilst it wasn't working particularly well on Chrome (only blocking the first request and allowing subsequent requests straight through), it was working perfectly on Firefox.\n After doing some digging, it appears that when Chrome detects the DNS servers in use support DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), it will automatically, unless specified by an admin policy, switch to using Secure DNS.\n With Secure DNS being served over HTTPS, this traffic no longer arrives at Umbrella on port 53 and appears to bypass DNS inspection completely.\n I have a case open with Cisco Umbrella on this one, but has anyone else come across this? Surely they haven't enabled DoH on their DNS servers and created a bypass for their own product?\n Edit: disabling Secure DNS via Group Policy for corporate users is definitely a possibility. I will have them routing via the (Secure Web Gateway) SWG so it would likely get caught there. I have intention of securing Guest WiFi users of which I have no control over their devices/browsers. This is my main concern.\n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/CoyKava  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have a network change/design opportunity and I am wanting to eliminate some route redistribution between OSPF and BGP. We use BGP for WAN routers to some of our sites around the state. We have remote connectivity from all around our state via our private fiber network, DMVPN tunnels (iWAN), and various peerings with Telco providers. We do this via 2 different data centers where we peer with different Telco routers via BGP, Cisco's iWAN, and our statewide aggregation routers that connect to our private fiber network across the state. The fiber network continues to grow as we lay more and more down each year. We bring those BGP routes into OSPF via route maps that have prefix lists attached to them. I wanted to go more into BGP and stop the route redistribution wherever I can. \n I am wondering if I should use BGP community values or route tags to allow our sites all around the state to determine what the best path to take would be. Basically every one of our remote locations have several methods of communication back to the data centers. I would like to make one path look better, and fail over, or be able to easily switch paths by changing a route map somewhere centrally to our data center. So if I change a value of a community string or route tag, all the sites switch paths at the same time, should I decide that needs to happen. Am I going down the right path here?

Or, perhaps it is such a dumb idea that it does not exist online. \n I want to segment my network. Simple enough. My idea was to use firewalls at the edge of each network segment (\"star\" topology central router leads to firewalls at each outgoing port for the various departments) for high security. \n Is this... Reasonable? I only seem to find network segmenting that simply uses switches, but with no firewall other than that which leads to the WAN or DMZ. Additionally, how would these firewalls generally be configured? I would imagine I could allow only the ports that are reasonable for that segment's network usage?\n Also, can I use application proxy gateways at the edge of network segments? Online sources imply that proxies should only be used at the outside edge of the LAN. I want one proxy for one department, but a different proxy for another. Each then accessing the central router of the star topology. \n TL;DR can firewalls be reasonably used as a security measure for multiple internal network segments?

In a blog post the creator, when talking about how croc works, explains:\n  \nThere are better ways than sequentially uploading and downloading. Instead, you can use a relay server to create a full-duplex real-time communication layer between the two computers so that “uploading” and “downloading” occur simultaneously between the two computers.\n  \nWhich in context sounds a lot like NAT hole punching. Is this just a misuse of the term stapling or is stapling something completely different / nonsense? Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Apocryphenn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now things are running slow in one of the departments. We planned to run a new cat6 cable (100m) directly to the main switch. Is it worth it?

It has several nics but only one active (not disabled). The server isn't set up with any virtualization. The issue is that the switch is showing 2 Mac addresses coming in on the same port that the server is attached to, arp shows another IP address , associated with a Mac address that is sequentially 1 higher (last digit) than the configured nic on the server, it also has an IP address in the same subnet as the one configured on the server so it would appear as though it would possibly be a secondary port on the nic. The server responds to pings on this secondary IP, nmap scans show only udp 68 being open on this IP. Here is the weird part, the machine doesn't show the IP being configured anywhere, ipconfig doesn't even list the Mac nor the IP of this secondary IP. Running Wireshark while pinging the secondary IP shows what you would expect from a configured nic, except it isn't configured anywhere that I can find...any suggestions on locating where this is coming from would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/judgethisyounutball  \n [link]   [comments]",
