I reached out to the security company's helpdesk and they suggested nic teaming 2 of the nics to increase bandwidth. So I added nic 1 and nic 2 to a team along with the settings the help desk suggested. As it's adding the nics, it immediately errors out and states Faulted, not found on both nics, then the redundant nics 3 and 4 drop their connections. When I realized that the security camera server had no network, I immediately called a senior analyst over, and then the server became unresponsive. Since it was unresponsive, we rebooted it. It stayed on the \"restarting\" screen for apx 5 minutes and then blue-screened. Also, before it became unresponsive, I attempted a windows troubleshoot, and it gave me a \"drivers\" error.

Doing all of the admin alongside to make sure there is no data leak. \n Then the business describes this year the same old thing we have no budget to invest in new systems, hardware, infrastructure or give bonuses due to the economic world. \n We work incredibly hard all of us to keep the business running in a stable robust environment to prevent from breaches and other unknowns. I can say that and other IT admins will hopefully respect that. \n Yet it just feels when you see a leaver asking you about the process of keeping my IT business assets when I leave it's like do we owe you that. It's not yours. It's the businesses. Yes you have a phone number that's the businesses line number. Your iPhone the one that says property of XYZ.com is again a business asset. Also the laptop which is a corp laptop with a corp image on it with corp licensing on it is not yours they still seem to think it's ok to ask for this when they leave like it's a sentimental thing ? \n Then it comes your manager asks you to make sure they transition you off everything and give them the guidance you should of done this and that. In work hours when you have other actual jobs work related jobs to be doing. \n Why do businesses not stand up and have a stern stance on this. They have a HR team they have policies and procedures and we chase users for not bringing kit back and holding final salary payment but the odd who dosent want to let go demands they want IT hardware as a parting gift.

          "description": "I'll share as much detail as possible as this problem hasn't waivered. Keep in mind this is my first step up from IT specialist to sys admin so bear with me OGs.\n We are operating on a 2016 Windows Server and this holds all of our drives. The business is about 100 people. In November, I installed the .NET Framework 4.8(KB5020614) and the Update for Windows Server 2016(KB5019964). I have had non-stop issues with connectivity to the drives ever since. The errors string from \"local device name is already in use,\" to \"Target name is incorrect.\"\n I have found limited success in doing ipconfig/release-renew-flushdns. It's usually a 50-50 chance that the issue resolves after that. If I use the IP address to the server in the file explorer address bar, it immediately pulls up; its the complete opposite when I try to call it by its name \\\\server1\\. I've checked the DNS and DHCP to see if they're properly communicating and there seems to be nothing wrong(not ruling them out).\n As recent as yesterday, I have started to force our user computers to use a different IP through the IPv4 in adapter options. For instance, I'll make 192.168.8.113 go to 192.168.8.204. I have found complete success with this and the most odd part is I can set the user machine back to automatically grabbing an IP address which will revert it to 192.168.8.113 and it instantly works. \n It seems like I'm forcing the previous session to end and renewing the lease on the DHCP ??? I don't know but I'm open to all suggestions as my boss(the owner) grows in irritation. \n Thanks ahead of time.\n    submitted by    /u/Zelliion  \n [link]   [comments]",

This has now gone from a request for help to a quest of understanding.\n So a while ago I was doing some fiddling with a client Synology, had created a new backup folder, unmapped the old one, attempted to remap the new one. \"Invalid Password\". Ok sure, that happens sometimes, thing is I didn't actually need the drive to be mapped as the backup software (backup assist) could see the location and access it with the given details so I figured it'd be fine. Decided to fix mapping the drive after the next scheduled reboot.\n Everything was not fine, turns out that despite being able to see and access the NAS, when attempting to actually perform the backup task it would fail as \"unable to access the network location\". Keep in mind, all I have done is make a new 2023 subfolder in the backup folder (we're MSP, they like it that way) and try to map it back after removing the 2022 folder.\n So I make a new user, try to map it with that, nope, same thing. Despite being able to log into the device with these same creds that Windows doesn't like.\n After that I restart things, bash my head against the wall a bit, find some other people who had similar problems that came about as the result of a setting change (none of mine have, double and triple checked), so I come here, begin writing my post, and mid way through I decide to try to map it one more time.\n It fucking works.\n And I haven't even done anything.

We get emails to a specific shared mailbox for the backups, so the process of recording the backups is to check the folder for a given client, tick if the expected backup succeeded, go on to the next (and of course if there isn't a tick, investigate why).\n Problem being that it's pretty slow to load several thousand tickboxes and as soon as we create a new backup/new customer it completely drags it down.

We are a fairly small company and to be honest, haven't had to fire any once since we have been full remote. I still need to work out the details with HR, but I got the impression this will be over a teams call. Our business works with a lot of customer data that this individual has access to, and want to cut that access almost instantly after the call. Here is a bit about our environment:\n User has a laptop that is Intune enrolled. We have our DCs in Azure and use a lot of the typical MS services such as teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc.. This particular user has some of our customer files SharePoint doc libraries synced with OneDrive to his local machine.\n If while we are on the call, his password is changed, SharePoint and files access removed, doesnt this take some time to sync? I believe the last time I removed some ones Azure files access, they had it for several more hours. Is this the same for Sharepoint? We do have \"Automate\" installed on his machine, so I could force a reboot, but if he is not on the VPN at the time, the password might not sync and still be cached. I did some research and saw there is a registry item that can be changed.\n Although I could wipe the machine with Intune, I do want to be able to go through the machine and make sure he does not have local files that need moved to a project directory on the network. \n Will a password change instantly cut his access on his phone as well, or do I need to revoke those tokens as well?\n I would appreciate any suggestions to make this as streamlined as possible, its not something we are particularly excited about having to do, but they are leaving us no choice.\n    submitted by    /u/eld101  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So this may be a stupid question and maybe I'm reading too much into it, but here's where I'm unsure:\n I deal with Cybersecurity Insurance Questionnaires for our clients. A lot of times it'll ask if server databases are encrypted at-rest, and from my understanding and from what tools we use, this is basically asking \"Is Bitlocker enabled on server data disks?\" and the answer is typically No.\n However now I have this question for a client who's servers are all Azure VMs. These do not have Azure Disk Encryption enabled, which from my (potentially limited) understanding, means Bitlocker is not enabled on the virtual disk. However, Azure VMs by default live on Microsoft's data centers, and the physical disks in those data centers have server-side encryption (SSE) \n So my question is... does this count for at-rest encryption as far as this cybersecurity questionnaire is concerned? Because from my (again, probably limited) understanding, at-rest encryption is intended to protect against someone getting access to the physical disk, and sure this would prevent it if someone broke into the Microsoft data center and somehow stole the disk this VM lived on so that would seem to make the answer to the question \"Yes\" in the most technical sense. But if someone gained access to the Azure environment & stole the VHD file, then Bitlocker isn't enabled on that file and could presumably read all the contents then it's like... was at-rest encryption really even on? Is at-rest encryption explicitly a protection against physical data breaches? Or should at-rest encryption include VM disk encryption when the server in question is a VM?\n Or maybe I'm thinking too hard about this?\n    submitted by    /u/The0  \n [link]   [comments]",

The remote connection cannot be started.\"\n Interestingly, some users still worked fine however, and these were users sat next to each other in the same office.\n Now, we've seen issues where the signature can throw off the RDP file sometimes so we edited the file in notepad and removed both the \"signscope:s:\" and \"signature:s:\" values, this allowed it to work, obviously this bypasses the whole \"digitally signed\" part of the file.\n We checked the usual before this, ensuring all the certificates were valid etc. (they were) and no weird updates had been applied to clients or the relevant servers (they hadn't) so we deployed this file to affected users.\n However, we then got a report from another customer with the same issue, then a third reported the issue. Our initial thought being some sort of CA issue, but two of these customers used Sectigo, the other was R5/GlobalSign so that ruled that idea out.\n We couldn't find a reason for this so eventually just had to remove those two lines from the files and it seemed to resolve the issue. A cursory glance around the Internet only really flagged this issue when using self signed certs, we aren't.\n Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! At the moment we have only seen this at 3 (maybe 4) customers but obviously don't want to see this get more widespread!\n As an additional point, the RDP file \"breaks\" regardless of where it's used from, so it doesn't look to be the originating network that's the issue.\n    submitted by    /u/Delodien  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n Are there any guides for how to administer FIDO physical security keys like Yubikeys for an entire team/organization?\n The biggest hurdle I would expect to see is a user losing their key. I don't understand how organizations which require all users have physical keys handle this on an administrative level, and I am struggling to find any real world examples/best practice documentation on it. \n I understand for any account fully controlled by your organization (such as Microsoft 365) that a lost key can be handled from an administrative portal. But how do you handle a lost or broken key on accounts that you do not have full administrative control over, such as a social media account? If you require your staff to register a backup key, does that not create other issues (my knee-jerk reaction is end users would end up carrying the backup with them so they can always have it to register both at once, or would forget to bring in the backup key so it never gets registered, both of which defeats the purpose of the backup key) or do you require that the IT department register additional keys on MFA setup?\n Am I overlooking something obvious, or is this just something that sysadmins just deal with? It would seem to me that the best way of solving this would be if a YubiKey/similar product could be \"paired\" so that one key could register both itself and a cold backup key that is stored elsewhere (held by IT in a corporate use case) without having to carry both.\n Thank you for any insight,\n    submitted by    /u/Party-Cook-1666  \n [link]   [comments]",

Outlook 365 (NEWEST VERSION) after about 4 hours becomes unresponsive and when restarting the application it will get stuck on LOADING PROFILE. Like all good sysadmins I did my google searching forever on this and there is not one thing (rebuild profile, reinstall Office, repair OST, rebuild OST, turn off bad add-ins that do nothing but slow you down, reset the navpane, everything) that hasn't worked. The ONLY thing that works is once it gets into that state, a quick reboot fixes it for another 4 hours. I keep saying 4 hours because it's been close to clockwork when it happens 4-5 hours later.\n Talk about an annoying piece of crap. We all can have our rants on crappy MSFT software updates and programming. However, I have had a few other users with the new version of Outlook with similar issues, but the beforementioned methods have worked (but it eats up precious time none of us have). The difference with my users is they are all Windows 10, and I was the idiot that was smart enough to upgrade to Windows 11.\n Any thoughts? Other than the IT guy is an idiot (I hate that I can't even figure out my own stupid issue)? Sure, I can drag MSFT into it (and probably will if I can't get it figured out) but I thought I would turn to the much smarter guys first.\n Edit 1: Outlook will still hang even with an attempt to load in Safe Mode...\n Edit 2: I have deleted fully all OST's and rebuilt from the server twice now, not that either.. \n    submitted by    /u/CrazyITMan  \n [link]   [comments]",

I work under an IT director and we're just a 2 man department.\n My boss is a total workaholic and it's hard to get him to delegate stuff to me, so I feel like working with him is a competition in my own head to try to jump on top of any work to be done because if I don't do the work within 5 minutes of it coming up, he just does it.\n Because the org isn't terribly large, we end up running out of work to do pretty quickly, and I start to get a little nervous that I'm not doing enough, or that I might get laid off or something if I don't continue to prove my worth to the org.\n The org I work for is actually awesome. I know a common perspective people have is to do the bare minimum and collect a paycheck because \"coporate overlord dont care about you, employee,\" but this org has been amazing to everyone with very generous compensation, org-wide raises that consist with inflation and THEN some, great benefits, and an overall healthy and productive environment/community of people.\n So, I really want to be doing more and being more useful because I feel like i just don't do anything all day and it's eating away at my soul every night lmao.\n anyone got any good suggestions? how do you keep growing when there isn't a fire under your ass?\n    submitted by    /u/TiredOfGods  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did some more monitoring and saw that the cpu queue is sometimes a bit to high (about 5 - 10 for a 16 core VM).\n So i like to spread the user over more servers and read about the sizing guide from microsoft. Our users working with the office programs, ERP System and doing normal surfing and research via MS Edge and Google Chrome. Due to this workload i would say that its categorized in the heavy work load / power users.\n For that Microsoft says i should use 4 vCPU and about 8 GB RAM per User. Thats beeing said for our about 140 User, i shoud have about 144 vCPUs and 1 TB RAM. Thats seems quite high for me. Usally i dont provision 1:1 CPU ratio. \n Microsoft also say, i should not provision more then 2 users per vCPU. Thats still 72 vCPUs for all. Due to the workload i dont get a good ratio about real threats and vCPU (on Hyper-V). \n I'm quite curios about other RDS farms with about the same workload. I read some threats on the internet where 20 Users are on a quad core system with 16 GB RAM. Other wrote that they have 8 Core, 32 GB RAM but just provision it to 4 users. Its quite hard to see the real workload on other infrastructures. \n So, could some people tell about their sizing in situation there the users doing a simiar workload?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/teqqyde  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So we have this guy that works... \"works\"... with us and we've noticed an increase in the frequency that we see Netflix up on his computer, through his browser. Now, we don't have a problem with someone pulling up Netflix while they work for background noise, if it helps them get the work done more efficiently, I myself have YouTube videos up while I'm working, it helps me concentrate and get my work done, and my boss doesn't have a problem with it. The major issue is that this guy doesn't really do anything, just sits on Yahoo! all day and watches Netflix. So we were thinking, we should block Netflix on his computer. The only problem is, Netflix has thousands of IP addresses, and trying to block, or redirect, based on IP would take a long time, time that we don't really have.\n So my question is this... does anyone know of an effective way to block Netflix on a domain computer, and only that domain computer? Blocking the site on the network completely is not an option, based on the nature of our work environment, so we need it to be just for one computer. We also do not want him to know that we actively blocked it, he has a bad temper and flies off the handle when things like this are brought up, and retaliation is a real fear, so a redirect to localhost is preferred. If it's not possible, I get it, but we need him to not be on Netflix all day.\n NOTE: 1.) My boss can't fire him, he's been trying. 2.) He's tried talking to him about things like this before, it doesn't work. 3.) HR has been ineffective at helping the situation, their advice as \"All you can do is talk to him.\"\n    submitted by    /u/RicketyGaming  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was a storm overnight that turned the power off for a while and when everyone came in this morning computers turned on like normal except the \"server\" (Win10 machine with all shared files on it). Basically the machine would not boot windows. Plugged the SSD into another computer and saw the data was RAW instead of NTFS. I have to format the drive in order to use the SSD again. They had 2 external drives plugged into the computer for backing up but apparently the last time anything was done on the drives was back in 2020 and there weren't even any backups. Is there anyway to recover the SSD without formatting or is it a total loss? The company does not have IT, they call us whenever there's an issue and we offered to do cloud backups a while back but they're cheap and refused saying they'd do it on their own.\n Update: the computer was windows 10 but they were running server 2019 on Hyper V.

In my free time, I like to play games, mostly Dota 2, warzone.\n So I started to look for a laptop, for office work. I found out that if I dont want the lowest tier office laptop, I am gonna pay around 700-800 ‚Ç¨ (which is my budget). For this price, I can find some lower tier gaming laptops (10- 11th gen intel, rtx 3050, 144 Hz displays which I find very comfortable to work with). \n Thats where my dilemma starts, would you rather buy a mid tier office laptop, but not have the ability to use it for entertainment, or aim for lower tier gaming laptop which may have some disadvatages ( overheating, weight, noise)? \n My best options I found on the web so far:\n Office laptops: DELL Latitude 15-3520, ASUS Vivobook 15X OLED X1503ZA-MA437W,\n Gaming laptops: MSI GF63 Thin 11SC, Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15IHU6 Shadow Black \n All of these are approximately 800‚Ç¨ (you can suggest different). Besides that, I am have a desktop PC at home, mid tier gaming machine, but sometimes I work from outside my home. I dont have any laptop right now.\n Thank you your replies, I appreciate all of the advices and shared experiences.\n    submitted by    /u/marosko93  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We had a major power event at our main data center yesterday. Maintenance was being performed on our UPS, something went wrong and we lost all power to all of the racks including our production Nutanix cluster (5 hosts, ~120 running VMs) and our main backup repository (Dell Data Domain). I was shocked when we powered everything back up and there wasn't a single data corruption issue (that we have found). In hindsight, I know I should have shut everything down gracefully ahead of time but they assurred me it was routine thing that they do all the time and it wouldn't cause any issues. That should have been the red flag.\n The point of my story is....we've come a long way in recent years in terms of preventing data corruption. I remember a time when pulling the power on a SQL Server while running would almost certainly mean recovering databases from a backup.

While it does install the app (if its in the same directory as the script for now), it does not create the key.\n $software = \"MakeMeAdmin 2.3.0 x64.msi\" $msiPath = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot $software if (Test-Path $msiPath) { Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList \"/i `\"$msiPath`\" /quiet /passive\" if (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ProductFilter -Filter \"Name='$software'\") { Write-Output \"'$software' is installed.\" # Create the MakeMeAdmin key if it does not exist if (!(Test-Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\MakeMeAdmin\")) { New-Item -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\\" -Name \"MakeMeAdmin\" -Force | Out-Null } # Set the AdminRightTimeout value to 60 minutes New-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\MakeMeAdmin\" -Name \"AdminRightTimeout\" -Value \"60\" -PropertyType DWORD -Force } else { Write-Output \"'$software' NOT installed.\" } } else { Write-Output \"MSI package '$software' not found.\" } \n Sorry if the post sounds confusing, I am lost myself rn haha\n    submitted by    /u/Unkn0wn-G0d  \n [link]   [comments]",

I work for, they are largely a windows shop and while they have been generous to provide admin rights on developer machine. Basically their development process is very manual and limited automation.\n So trying to get automation in is rather challenging due to the firewall. EG: I cannot use terraform as trying to use it from the terminal fails due to the proxy settings. Similar for minikube or pulling from the docker hub. In December there was some screw up because I could actually pull docker containers from hub.docker.com. When speaking to the infosec people they keep telling me we need static IP's so that they can allow those sites. However trying to find out who can assign static IP's just results in the run around. \n Surely there is a way with windows group policies to allow developers in that policy to get access to terraform/npm/docker?\n I think the firewall solution is from fortinet if that helps with suggestions.\n ‚Äã\n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Majestic-Extension94  \n [link]   [comments]",

This site was quite helpful, but I discovered that I had a hard time coming up with fake users, fake documents, and the like to make it actually look like an internal company network that was in use.\n Whilst doing this, I thought to ask ChatGPT for some help on the matter, and the results were quite helpful. I gave the prompt:\n  \nI'm trying to learn how to become a sys-admin, in order to do this I'm creating a homelab in VMware, I want this homelab to be a realistic simulation of an SMB, please generate some fake, but reasonable information about this fictional SMB that I'm emulating for training purposes. \n  \nIt gave me some excellent data that would likely take me forever to think of on my own. It included names of employees, their good/bad passwords, company details like location and size, it even gave me data about the technology they used!\n I've seen people use ChatGPT for writing scripts or fixing problems, but with dubious accuracy. Alot of the solutions are good, but it seems about half of them contain some manner of issues and inaccuracies. However, it seems that ChatGPT's excellence in making up BS can actually be used for good!\n EDIT: Let it be known that ChatGPT's accuracy is sometimes a bit better than half, but in all fairness I wouldn't trust it enough to justify some peoples uses for it. Although generating reasonable, but fake information seems to have a 100% chance of working.\n    submitted by    /u/Technobyte141  \n [link]   [comments]",

We were running on shoestring budgets and poor leadership. We were expected to move mountains and were in constant fire fighter mode. \n The new organization is much more mature and more resourced. The IT team appears to be at least 10 times the size of the previous company. Everything is organized, automated and cutting edge. There are clear expectations and IT appears to be highly regarded by the leadership team. \n My initial reaction was feeling like there is nothing for me to do at the new company since there aren't any burning fires to put out but I realized that this new environment and change in culture offers me time to actually grow. I can actually focus and learn new things rather than run from one problem to another. \n Just wondering how others have gone through this experience.

          "description": "So recently I was asking a question about how to fix Grub if I'm installing Windows after Ubuntu. I found the solution. But now I want to ask about aftermaths of boot-repair. So, my system was working like this before:\n  \nUbuntu with Grub\n Windows on hdd\n  \nSo what I did is I unplugged every drive, I installed Windows on new m2 ssd, connected old hdd (where my old windows was located), transfered all data and formatted hdd so it's now just a storage for windows. Then I connected ssd with my ubuntu and run boot-repair from my usb flash. After that grub got fixed and I can choose between new Windows and Ubuntu, and it's all working.\n But one thing that bothers me is that there's still old Windows left on grub menu, even tho I formatted old hdd with Windows. Also in UEFI there were added more options to boot from, like ubuntu (m2 ssd) and ubuntu (hdd) even tho ubuntu is not installed there at all. I have the logs from boot-repair saved, if they're safe to share, I can share them. Also I can screenshot my partitions if it's needed, just tell me what to run, I'm not a pro in such things, and it seems like no-one in other communties can help me (I asked this question many times), so please don't delete the question, because last time I asked here something, it got deleted even tho it didn't violate any rules, but I was lucky enough to get the answer before it got deleted, so I came here again, as my last hope, not trying to violate anything.\n My question is, should I be worried about something? Or it's not of a big deal and I can forget about it? It also says when I'm booting to Ubuntu \"failed to set APST feature\" and something starts going on, and eventually it loads after a little time and works fine, new Windows on m2 ssd works fine too.\n    submitted by    /u/Zakepanka  \n [link]   [comments]",

While designing and implementing systems is fun, the detective work appeals to my inner curiosity.\n Much of my research around getting started in this field suggests learning an OS in-and-out, a close-second is learning a scripting language. Because I work in a Windows environment, it's sensible to start with Windows and PowerShell. This makes sense, but I don't know how to go about tackling the former. \n There are some books, like Powershell for SysAdmins, that can teach me Windows administration through PowerShell--hitting two birds with one stone.

Currently they have licenses in all 3 and open 3 separate mailboxes in Outlook with various forwarding rules etc set up.\n Ideally it would be much simpler for them to manage with one account and mailbox and just use aliases from the other tenants but I haven‚Äôt been able to find any good docs on how to do that or if it‚Äôs even possible. Tenants have to stay as separate entities due to the way the companies are silo‚Äôd. \n Looking for recommendations on how to do this simpler/better!

Also took care of other stuff and was testing out Intune for consistent MDM deployment.\n Boss was also global admin himself and fucks around with permissions and settings, causing problems that I don't understand because he doesn't tell me what he changed.\n He also has this minion dude that works a couple hours a week and barely knows how to install a computer.\n So yesterday I get called in and get this 3 page letter stating that I'm doing everything wrong, got my priorities wrong, I meddle in things that I should not meddle in, I'm watching Netflix at work on my laptop, which is a complete lie, and I'm not following orders. I'm not 21, I'm 52 with a ton of experience who's jaw dropped when he said that he didn't need any backups.\n So at the end of the talk, he says he withdraws my admin rights. So now I can't do anything. \"Sure you can, just pick out the roles that you need\".

For the migration, we are using BitTitan.\n In Office 365, I set up the public folder and using BitTitan, migrated the stuff over.

You need to load it up, open a hive etc. Is there an easy way to accomplish this over command line so it can be automated?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/moneydontjiggle4sure  \n [link]   [comments]",

But once none of their recommendations worked, they said \"Unfortunately your product version is no longer supported.\"\n I replied saying that can't possibly be true, as you all are still actively selling the product. So they backtrack and ask, \"May I know proof of purchase?\" To which I responded that we no longer have the receipt. But sent them the activation key, the email used to originally purchase the software, and a screenshot logged into said account on our registered products page.\n From here, they send, \"Another user may be able to help you get an answer in one of the forums\" to which they provide a link that just goes to their parent company's main page with no forums mentioned anywhere.\n So I inform them of this... and the response? \"May I know proof of purchase\" - same exact guy I have been speaking to this whole time. \n I open a second ticket in an attempt to get a different technician. Specifically ask not to get \"Mr. XYZ\" and I end up back with him anyways. We have the exact same conversation mentioned above and this is a never ending loop.

Could you please call IT support?\"\n And the Prof.: \"Sure no problemo, let's call them and wait a fucking eternity until they come in and fix this damn beamer. Back in the old days we used overhead Projectors were it was impossible to paste the notes on the wall, because who would be so stupid to print them on the same piece of foil as the presentation. The good old times, am I right?\"\n I myself am only working ~6 years in IT (3 years apprenticeship[Ausbildung in Germany], 3 years hands on). But I notice with a lot of new graduate IT colleagues comming from university, their basic skills are just non existent.\n A friend of mine seriously tried to buy network HUBs in his company, because he learned in university that those can transmit data way faster because of the lack of overhead.

Things have evolved a little and I am certain the lockouts are coming from Exchange, but I have looked through every Exchange/IIS log I can find and I am unable to find corresponding attempts to access these users' mailboxes. \n I finally enlisted Microsoft Support after reaching my wits end with this issue and dropped the $500 on a ticket. After a day and a half of intermittently working with them to investigate the issue, they came to the conclusion that...the Exchange server was the source of the lockouts...\n They admitted that I knew that when I submitted the ticket, so they told me they were going to refund the cost of the ticket, but we need to reach out to premier support for a RCA (root cause analysis) as they had reached their limitations in assisting us (they didn't even get as far along as I did in my own investigating...). \n So I reached out to premier support. Where I'm told you need a premier support contract to get support from them. That contract, I am told, starts at $53,000. $53,000 is what it would cost us to get support from Microsoft, on a Microsoft product, that we already pay heavily for for the \"privilege\" of using...\n Does this align with anybody else's experience? Are there any other options for us that don't involve spending $53,000?

So we currently have a guy who holds numerous hats in our IT department (sys admin, network admin, security admin and more) my thing is he is trying to gate keep a lot of roles and does not want anyone else (new sys admin, and service desk guys) to have access to certain things like AD, servers, network monitoring tools etc. He‚Äôs been here longer than our manager so I believe he makes alot of his own decisions based off his ease of use and comfort which imo should not be the case especially if he is implementing security processes. I feel there would be a lack of true security if it is mainly just benefiting him rather than the company. With that being said I believe we should hire a IT security guy to audit/ work with us but work on a different team.

I was acutally shaking so much you could hear the paper move LMAO, but I explained in detail how a certain boss treated me, including how he asked me to break the law to get something he wanted (I had email evidence), and how much it stressed me out when he would be angry that i didn't follow through. I also explained how this workload was too much for one person to carry, and the person I spoke with took me seriously, and I was put on sick leave with pay until I can see a doctor. They're launching an investigation into that boss starting from the very top, and addressing the rotten workplace culture in a discrete manner.\n I have a doctor's appointment on Monday, and I'll most likely get a mental health sick note to take some time off.

Some said Yes by confining the scope of the analysis to the drives.\n Others pointed out that a single RAID controller or power supply failure would defeat the HA nature of the RAID drives.\n Wikipedia states:\n There are three principles of systems design in reliability engineering which can help achieve high availability.\n Elimination of single points of failure. This means adding or building redundancy into the system so that failure of a component does not mean failure of the entire system. Reliable crossover. In redundant systems, the crossover point itself tends to become a single point of failure. Reliable systems must provide for reliable crossover. Detection of failures as they occur. If the two principles above are observed, then a user may never see a failure ‚Äì but the maintenance activity must. ....\n It strikes me that there is an important distinction between having some redundant components and having no single point of failure.\n I can see that RAID alone has good capacity to improve availability, but I wouldn‚Äôt say RAID is HA.

Currently all RDSH Servers are VMs Virtualized using Hyper-V as the Hypervisor.\n By the looks of it I need a Enterprise NVidia GPU that is compatible with the Server (Dell PowerEdge R640 for example can support an NVIDIA T4 GPU).\n However reading online, Microsoft have removed vGPU / RemoteFX Support from Windows Server 2016 Build 1084. So this is a no go.\n I think I need the following:\n > An Enterprise Driver License from NVidia\n > A physical GPU installed in a Server, for example the NVIDIA T4\n > A Hypervisor that supports vGPU\n Looking on the NVidia Website, it looks like this is only supported using the following Hypervisors:\n > VMWare vSphere\n > Citrix Hypervisor 8.4\n Both of the above Hypervisors are incredibly expensive in terms of licensing. If I use what I currently have (Hyper-V - Server 2019) this would not allow vGPU or Remote FX, but would only allow physical mapping, so 1 x Physical GPU directly mapped using DDA to the Guest VM RDSH.\n Am I missing something here, how are other enterprises adding Shared vGPUs to their Virtualised RDSH VMs to improve performance?

          "description": "I recently left a Glassdoor review for a company I interviewed with, but didn't end up getting the job. I wanted to alert other candidates about the red flags I found during the hiring process. However, the company somehow managed to trace the review back to me, and I have no idea how they did it.\n To be honest, I'm not even scared or intimidated that they found out it was me behind the review. I've been job searching since I got laid off, and I don't care about burning bridges at this point. Companies already burn bridges with their bad treatment and terrible hiring processes, treating employees and job candidates as disposable assets.\n The hiring manager even sent me an email to schedule a call with him to clarify some of the points I made in my review and to see if there's a job opportunity for me. But I've been burned by corporate so many times that I have serious trust issues with companies. At this point in my life, I don't believe anything that comes from them, especially if they start dangling carrots in front of me.\n I admit, I'm curious to know how they traced the review back to me, but I'm not willing to risk my privacy to find out. I also want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with Glassdoor reviews being traced back to them. What are your thoughts on this situation? Should I take the call from the hiring manager, or is it not worth my time?\n I'm open to any honest feedback and opinions.

What I'm looking to better understand is at what point does administration become engineering. Based on my experience the line is thin and dependent on the organization that you work for. The way I've reasoned this out in my head in the past is that administration is mainly monitoring/maintaining while engineering tends to be more focused on the planning/creation/building of infrastructure.\n It appears that a lot of employers tend to blur these lines. Though it could just be skewed perspective based on my experience. I'd like to have some idea of where this line is so that I can better educate and prepare myself when negotiating with my current employer and/or other potential employers.\n    submitted by    /u/RickAmbramotte  \n [link]   [comments]",

I recently moved to Miami and got picked up by a very top shelf corporate company. It's one of the most sought out due to their benefits and I've heard other techs had to apply 17 times to get their jobs so I assumed I would be surrounded by the top of the top. Instead, it's been 4 months and I can confirm I'm surrounded by some of the laziest inept workers I have ever seen. No one wants to work, tickets are constantly needing to be reopened, users always complaining. Some techs even get written up several times a month but have still been with the company for 4 years because \"they never fire\".\n This is my first venture into Corporate IT for a large company of around 20,000 employees but I already feel like 80% of the IT department are milking checks. Is this the same across the majority of big companies like this? Should I bother staying with them if i spend more time patching up others mistakes rather than learning something new? I will admit that there are definetly career oppurtunies as most people working in IT support here are so bad my manager has considered making me a IT Tech Tier III Lead but my past jobs would have pinned me as Tier 1.5-2 in skill (fake it till you make it lol)\n    submitted by    /u/SignificantAd5680  \n [link]   [comments]",

(pgpwde --add-bypass --disk 0 --count 6 --aa)\n Copies SED reflect drivers to needed folder for use during upgrade\n Create variable OSDSetupAdditionalUpgradeOptions to include the above reflect drivers\n Upgrade to newer version of Windows 10\n Restart computer\n Re-register the SED password filter\n Disable SED bypass (pgpwde --remove-bypass --aa)\n Reboot\n Decrypt SED encrypted drive (pgpwde --decrypt --disk 0 --aa --all)\n Uninstall SED\n The sequence goes on, but the above is the pertinent bits.\n  \nThe issue I'm having is that the \"pgpwde --remove-bypass -aa\" command is failing after the upgrade.\n The error I'm getting is -11977 Improper Initialization, which I can only find one reference when Googling, which is: https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=f100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427&CommunityKey=8deae12f-88a6-4d88-9186-231c4ca171d7&tab=digestviewer#bmf100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427\n Which references Linux.\n The removal of the bypass only fails before a user logs in. Once a user has logged onto the machine, and back off again, then the bypass can be removed.\n So, my thought process is that, perhaps, SED isn't sully started when Windows starts, resulting in a weird state where the commands won't run until SED finishes starting, but I'm not sure SED's underlying mechanics enough to remediate this.\n It's also an older version of SED, like 10.4 or something.\n    submitted by    /u/Nakatomi2010  \n [link]   [comments]",

Are these unique experiences I've had, or is it true for everyone?\n I am definitely on the younger side of this sysadmin thing, in my mid 20s. I do not have as much experience as some of you folks but am definitely qualified for the roles I've been interviewed for and while I'm not the best interviewee in the world, I feel I'm decent enough.\n I'm just starting my third tech/sysadmin role. I've probably had 6 or 7 interviews that have gotten to or near the final stage in this field between all of these roles. For every role I have ended up getting, my direct manager has been quite young for someone in their position, somewhere in their 20s for all of them. These aren't even interviews that I feel I've done particularly well in. In fact, I feel some of them were quite bad, worse than ones I have failed.\n However, I notice the opposite with deciders who are a generation or two older than me. Many of them more than double my age. In these interviews, I have come out feeling like I nailed every question and left no room for questioning, but still find out they have chosen the other candidate or did not choose me for hire. From my personal experiences it just seems so blatant and honestly the largest factor in the interview process.

My understanding, then, is that basically the only way to open a 1Password encrypted vault is to be on a device that has already been authorized and have your user password. \n So what's to stop an attacker from using a keylogger to get your user password, and then gaining remote control of your device and just logging into it?

Even though im still always doing things.\n I was curious as to if anyone else here has ever done such a good job at a company, that the company felt they were no longer needed because everything always works and there are very few pr minor issues happening?\n I also ask because when i first started my job here, there were fires to put out every day. The question every day was \"what are we fixing today\". And according to staff, this was the norm for many years. They havent had their systems consistantly work for years. \n Over the course of the past 2 years ive been here, i have fixed many problems and was able to make it so people are no longer asking \"what is going to break today\", and they can confidently do their job. However, i have found that i am not doing as much work as i used to now. Half of the day is making sure everything is still working fine, or coming up with new ideas/projects to work on for improvements, and the other half of the day is just studying and researching because there really isnt too much else that i can do. And this is unfortunate because all of that work and research nobody can trace or see that i am doing it, they can only assume. Or for the worse, assume im not doing it.\n I realized that, to the everyday staff worker, i went from always walking around helping people and always being seen, to basically being a hermit who never has to leave his office. I dont think that they will let me go because they do love what i have done, but the anxiety side of me worries that if they dont see me actively doing something, they will think im not doing anything, and given nothing is breaking to fix, im no longer needed.\n    submitted by    /u/CleverKrunk  \n [link]   [comments]",

This applies to both the dev/sysadmin sides of IT.\n I've only had 1 IT head who was technical and had great soft skills, he we an amazing boss, we could discuss technical details at length, and he knew how to carry himself and represent us in C level meetings, he was amazing. \n Why is it that only IT has this issue? Our CFO knows all about the ins and outs of budgets/cashflow and is very knowledge in his field. Our Head of HR knows all about policies etc. Our C level exec of law is VERY knowledge in law.\n Its not just past jobs either, you wouldnt hire a head of medical surgery that had no idea how to perform any surgery. You wouldnt hire head chef who couldnt cook. Imagine hiring a head of Marketing or Sales who had little to no idea about marketing or sales.\n I'm not saying you need to be hyper technical about IT to be a CIO, but you at least have to be good at it in some capacity in ADDITION to have good soft, management and leadership skills (just like any other C level position). I'm not advocating hiring a technical person who has crap soft skills btw. \n Is it just that finding someone who is technical and has the above skills is to hard to find in IT? So they just hire non technical people to run IT departments because thats all their is in the talent pool?\n    submitted by    /u/ThatAJC88  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello altogether,\n I'd like to tell you something about task on going and I am stuck therefore I am searching for new creative ideas in this topic.\n --\n Background story: We currently use Office 2016 for Blue collar workers where they use shared-devices in order to edit documents, review or save them. Basically what a white collar does just with a M365 E3 License. However Microsoft has announced that Office 2016 and below is ending support for M365 Connectivity services - that's where the problem begins.\n Cause: Microsoft announced that Office 2016 will be dismissed with supporting connections to M365-Services like SharePoint and OneDrive. (See: Office versions and connectivity to Microsoft 365 services - Deploy Office | Microsoft Learn )\n Issue: Solution would be easy to convert everybody to M365 licenses but with almost 7500 BCs it will be way too expensive and cannot justified against management to have such an rise of expenses for licensing.\n Idea: Then I though, hey let's enable Viewer Mode for M365 products such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They can view but cannot edit them. If they need to edit documents they can use Word Online and we are going to assign them M365 F3. \n But there is the next issue which comes with it:\n They cannot access any network shared files where all the local files are located today. Then they need to manually open OneDrive for Business and Word Online everytime and upload the files which they wanna use, save, download and upload it to the network sahre. This won't work since conflict risk is pretty high at that amount of users.\n This is not a great solution and I am out of ideas since Microsoft does not provide any further information. Before I create a ticket at Microsoft I'd like to ask the community whether you have any ideas and if you may experience the same issue in your company?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Techret  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know we all hate those little yellow Post-It notes with passwords, but‚Ä¶\n So this week my childhood best friend‚Äôs brother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. He was barely fifty. The family had no idea where to start. They didn‚Äôt know if he had a will and, if so, who might be the executor. They didn‚Äôt know his financial relationships. They didn‚Äôt know his insurance policies. They didn‚Äôt know who his lawyer was. He was somewhat secretive, and they were stumped.\n What they did have was a stack of four laptops, ranging from his current laptop to plan older one circa 2004. They brought them to me to see if I could ‚Äúhack‚Äù into them and glean anything that might point them in the right direction. I promised I would do what I could.\n I started with the only one that had a power adapter. I was lucky enough that the default account, ‚Äúuser‚Äù, had no password and had admin rights. I logged in, reset the password for his account, and started hunting. I found a few work-related documents and some photos of his kids and not much else.\n Next, I gathered all the old laptop chargers I had around and tried to fit the laptops. No luck. Where is my universal charger? ugh. Anyway, I opened one of the laptops and what comes fluttering out? A single Post-It Note. I though, ‚ÄúPlease let this be a password‚Äù. We all know that is the main use of these damn yellow sticky papers, right? Well it wasn‚Äôt, but it was just as good. It was a list of names and phone numbers. Lawyer. Banker. Investment advisor. Insurance agent. Mortgage broker. The works.\n Anyway, thank God for little yellow notes, but I still need to get into the laptops. Anyone have any recommendations for boot sticks that might permit resetting SAM accounts, mounting file systems, etc? I used to use Trinity Rescue Kit, but that was half a career ago. I am also hoping nothing is encrypted; wish me luck.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/DrunkenGolfer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I average about 50-60 calls a day, and I'm expected to average 8 minutes per call(which doesn't really happen but ok), and as you know IT problems tend to repeat themselves so i lack to see the logic of logging EVERY call and step I did. There is basically no ticketing system implemented, and it is really maddening when you come to think of it. What's your take on this? I'm 4 months in, and I'm already kinda burned out.\n    submitted by    /u/PricelessAlex  \n [link]   [comments]",

First problem is keep the access documented which is already in process but apart from that is there‚Äôs anything which will help like SSO, where the identity is linked to AD and once their account is made inactive they shouldn‚Äôt be able to authenticate.\n I thought of writing a script which talks to AD server and allow/deny login using SSHCMD or something and keep it in every server but in event of AD failure it‚Äôd be impossible to login to any server.

I thought I had set it up wrong because when I logged out and back in, there was no redirect to the SSO page; it just took my Google password as always. I did some digging and apparently the reason is that I'm a Super Admin for our domain and Google doesn't allow Super Admin accounts to use SSO (unless you're signing in from within a network mask...which I don't understand). I then tested it with multiple end user accounts, and the SSO redirect worked correctly.\n I'm confused. Wouldn't the Super Admin accounts have the biggest need for protection? These are the accounts with the highest privileges. I must be missing something here, right?\n Edit: I understand now. In my head I was thinking SSO implied 2FA, which it doesn't.

You then need to immediately change the MDM to InTune on ABM and force an InTune to ABM sync before you allow it factory reset.

They wouldn‚Äôt have been able to caddy the drive due to TPM but could they have booted off a USB utility tool (Hiren or whatever it is now) and reset the Administrator password and then logged in as local admin and had access to the local user profiles and data?\n If so, is there anyway to mitigate this?

Is there a box/setting the manager has to have selected while making the UKG schedule to have it show up on the UKG Dimensions website/app?

I immediately knew what I did and disabled the forwarding setting and they were able to receive emails again. But emails during forwarding setting was enabled was not in their mailbox. I checked with our l2 team and they said it impossible to do anything in this case. I also did not check keep a copy during forwarding. \n So not only I did not do my job, I created a task for user where they have to request the sender to send the emails again which is a very troublesome task depending on how many emails they received during that time. I requested user to check if the emails could be sent again yesterday. Or they have to contact the distribution list owner and send their emails back.

This seems to correct whatever component store/SXS corruption initially, but the problem is it seems like for many systems, the problem resurfaces in a month or two. We've since had two Premier tickets with Microsoft without any identification of a root cause. We have looked for various underlying trends such as build process, PC model, installed features/software, antivirus, etc but have been unable to pin it down. We're still using WSU, but we don't believe the issue is on the update server side. It just seems that at some point these machines get corrupted and no amount of SFC or DISM will fix them. In place repair will fix them but only temporarily. Anybody else deal with similar issues?

I feel like there‚Äôs a better way to set myself up for success.\n I have the natural instinct to want to ‚Äúfix everything‚Äú and jump right in to the backlog to look productive. Is this a good idea or should I spend a few days/weeks understanding the environment? I want to be helpful but I don‚Äôt want to come off as a know-it-all who says everything needs to be changed. Also, I‚Äôm aware that some organizations want the end solutions but don‚Äôt want the pain of change, so it‚Äòs never a simple process. I feel that starting with documentation may be a better start and mapping out how the IT infrastructure is designed, but not sure what‚Äôs next before getting in the weeds.\n I want to make a good impression and ramp up quickly. But I don‚Äôt want to set an expectation that I will work late because I need work/life balance to be physically & mentally healthy. Is it a bad look to go home on time when you‚Äôve just started a new role.\n  \nThank you for the advice!\n    submitted by    /u/No-Appointment-6353  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I will try to make this explanation short. My company uses an old Enterprise Resource Program (ERP) that uses Java as part of its components. It is truly solely IE dependent for other reasons as well. I have established that over the last 4 years since I began here. I, of course sounded the alarm years ago to management repeatably that IE had an expiration date. They began the lengthy project of upgrading to a cloud version roughly a year ago. This project also is folding in two other ERP programs into this upgrade so you can imagine the huge amount of work going into this. We are projected to go live with this in May.\n I missed the announcement from Microsoft that they would be putting an arrow through the heart of Internet Explorer on Valentines day and I am just discovering users that have had it updated. Basically if you try to use IE it automatically redirects to Edge. The previous settings in Edge under settings>default browser\" allowed you to disable the redirect. That is all gone now. I have tried uninstalling all the MS updates on their computers from Feb 14 to date. But none of them seem to give back the capability to use IE. It seems to be the version of Edge 110.0.1587.46 had the options available so that you could stop it from redirecting. Now under version 110.0.1587.89 they are gone. I am trying to find a way to roll this back and possibly stop a major work stoppage for my company.

Bored in my room I did a network scan of the free WIFI they provided. To my horror I could see everyone else's device, even an old server I think they may not have been using anymore that appear to monitor temperatures. I reported this while there and they promptly locked everything down (essentially just turning on WIFI isolation).\n This time I'm on a cruise ship and not brought my Alfa card with me. Not done an nmap scan as I know about the legality of that. But thought running WIFI shark while I'm connected to check my on ship account shouldn't hurt.

As part of that, we proposed rebuilding our monitoring environment from scratch in order to remove as much of our decade of customization as possible, as it has built-in integration with ServiceNow.\n We are currently using Solarwinds SAM and NPM to monitor our environment - Windows, RHEL, AIX, vCenter & ESX, Nutanix AHV, and Cisco/F5/CheckPoint/PaloAlto networking equipment (along with a few random other manufacturer devices we're monitoring via SNMP); including some items on AWS and Azure.\n The rest of my team has suggested we explore other monitoring solutions that can handle monitoring all of the above items.

I have a big meeting with every manager involved and some changes could happen due to finger pointing between us contractors and county officials. \n Essentially my wishlist would be to have county setup a separate domain controller with no original scripts running, so I can implement what I see fit. \n I believe all I would need access to is a server connected to countydomain2 correct? \n I should have no issue swapping user profiles from one domain to the other.

          "description": "Hi All, \n I have always been confused with the retention policies in M365. So hopefully someone here can clarify this for me. \n If you enable retention policy to retain all data indefinitely in M365 via Microsoft 365 Data Lifecycle Management so it applies globally to all M365 apps (exchange, onedrive, sharepoint etc.). What happens if you disable a user account and remove the license?\n - Will the retention policies be applied to users One Drive?\n - Will the retention policies be applied to users emails? I know its not going to create inactive mailbox but can you still search the emails from/to this users via eDiscovery?\n - What happens after 30 days, 60 days or 90 days when the standard Microsoft retention period (outside M365 Data Lifecycle Management) expires? Will the data get deleted or will the retention policy kick in and all data will still be available via eDiscovery?\n The key here is, I dont care about restoring user data, it is more for compliance/legal purposes so as long as their data is searchable and can be found within e-discovery, I am happy.\n I keep getting conflicting messages from few M365 consultants. Some saying you need to delete the account when the license is still intact otherwise retention policy wont kick in. Others are saying it should apply the retention policy setup globally regardless. I dont want to find it the hard way so im just gathering some information here and there while waiting an official answer from M$.\n    submitted by    /u/Willing_Radio932  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything was pretty normal until I noticed everyone was watching me as I entered \"Bobs office\" just to see my reaction. \n Bob was a special kind of hoarder. Bob liked his paper. Blueprints, White plotter blueprints, Legal sized paper, A4 for some reason, and normal Printer paper. You would think this is normal... and you would be wrong. Bob had this paper from print jobs EVERYWHERE. My words cannot easily describe what I mean by EVERYWHERE. The entire floor.... white paper. Every surface in the office, paper with an avalanche of paper drifting down to the floor... His chair HAD PAPER IN IT with some weird blueprint rolls off the back of the chair making a backrest. I have no idea if his desk was wood or metal because all I saw was paper avalanching off of the 2 sides of the desk not against the wall all the way down to the floor. His monitors were sat on mounds of paper and I had to remove the paper FROM ONTOP OF HIS KEYBOARD!!! Mentally picture fresh powder on a mountain ready for skiing, but replace the snow with paper, this was his entire office, floor to nearly celling. The door would not close because of the 3+ inches of paper on the floor. A normal box of printer paper is 5,000 sheets. His office easily had 500,000 sheets of paper in it, and that may be a conservative estimate because I am over here doing math on how much volume that many sheets of paper would be, and its still not enough. \n When I left the office I played it cool and asked when their last inspection from the Fire Marshall was, the Office Managers face got red and she mumbled something about having \"Bob pick up after himself\".\n    submitted by    /u/stratospaly  \n [link]   [comments]",

To ensure consistent behavior for all users, we highly recommend you enable number match for Microsoft Authenticator push notifications in advance.‚Äù\n The AAD Admin portal still shows Feb. 27th though. \n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-number-match\n    submitted by    /u/F0rkbombz  \n [link]   [comments]",

To get the support phone number, the page says I have to signup (red flag #1), so I ignored that, and found the number somewhere else.\n Called the local line, got the song and typical excuse that \"We are experiencing long queue yada yada\". After picking the printers department and waiting for a while the phone system said \"We have a faster moving line, if you speak english, press x\". Since English is not a problem, I went there.\n A lady picks up, listens to my problem and says she can't help because they don't deal with printers (red flag #2). Wants to give me a long phone number (unrecognizable to me) and refuses to say which country it belongs to, so how can I use it? (red flag #3)\n Realizing she has no idea where I'm calling from, I explain how I reached there, including the fact that I speak 2 languages, to which she says \"Wow, you're so talented!\". This is the part that I'm still laughing about.\n The whole conversation was weird, little bit condescending and silly.

          "description": "Hello,\n I am trying to make a decision based on the fact that i am so over tech support right now\n I am currently a junior sysadmin with experience in PowerShell scripting and very basic programming knowledge in website development. Lately, I have been contemplating a career move to become a software developer. I am looking for advice on whether this move is worth it and what skills or experience I should have to make it happen.\n I have enjoyed my time as a sysadmin, but I am looking for a career that is more fulfilling and flexible. My main goal is to start a business one day as soon as possible, and I am wondering which career path will be more advantageous in this regard. I am starting to enjoy building things, and I am concerned that being a sysadmin will mostly be a tech support role until I get into management. I also can't see how any sysadmin skills will help in business/side hustles until it gets bit enough to need storage and automation. Whereas i feel like building small apps and implementations is possible to do on the side at least if i was to understand development\n I was considering doing a 6 ‚Äì 10 month bootcamp to help transition, but am also considering other options. What are the key differences between being a sysadmin and a software developer? And most importantly, which career path will be more beneficial for starting a business or work for myself in the future, sysadmin/devops route or software development?\n Lastly, holding me back from making this move is that I have recently landed a role as a lone systems admin and have okay money now (90k AUD) and am enjoying 20% of the work (building/scripting things) and the title. Does it get much better? I am worried about losing the stability and the title of my current role, but I also know that sys admin skills aren‚Äôt really transferable to many starting out businesses and side hustles.\n I appreciate any advice or insight. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Shmazdip  \n [link]   [comments]",

During the course of that initial replication copy, there was a root folder on the same drive where the shared folder was being replicated to and that root folder is now gone. Backups were not in production at the time as the server was still being configured. Replication only went one direction (Old Server to New Server) for one folder and its sub folders (IE D:\\SharedFolder\\FolderShares1-6 and User Redirected Folders). this was done as a form of migration of the file servers. \n Now that the folder is gone, I am wondering why would DFS remove that folder if it was not part of the replication.

          "description": "Hi r/sysadmin\n I'm curious how you all go about testing your backups? We have a medium/large sized environment with ~1000 VMs and a few physical servers (most SQL boxes) that we are backing up regularly. 98% Windows, a very select few Linux. However, we don't have a definitive process for testing these backups beyond requested restores that we have to do as people need them.\n Previously, I used Veeam's SureBackup feature to test backups at my previous job, but here we use Commvault and I don't see a similar feature. There does seem to be some sort of backup validation but Commvault's documentation doesn't match what I'm seeing in our console.\n Using Veeam's SureBackup as a model, I started to build out a sandbox network that would mirror our production network, which I could restore VMs into and then run scripts against them to verify they are working. The point I'm more or less stuck at is the \"scripts to verify they are working\" part. For basic Windows boxes I've got a script that checks for running services, and for all the VMs I'm pulling their reported heartbeat status by VMWare, but this is imperfect and doesn't cover some of our more specialized boxes like Exchange or SQL databases. \n Somewhere along the line I think there will be a human element (IE, you are the admin for this server, your server is currently in the sandbox network, login to it and make sure everything works before it gets torn down) but I'd like to automate as much of this process as possible.\n What approach do you take? Is there a feature in Commvault I've missed or a third party tool that solves the problem? Or do you have better ideas on what to check using various scripts and the like?\n    submitted by    /u/Pugway  \n [link]   [comments]",

Latter one wasn't documented at all by it's creator who hase left us in the meantime.\n So around the middle of 2022 I got 4 IGEL licenses to test and that worked pretty fine so far, we decided for the UDP / USB-Version and had no problems occur and the remote assistence etc. helped a lot.

We just route all our mail to the on prem instance and connect Outlook to local exchange.\n The Teams license however does get used for scheduling video calls, and also creating the odd group and channels.\n My understanding is that to do a hybrid migration (and enable it), you can't have existing mailboxes in the cloud and those mailboxes need to be deleted.\n I also understand that Teams stores all the chat data in the mailbox as well. \n So do we need to purge all our existing Team Groups in 365, and chat data as well as - then enable hybrid migration - and re-create them to do our migration successfully? \n We also use SharePoint, but I don't believe that will cause any problems to the exchange migration as far as I know.\n Thanks for your help/input.\n    submitted by    /u/cynocation  \n [link]   [comments]",

Im a first year apprentice, so im still pretty new to all of this.\n Im essentially trying to configure a Syslog-Server with a Webinterface running on an Apache2 Webserver.\n I messed around a bit on my Raspberry PI4, and am now trying to replicate this on a VM at work. However im already failing at accessing the default page of the webserver.\n On my Raspberry PI and at home, all i had to do was install the server, and allow communication through my UFW. After that, i could reach the Default Page via my Raspberrys IP-Adress in my Browser. I assume it tried reaching the server on Port 80 by default.\n This however doesnt work on my VM. Firewall is active, the webserver can accept packages on port 80 and 443. However i cant even ping the VM from inside my network.\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/Powerful-Cucumber-60  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hiya, I work for an organisation with around 400 users, when it comes to Adobe most just use Adobe Reader but we currently have around 60 users licensed for Acrobat Pro and about 20 licensed for Creative Cloud. IT management want to recharge the cost of these licenses to departmental/team cost codes, but we're really struggling with how to keep track of which licenses belong to which team. When a new license is purchased it just goes into one big pool in our Adobe Admin Console, we can allocate it to a new user but there's nothing identifiable about the license itself so no real way to track it as an asset or tag it as owned by a particular team. What would be ideal is a system where we can create groups for different teams and then allocate licenses to each group, I'm just wondering if there's any tool or method that makes this easily possible? Currently all I think to do is have a process of meticulous record keeping in an Excel workbook where we track how many licenses are purchased under each cost code and who is using each license, but this obviously isn't ideal. We need to ensure that licenses are kept within the teams that are paying for them rather than moving around the organisation as people join and leave.\n    submitted by    /u/UpYourGravitas  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I like about Teamviewer and Anydesk is that I download 1 app that I can connect from and to. It seems the ones I tried all need a different host and client app(splashtop), need logging in from a browser (google, screenconnect), need to create a secured token per session (screenconnect), or shortkeys can't be used (google). I don't need any bells and whistles since I'm not offering remote support, I just need basic control of my own laptops. A steady connection to about 12 laptops from 3-4 laptops in a directors booth with the possibility of connecting through a code with a possibility to remember/save the connections that I made will do just fine. \n Anyone got a suggestion for a well functioning, really basic and cheaper alternative to Teamviewer/Anydesk?\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/biski9  \n [link]   [comments]",

I get a phone call just before, saying that they just realised that someone pressed the break glass button to exit the building. The emergency button had a case around it and looked very different from the exit one which is touch-free.\n A couple of days later, when setting their cards, I could see that someone would answer the intercom and they would go to open the door manually. But this one is on me, I did not leave specific instructions on how to unlock it. \n #3 Once got called in to help someone find the attach button from outlook.

          "description": "OK, so every tutorial out there makes this more confusing than it needs to be, as far as I understand it. I've been running my own mailservers (I know, it's a challenge) for about 25 years now, fairly successfully (my server's mail gets accepted by the big players, which was a tough task to accomplish over the years, but I finally got Microsoft to clear my IP-addresses, even though they assumed they were part of an entirely bad reputable block of addresses). OK, so here I am, strange how even I question the use of _dmarc every now and then. As a result of weird behavior while migrating from server 1 to server 2 I had to change _dmarc policy to none.\n SPF is correct, DKIM passes for all, but I just want to be certain;\n All mail account users and mail-domains reside behind one hostname and one IPv4 and one IPv6 address. They all send and receive mail using those, SMTP is on that one address. Am I still correct in assuming that setting policy to \"reject\" should be fine then?\n No other servers should try and send mail using any of our system's domain names. If they do, mail should be rejected. None of my users try to use gmail or others to use our email-addresses as aliases, so that problem is non existent. And websites using these domainnames, that may have mail-forms are all using our smtp as well. Are there any exceptions to this that I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/jultus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, \n I'm trying to determine the best systems to use and wanted to get your opinions. \n Current environment:\n  \nEmployees: 70\n IT: 1 member\n Mixed environment - Windows/Mac computers (80/20) + Linux VMs. \n Computers are not managed/domain-joined. \n \n The majority of the business workloads reside on AWS. \n Small on-prem footprint - local server for internal application/file server \n File server is used to temporarily store files generated locally before it is then uploaded to AWS for processing. \n \n Google workspace is used for email, storage, etc. \n Currently using Google SSO to authenticate to other SaaS applications. \n \n Microsoft 365 is also in place with similar licensing as Google Workspace. \n Primarily used for office suite/collaboration via SharePoint. \n \n  \nIdeally, I would like to tie everything to a single IDP and need a device to serve local DHCP (multiple VLANs)/DNS for internal resources. \n I was leaning toward a hybrid environment since there is already some on-prem infrastructure so I was planning to spin up an AD environment off the same hardware. \n Alternatively, I was considering a cloud-only environment leveraging AzureAD/Intune but in this scenario, I would want to migrate everyone off GW to M365 to take advantage of the additional features offered like conditional access, etc.\n The last option I am considering is JumpCloud. It seems to meet my requirements as far as a centralized directory, IDP, policies, and support for MacOS/Linux. But I never used this platform before so uncertain how it performs. \n Any feedback is much appreciated. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/EfficientBottle7  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, I have nothing against Crowdstrike, its a great product, specially if you have Overwatch, however, it lacks on network protection and web filtering, and since this is a must have (in my opinion), the company needs to spend more money on a third party software (like dnsfilter for example).\n Since MS Defender for business is included in their license, I‚Äôm inclined to recommend them to make the switch from Crowdstrike to MS Defender for business. Then, with the money that is saved, buying dnsfilter (or other product) for an extra layer of protection , and invest more on security awareness training for the users and still save a lot of money!\n Would you do the same?\n P.S: I know Crowdstrike is a great product and security is not about saving money, but in this case I think we can actually improve their overall security by moving to defender.\n    submitted by    /u/scmdzd  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all! We are running a product documentation portal using WordPress (not the best solution I know, but development time was essential) and IIS 10 on Windows Server 2022. Access to this portal is delegated by us, so nobody can register on his own. If a user wants to access the documentation files (pdf, zip, etc.), he must log in to the portal.\n All files are currently in the data/ folder which is in the root folder of the app that is also exposed by IIS on the internet. The data/ folder is custom made and not part of WP by default. The issue with this situation is that everybody that knows the folder name and filename can directly access it as an anonymous user, which is a security risk (for instance, if our domain is example.com, you can navigate to example.com/data/sample.pdf and download the file without logging in).\n Is there a solution on how to set it up in the web.config or some setting in IIS that you can prevent that behavior? I'd like that only users logged into the WP portal can download the files.\n I thought about moving the data/ folder from the app root folder into a folder that is not directly exposed by IIS, but I believe that WordPress would have huge problems accessing that files.\n Edit: I believe IIS (and not WP) is allowing anonymous users to download the files in the data/ folder as it is exposed to the internet. The general idea I'm currently looking at is how to tell IIS which user is authenticated by WP and which is not? Maybe by looking at a Cookie or something?\n    submitted by    /u/lostje89  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some time ago I made the switch to another company: less hours, better pay, shorter commute - all really nice things. But what I appreciate the most is how my new manager treats us: I had to do an upgrade for a business critical application (we talk multiple millions in revenue just from this application per week) after hours. It was scheduled to start at 5.45pm, but at 5.30 I got a call \"we need till\" 6pm. Ok, no problem. But you know how it turned out... At 7.30pm I finally could start to shut down the running services. Unfortunately the installation routine runs for up to 60 minutes, even if it fails. So of course this happened multiple times and after some digging around in the log files and doing multiple steps manually that should run automatically, I was finished at around 1.30 in the morning.\n I informed my manager the next day (back at work at 8am) and his response was \"First: Next time just tell them you will not start after the agreed upon time. It's our job to make sure this stuff works, but we are not responsible if they can't finish their work in time. Second: if something like this happens again, feel free to call me for support. I am usually awake till 2am anyways so just give me a call! Third: Go home and sleep - if you work longer hours, just come in later so you can get enough rest\".\n Feeling the support of the people above me and knowing they will stand up for me and help is worth much more than all the things that made me switch jobs in the first place. For the first time in the last two years I enjoy my work again.\n And yes, I did take him by his word the next time something didn't go right: at 10pm I called him. He tried to help me figure it out and at 11 told me \"I don't know what's wrong. You can stop now, I will take over‚Äú.\n    submitted by    /u/Craneson  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is a little surprising, as I understood that greater geographic distance from the server would increase 'ping' times, but actual download speeds should remain mostly unaffected?\n I am generally seeing speed test results that show connection speeds of ~40mb/s through public wifi networks being reduced to somewhere around ~4mb/s-- 10% of the actual underlying connection speed!\n I am looking at setting up another Lightsail instance in Singapore and cloning my OpenVPN files onto it.

          "description": "I worked on ERP software at two separate businesses that was published by one of the largest software vendors in the world. That crap hasn't changed in any fundamental way since the 50s, no joke. They kept adding \"modules\" that you had to pay for which supposedly gave the software new functionality. In reality, they were user requested changes to code that didn't work correctly in the first place. Companies were literally paying even more money for upgrades and updates that should have been provided by the vendor. The software was so error prone and full of bugs it made me shiver with rage every time we paid the maintenance agreement.\n The money they burned trying to keep that shit marginally functional was appalling. Support was sold to overseas call centers which made even the most mundane issue a days long slog. They would always promise big new changes were coming and year after year they would dole out a new sliver that made the software slightly more usable than before, for a price. It was just a glorified DB with no real higher functionality. Data mining was an arduous manual process with no tools etc. to facilitate. It relied heavily on external tools for basic use including a gawd awful java interface that barely functioned. \n It was slow, clunky, and contained NO automation of basic daily tasks. I invented multiple ways to mine what we needed and analyze millions of records for pertinent data. The lack of even basic input checks meant people were entering erroneous data on the regular that needed to be pruned, edited, or replaced. It became my full time job just keeping the wheels on. I will never work for another business that uses that crap as long as I live.\n    submitted by    /u/FatalDiVide  \n [link]   [comments]",

It reads and writes case info to a local mssql database to pull in each shipment's info and to write a tracking number to the case in the DB.\n We ship a lot, 350+ packages a business day easily\n Anyone that has dealt with worldship, knows it doesn't scale well to this volume, but I've made it work through weekly db maintenance on the admin and various tweaks etc. So yes it works, but it's the kinda free program that isn't really free and when there's a problem their support is useless and one of the IT team has to stay late.\n So I'm wondering if anyone here has a shipping platform they like that can do all these things. Cloud and web based would be amazing as long as they can pull up the shipment info by scanning an invoice, plop it on the usb scale, hit a button and then it prints on a networked label printer. We are currently in one building, but we are outgrowing it, so the quick scalability of a browser based cloud app is desirable. I imagine the ui would be more modern than the xp/Vista asthetic of worldship too.\n We've looked into a few, like shiprush for example but, while they would work, they seem geared more towards Ecommerce orders and the onprem sql integrations are an after thought.\n So anyone here have recommendations for a shipping platform geared more towards manufacturing enterprises?\n Thanks friends!\n    submitted by    /u/DarkSideMilk  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the moment this is the flow of tasks:\n - HR is opening a ticket with the new user's details (name, position, department, manager, mobile phone number);\n - we're creating a Office365 mailbox via the on-premise Exchange cp (it's a hybrid environment) and that creates the AD user;\n - we add the details on the user's AD profile (all of the above, they are used for dynamic group membership mostly);\n - the user is synced to AAD;\n - we assign the O365 licenses as needed.\n Obviously, there's also the task of preparing the laptop, joining it to AD and Intune and install specific apps on it, but that's another discussion I believe, right now I want to focus on the other tasks that I mentioned.\n So, any of you have some ideas on how can this be automated?

They currently have a combination of Active Directory, synching to AzureAD, but using ADFS for Auth. In addition to using ADFS for 365 authentication, they are also using several other applications (box.com for example) as well as using LDAP against the on-prem for some on-prem apps.\n They are eager to move to AzureAD (or another cloud IdP) to remove dependency on On-Prem.\n My thinking is that each app that uses ADFS is going to be handled differently. And that each one needs to be \"cutover\", there is unlikely to be any way to stage or transition from one Identity source to another.\n For 365 and Sharepoint and other MS Apps, i plan to recommend using Staged Mode, as they have some automation and workflows that have the expected ADFS webpage hard coded into their authentication, so i will leave the identitites used there in ADFS until they are \"dev'd\" out.\n Staging mode should in no way affect the third party apps, am i correct?\n My method is along the lines of \n Enable PHS in ADConnect & Seamless SSO -> Enable Staging Mode -> Migrate majority of Human Users to Staging Group (I can move the Automation Accounts as their devs update the app to support this)\n The above has no impact on the 3rd party apps, correct?\n But what about if/when i change my domain in AzureAD away from Federated to Managed? Does that impact?\n Ive been doing a lot of reading, and seen plenty of people say that they read too much into this, it ended up not being as complicated as expected.

          "description": "I am considering methods to connect remotely to my iMac across the internet from an iPad Pro. Ideally I will avoid services that enable the connection via an unrestricted server (udp holepunch) even when the service is advertised as encrypted (so teamviewer, jump and even vpns are excluded).\n I prefer direct connections (ssh for terminal access and rdp for the windows but don't like the risk associated with port forwarding. My solution is to implement tcp wrapper on the server and either restrict the client access to the smallest range of IP addresses from whichever location I am at or each time I connect, restrict the IP address to my actual IP address at the time. To configure the tcp wrapper I would connect to the server using jump and then once I have configured it take down that connection and then come in directly using rdp and ssh (with access restricted to my remote IP address only). The jump ‚Äúdaemon‚Äù will run for 5 minutes periodically (say, once or twice an hour) so the jump connection will only be available within that window.\n In summary use the udp holepunch style services (jump, Team viewer, vpn) as a way of initialising the direct connection and as a backdoor route if I manage to lock myself out but do 99% of my connectivity directly. If I am able to restrict access to just the range of IP addresses used by whatever ISP I am coming in from, I might only have to configure tcp_wrapper once for each ISP from which I am connecting. If that isn't viable, I am cool with re-initialising each time my remote IP changes.\n I should add that all my important passwords are 16 chars in length and all have lower case, upper case, numbers and special chars so I feel fairly protected against brute force attacks.\n what do you think of this plan?\n thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/macseguro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I figured out how to semi-automate them in a month, and my boss got tired of finding things for me to do, so he put me on business analysis for our service processes and a migration.\n Three years ago we migrated multiple systems, our lead admin resigned on short notice, and I basically inherited his responsibilities over brand-new software and infrastructure. \n Two years ago I got promised the lead job due, and a month later my VP-level boss got forced out and I was told 'you are a developer 100% of the time now, hand off all analyst and admin duties to....[null???]'\n A year and a half ago I got saddled with snd set up a new inventory system, migrated mobile to AAD and Intune, and refreshed 500 mobile devices mostly single-handedly, then got told to hand it off instantly to the help desk. No admin status, back to 'do what you're told' development.\n One year ago I wasted most of my time teaching other teams the basics of Agile, AD, business analysis, and got told I couldn't speak to other admins over Windows and Websphere and Salesforce because 'I caused more trouble by sharing information.' They replaced our business analysts and PMs with 'product owners' they scrounged from other departments and forced into roles they don't understand, and told us not to talk to the business or face consequences.\n Five months ago I interviewed for an asset manager position for $20k more in an entirely different department, got an instant offer, and my C-Level immediately calls to offer me the same pay scale and the long-promised lead position a day later, provided they put the job up for anyone to apply to. I explained I had an outside offer for double what I was just offered (but with way fewer benefits and leeway).\n I played hardball in 2022-2023, management got scared about losing me, and I finally got the job.\n    submitted by    /u/fluffy_warthog10  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, so we are working on a deployment plan for Microsoft Laps across several environments and I'm looking into some of the timing questions. I've looked over the documentation and the overall setup/etc doesn't look too bad and we will run this through lab/pilot groups of course. \n My questions is, is there any downside to predeploying the laps client (prior to schema changes/etc)? Getting the client out is easy enough (deployment solution)... but like everywhere else in the last two years our workforce has scattered across the country lol. The deployment could take a week or two to complete and for some units we may want to be a bit more aggressive on the timeline to rollout.\n Also, any thoughts on this being deployed for servers? Again... this seems pretty strait forward assuming avoiding things like domain controllers/etc. Any other big gotchas we should be looking for/might see?\n Should have added...most of our environments are fairly simple domains but some are wide spread. In any case, I appreciate any thoughts or insights into this (even beyond what is mentioned).

I can find plenty of pros and cons online about the general features and performance of each platform but I have a very specific concern about this potential switch over and that is the control and admin of the cloud recordings, let me explain.\n Zoom has a wonderful admin interface that allows us to see all cloud recordings in one place, this is used mainly in our Sales department. It is especially helpful when a user leaves the business, we are able to transfer all their Zoom cloud recordings to their line manager as we delete their Zoom account with ease.\n Google Meet seems to have a very bare bones approach to Meeting recordings. By default it will just save a recording to the meeting hosts Gdrive and that's it, no option to transfer to another user (i.e their manager) and no centralised control over these recordings.\n ‚Äã\n Am I totally seeing this wrong or is Zoom the clear winner in recording management with the meetings and calls?\n    submitted by    /u/Helpdesk_Peon  \n [link]   [comments]",

That part is clear. \n But who decides the actual point in time when the switchover from old to new occurs ? AS2 uses a 1:N relation, you have 1 private key for n partner relations, so switchover should be done in concert.\n But looking at my AS2 server (mendelson) it appears not to \"try\" to use its new key when a partner sends a file using our new public key. It knows both its old and new keys.\n Is this some RFC all AS2 implementation suffer from or just un-user-friendly implementation ?\n I have a hard time believing I have to send a precise date/time to all my AS2 partners to make switchover successfull ?\n ‚Äã\n thanks\n    submitted by    /u/unannunciated  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is a packing station, we print over network directly from SAP spooler, labels are .pdf.\n I tried everything humanly possible from direct import of the config file from other zebras to side by side going through both internal config utility and ZSU, gave it an hour or two of tinkering and then gave up (ultimately, barcode so it's usable it just looks funny and bit hard to read).\n So the main difference what I found was printer resolution.

This is for a future production environment. I am taking the sysadmin role in a small company and I originally learned computer sciences with a focus on application development, so while I know the basics I am missing a lot of experience with implementing servers. \n What I want to do:\n I'll have a central Ubuntu server that runs as a NAS and possibly run VMs for workloads (simulations, renders and a database). I need to manage permissions for user groups and individual users. I also want access via VPN for homeoffice users and would like to manage a universal login for every user (would be perfect to be able to import these) and not have several logins. \n I am aware of Windows Active Directory but since I decided not to bother with Windows as my server OS (mainly because of licensing and compatible database software) I want to do that on a Linux Server. \n Basically I want to manage access so that only specific groups of users or specific users can access certain folders, thats the most important thing right now. There are aproximately 30 users but the number will grow in the future. Clients are all using Windows and if I could use the windows login as authentication for server access that would be perfect.\n Its my first time planning a complex server setup from scratch with user management, but I want it to be well plannned and documented, so any help and advice would be appreciated. I am open to suggestions about the general server or network architecture and the software I'll use, but my Hardware needs to at least host a NAS, a DBMS and ideally a VM.\n Please let me know if anny more information is necessary and thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/tho3maxi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am looking for a new one so maybe I can get some inspiration.\n I am working in IT - Server management\n currently got a Lenovo t14 from work with their image so its not my personal one. looking for a windows machine with bright display and maximum 2560px resolution, bc too much is bad for battery. life. I want to be able to work a whole day. I know that's not possible but maybe there is a laptop for 8h use with simple tasks like surfing and doin ssh. Also important for me is the performance. I want desktop class performance when I need it for adobe e. g. and want to be able to turn off the GPU and use the CPU integrated one for maximum battery life... might need to write a script for that^^ Screen size between 14 and 16 inch. 14 inch is a bit to small for me but would work.\n ‚Äã\n Looking into getting the X1 Extreme from Lenovo.\n What are you guys running and in which use case?

Anyway I have a pretty serious problem I think and would def appreciate some advice. \n So the company I‚Äôm working for conducts certification training and has 100 or so workstations (split between 15 corporate employees and 85 student computers). Every computer has windows 10 enterprise installed but I have no clue where the licensing information is. The computers are also so old there‚Äôs no original license key burned into the motherboard. The admin who set this all up died and his replacement was clueless. When a computer needed to be reimaged he used keys from visual studio :( (all I can do is put a sad face here). \n So here‚Äôs my question, am I right to assume that I would need to contact a license broker and purchase a windows 10 pro volume OEM license? Does anyone have any idea how much that might cost for 100 computers? \n Also, I think enterprise would be better for the corporate employees. We already have E3 licenses and are a silver partner with Microsoft. Once there‚Äôs a legit windows installation and the machine is added in azure I think that would check that block, but would there be any reason to also upgrade student computer from pro to enterprise (I don‚Äôt think so)?\n    submitted by    /u/hihcadore  \n [link]   [comments]",

If so, did you stumble upon something unexpected? Any other Distros you would recommend checking out? \n Thanks for your time!\n    submitted by    /u/zxcase  \n [link]   [comments]",

See, if you had the multimedia macro you'd just put the macro on the page and select the video. \n Well, what you do is you download the videos to your hard drive and then drag and drop them back to the site and then delete the duplicate videos that are now attached.\n Seriously? Did I get this wrong or is this the official answer coming from support? \n Official answer. There's two feature requests related to fixing this feature gap, one is from 2018 and the other from 2019. \n And that's how it goes.

I have noticed recently that I am drinking probably more than I should. It isn't impacting my work \"yet (and hopefully never)\" but it is impacting other facets of my life. I went to my first AA meeting last Friday. It was a powerful experience. \n I remember hearing people during the pandemic times say people are going to come out of this as a Hunk, a Chunk or a Drunk. I think I, unfortunately at in the 3rd group. \n I am trying to work the program, but DAMN it is tough. Being someone in Technology, are there any resources that you guys/gals know about that can provide online help between those meetings?\n Are there any resources that people have used that can help people through this process\n thanks\n keep on, keeping on!!\n    submitted by    /u/apperrault  \n [link]   [comments]",

My previous role nearly reached the same point, but I left before I got to that.\n It's been brewing in me for some months now, managed to get a pay rise in the summer (but IT pay in the UK is dogshit anyway). The userbase we support is increasing, but we're horrendously understaffed, no time to research new technologies, we're locked in with garbage fucking systems because somehow it's not our decision. Somehow spend more time doing what should be a dedicated first line support's job, instead of doing actual system infrastructure maintenance. Sales guy is letting small clients set up BYOD systems and then trying to impose lockdowns on their personal devices, including using Intune/Endpoint Manager with a bunch of fucking Macbooks, then coming to me for help (spoiler: I can't)\n But yesterday, I had the full blown meltdown. Simple task, user needs printer/scanner installing. It's an older HP so probably won't be too much of a bastard to sort. Log on, no admin access for some reason, looks like Intune hadn't been applying the settings, and of course, Intune gives 0 useful information as to why. So it's possible the user is still an admin. Try to get him to elevate, he's not doing it and keeps cancelling, then he brings up HP Smart and disappears for 20 minutes and I get disconnected. Later get an email saying \"all working, thanks\"\n Just lost it. Why is such a simple task such a twat to do? Why is our IT structure so broken?\n Good people to work for, just not a good company\n Had an interview today, big pay rise, decent looking company.

At the time, I told them such and normally my opinions have weight, but this time I was outnumbered and they were locked in. Another in my cohort at this meeting, we will call him Mr. Z, is the kind of person who gleefully runs and does whatever upper management asks. He was as much for it as I was against it. So this thing got legs and ran.\n It's my role to sell some of these upper management decisions to the group, and do what was needed to make them successful. This time that wasn't possible. It was too draconian. It directly impacted people and their time. All I could do was offer some help. But I presented it as neutrally as possible so as not to throw anyone under the bus because it's just never good to openly do so. As a result they thought I initiated it, which normally I live with but this time was different.\n When the complaints from the field started coming in, people didn't want to say anything to me directly so they went to Mr. Z much to my surprise. Mr. Z then didn't own up to the fact that he was a big part of why this idea went forward. He just quietly listened, sympathized, and then went about his day. I know this because I overheard one of these conversations.\n At that point I called a WebEx with everyone in the field, apologized for the nightmare and the impact it had, and gathered data with all of their feedback on the recent issue. Everyone was 100% against it and all of the suggestions to fix it aligned. I then presented that data to upper management and requested to make modifications to the idea so it could work. It was more work to fix it but it needed to be fixed with urgency.\n This crisis was averted, but it cost valuable time and had an impact on my street cred.

My direct supervisor is the 2nd in command for the whole school system, and he became more and more furious over this request as I brought it up to him over our break. He clearly is on my side in this, which means case closed, it's not happening. \n I've chatted up the admin at the high school since on numerous occasions, and it has never once come up in conversation. Having 6 carts full of laptops charging in the room every day has helped, as there would be no space at all for this stuff. Between that, a laminator, a sound system for our gym, and countless spare machines, it would be impossible to fit all that stuff into their proposed \"space\", never mind trying to cram a pair of bodies in there with our desks to boot. \n All in all, I wanted to update everyone to let you all know that it worked, and that I am still master of my domain (puns for days). I know my employees appreciate my hard line I took in this matter, but I also wanted to thank all of you for supporting my choices in this matter. It's one of my highest rated posts on here, and I got a lot of great feedback from members of this sub. IT people deserve better than the crap we get from most people, and all the IT folks I talk to, even in conversations today, agree with me. We are not often treated with respect and dignity, but I'm not going to let that happen on my watch, with my staff, for as long as I am employed here. \n So thanks again, and feel free to comment or message me any questions you might have about working on a First Nations reserve, or in a FN school.

He sends the mail to our client.\n However, now the mail he has send is showing up in the shared mailbox sent items. Every user can now read the mail in send items. It shows the personal from adres from our user. For me this is 100% reproducible, as i take the same steps. I would expect the reciever to get the mail as send on behalf of the shared mailbox, but to the reciever it shows as a mail recieved by the personal mailbox. The header of the mail also has no sign what so ever from the shared mailbox. \n Now this is kinda a red flag, as this would mean that user in our organisation might think he is typing a private message to someone else, only to show up in the sent items of the shared mailbox..\n What am I missing?

Add this node to the cluster and run it in Mixed-OS mode. Then do the same on the other node and lastly run \"Update-ClusterFunctionalLevel\". \n But is that really the most efficient way to do it?\n In the first linked article \"Upgrading Failover Clusters on the same hardware\" in the overview part it is written:\n  \nUpgrading the operating system on an existing failover cluster is only supported when going from Windows Server 2016 to Windows 2019.

(Single port , 2nd is currently disabled)\n Normal fix of restarting Network Location Awareness and Network list service failed (NL hang)..\n Multiple reboots did not work although i could always log onto the console using the domain credentials.\n ‚Äã\n Fixes tried:\n Turned on preference for ipv4 over ipv6\n Downgraded the network drivers, Upgraded the network drivers, played with Ethernet metrics (temp fix only)\n EDIT:\n Set NLA to Delayed start (did NOT help)\n Fix that worked:\n Set a dependency for DNS for the NLA service in the registry.\n Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\NlaSvc\n DependOnService -add DNS to the list\n Reboot. Problem solved.\n However the system still says Metered (even though it does not appear to be turned on, can download, full speed tests, etc.). I found references to this problem but no solutions so far if anyone has any ideas.\n Hope this saves someone else some precious time.\n    submitted by    /u/Wise-Craft2113  \n [link]   [comments]",

To date, they are strewn about many different emails, SharePoint sites and Teams. Obviously this isn't sustainable.\n I'm not adverse to buying new software for this, however I generally am not a fan of niche software that isn't integrated with the rest of our systems.\n An ideal system would allow for certain people to update policies, but most (or all) employees being able to see the policies. It must either integrate with M365 or just be a solution native to the platform. Ideally folks would be able to track changes to the policy with different versions to see what's changed, and maybe get an alert when there is a new or updated policy.\n I figure I could do most of this with SharePoint but feels like I'd be building a lot of it from scratch.

I remoted in and checked vsphere and sure enough, one of the three hosts at that site had a connection state issue. I acknowledged the alarm and checked the VPN circuit. It was pegged out (some type of NAS backup was running, this is not unusual). I cancelled the backup and the circuit went back to a normal state.\n I was thinking that host 1 would come back but it never did. I tried signing into ESXi through the web interface for the host, but the connection would time out on the page after putting in my credentials and hitting login. Tried SSH and I would get a connection refused. Logged in through iDRAC, rebooted the host. It came up without issue.\n So then, this happens on another host, we will call it host 2. Same deal, same site. I also cannot log into ESXi. I ended up getting into the iDRAC and rebooting the host. When it came up, it resynced and all was well. \n FAST FORWARD AN HOUR LATER.\n I get an alarm that the third host is down and that an HA Event had failed. I logged in, one of my datastores is inaccessible and the third host is now down. This one, I cannot even get into the iDRAC, web interface or SSH.\n I got someone that was near the site to go and reboot the host manually from the rack, it came back up without issue. As for the datastore, I went into the connection & multipathing screen and had to manually mount it back to the first 2 hosts that we rebooted.\n All is back up and no alarms. I had generated support bundles to have VMWare check on this monday. Wow what a Saturday.\n    submitted by    /u/Weak-Peak1015  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I was just offered another role through a different company, fully remote sysadmin for about $85,000/yr. \n My questions are mainly... based on anyone else's experience in sysadmin work in the Midwest, should I try to aim for closer to $90k based on my experience? \n Should I just shut up and take the money??

The objective is to create corresponding setup guides and compile the necessary lab setup resources together for the team's future use. Our repository hasn't been updated since the system's deployment. Right now, I'm working on the setup of a particular server in the lab, which was only introduced during the system's mid-life upgrade. As such, there were no setup documentation for it and I had to reverse engineer the existing server to make guides for it from scratch.\n One of the software deployed in the system is SharePoint Portal Server 2003.

I searched high and low and haven't been able to find the SP3 installer anywhere in my office's repositories. The official download link from Microsoft is dead too.\n Does anyone know where I can get this file (likely named SPS2003SP3-kb923644-fullfile-ENU.exe - KB923644), or where I can go to ask?

Earlier this week at my workplace I had a iSCSI target from a Synology RackStation RS3614xs+ NAS (DSM 6.2.2-24922) suddenly disconnect overnight on a Windows Server. When I started investigating after noticing the issue, DSM tells me in the storage manager that \"There is no volume in your system\". 12-disk RAID6 is fine, alive and healthy, S.M.A.R.T. of all disks displays a \"Normal/Healthy\" status so nothing to worry about I think (only 1 disk mentioned 1 bad sector at the time after the sudden target disconnect). Storage pool is also operating normally from what DSM shows.\n I can still access the target, the data is still there but this volume \"missing\" in DSM is getting me a little worried.\n Every other RackStation NAS (configured with iSCSI/LUNs) we have currently running and everything I see on the web says that on a Synology NAS a LUN is located on a volume (like Volume 1) and not straight on a storage pool.\n I'm no expert in storage topics and still learning but everything I see in my investigation of the issue points in the direction that this is not a normal behavior. I searched on the web for a similar experience and cannot find cases where LUNs point straight to storage pool location instead of like an ext4 volume for example.\n What are your thoughts about this?\n Please let me know if additional context and details (even logs or output of CLI commands) are needed.\n Thanks in advance for your insight, and have a nice day!\n    submitted by    /u/gtkshroom  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you use SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Widget it displays \"We weren't able to start your app.\" and an error code which indicates an operation was not supported.\n I've considered Edge fullscreen but the web-based can only cast to Spotify Connect devices they've previously registered and as this is at a school, giving access to an unauthenticated web browser is something I'd rather avoid.\n Another potential is BlissOS (Androidx86) but then I need to put in time to get that working with an MDM if it is even possible.\n If I can get it working, I'll design a secure-ish wall mount and 3D print as many as needed. (we have 30 of them) I was also considering using them for control panels for certain building automations (is there a more commercial focused option like homeassistant?) and also for using with Xibo for digital signage.\n Background: I'm the solo IT person for a special school, always looking for cheaper ways of doing things which make these kids' lives a bit better.

Its one of those things that happen in IT where if I were to tell someone they would instantly think it was bs. And in the moment you don't quite believe whats happening yourself.\n So, this school they have a 40mbps VDSL line. As you can imagine with over 200 devices on the network at times this is pretty slow. Today the download speed was 0.4 mbps with a 800ms ping. How they survive on this I will never know. I'm constantly trying to get them to upgrade to fibre but they just do not have the budget to do that. There network equipment is a mess too, they have a Dell Sonicwall router about 12 year old and Cisco switches from about 10 years ago. They recently upgraded a couple of switches to unifi and how have unifi ac pro access points.\n ‚Äã\n Today I was going round seeing if anyone had any issues in their classrooms and a staff member approached me asking why they had been asked to turn off ALL devices in their class. I walked around and everybody was turning all their devices off, it felt like apocalypse scene in a movie. The person who told them to turn everything off I went and asked her why this had happened and her response was \"I needed to download a large file and the internet is too slow\". I couldn't stop laughing. I had never heard of anything so outrageous in my life. The funny thing was, 75% devices dropped off the network and the speed was 2mbps download. \n ‚Äã\n Its so hard working with schools to improve their tech when they quite literally don't have the budget to upgrade stuff. They upgraded their servers a couple years ago but that was because they literally failed constantly.\n ‚Äã\n Thought this story was too funny not to share.\n    submitted by    /u/aaronf151  \n [link]   [comments]",

We also have a group policy that we designed for Windows 10 that deploys the info for all the SSIDs across all offices to all computers. It is set to reach out to RADIUS to verify ID, so users never have to log in.\n This GPO works great on all Windows 10 machines, and according to our other SysAdmin, it worked fine for 11 until 22H2 dropped. Now, users see the network that was pushed by GPO, but it tells them they \"Can't connect to this network\".\n I can log in to one of the Win11 machines and manually tell it to get on the \"Hidden Network\" and give it all the info, and that manually configured one works fine.\n If I check the GPO on the Win11 machine, Computer Configuration>Windows Settings>Security Settings>Wireless Network (IEEE 802.11) Policies and open the policy we created, then open the properties of the network, then go to the Security tab. I verify that it is using Secured Password (EAP-MSCHAP v2) as the Authentication Method and click Configure, but the EAP MSCHAPv2 properties window that pops up has the \"When connecting: Automatically use my Windows logon name and password (and domain if any) box unchecked and is greyed out. On the Win10 machines, though, that is checked.\n Given that, I'm assuming that the reason they can't connect is due to the Windows logon name and password not being pushed.

Unfortunately we are on windows so all the linux thing's I'm thinking of aren't going to work.\n X could be any combination of these; \n  \nstart/stop service\n place a provided file in a location (not shared folder)\n read & report contents of a text file\n run a executable\n pretty much anything you can do CLI\n  \nFor example at the moment I find myself updating OpenVPN. Place the provided msi in Downloads, stop the service, run the installer, check for installer errors, start service, after 1 minute delay open the OpenVPN log and review for errors. The error review in this case requires a human but if it simply dumped the log file somewhere I can get to it on a orchestration machine, renamed it with what server it came from that would be perfect. \n I'm searching and finding a LOT of posts about automating windows updates, but I think we finally have WSUS under control.\n    submitted by    /u/Nephilimi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello fellow sysadmins, I need to run a sanity check hope you can shed some light.\n I've inherited an environment, I'm still discovering and learning about it. It's an on-prem bare-metal/VMware, public cloud is minimal and completely independant. One concern that I have is that I'm seen some odd DHCP reservations for productions servers.\n To give an idea, I've seen DHCP reservation for MS-SQL database server, Domain controllers (all of them), Application Servers, anything that seems to be a production server where many people connect to, it is likely to have a reservation.\n Then in some cases, not all of them, the server has a static IP address assigned, despite of having a reservation. And you probably guess it, the IP address statically assigned to that server is in the DHCP range where other Desktop computers are also connected. This causes that the DHCP report the reservation as inactive.\n From the other side of the fence the monitoring system which is simple doing ICMP every once in awhile detects that host is down. There are no connectivity problems in some occasions when I manually check.\n In some other instances the ESXi web UI is inaccessible, I've experienced myself a duplicate IP caused by one of my computers that took the exact reserved IP address which belongs to that ESXi.\n My question is simple. Is this a normal practice to heavily rely on DHCP reservations to manage mission critical servers IP addressing? My personal bias to decimate that configuration. Go back to traditional static IP addressing, pushing the DHCP range to leave room for server addressing.\n On what scenarios a DHCP reservation would make sense to keep when dealing with servers that run network services that should be available to employees.\n    submitted by    /u/Proper-Obligation-97  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mainly around Teams setup as each site will likely be Teams enabled.\n I understand there are varying degrees of complexity depending on depth of Teams integration but have narrowed it down to 3 options.\n  \nSetup each department with their own site and dump folders alongside General. No private channels at this stage but, if setup down the line, there'll be nothing in General for users who are added (I understand the new Shared Channel option fixes this but seems fine to just keep everything alongside General anyway. Users can't delete the General folder but can delete the contents).\n Setup one site and create Private channels for the various departments. Easier to manage from a permissions standpoint as we can delegate channel owners to add and remove members. Downside is limit on number of private channels per team (will probably be under that though). I can map private channels to File Explorer but the name doubles-up (can fix this by customising the desktop.ini file).\n Let SharePoint migration tool dump everything to one site and call it a day. Deal with permission changes as needed.\n  \nAlso keen on references to other guides or scripts for checking file conflicts outside of the SharePoint migration tool. Been trying to research best practices for a while but the info keeps changing since the platform keeps evolving. Also saw a guide about using metadata rather than folders so they're accessible from more than one location but that seems like even more work/complexity.\n TIA\n    submitted by    /u/Ssufferin_Ssuccotash  \n [link]   [comments]",

That being said, a few duties of my job include, maintaining the corporate network, maintaining our cyber risk standards (updates, anti-virus, MFA, etcetc), and Helpdesk for other employees.\n What's interesting is that over the year, I've been introduced into a few of the other random things IT 'takes care' of.\n We have 2 restaurants in the building that both use an outdated POS system. The guy who maintained the backend left a few months back, so now I'm in control of adding food buttons, prices, taxes and making sure the numbers match in the reports. (That should be a finance dept. thing)\n I'm being trained in SQL, so that I can be a backup once our programmer leaves. But I really don't care for programming. We're looking into Interns/hiring so I don't understand why we just find someone who likes SQL.\n I also have to setup most of the meetings for the execs; Which I'm not really surprised about. Just annoying as it takes me away from what I was working on especially on their 'meeting days'.\n And, I've been making the graphics for a few displays in our employee break rooms that include whatever deals we currently have for employees, position postings, inspirational posts. We have a marketing\\graphics team, but I think they don't even know about them.\n This seems to be a thing that happens in all departments though. My friend in Marketing gets the 'privilege' of driving the co-owner home when he has a fun night at the bar. Keep in mind the drive is 45 mins there and 45 back. And our AV guy has to change the movie that plays on loop in the co-owner's office whenever he calls.\n Overall it's a interesting place to work.

          "description": "We are having an issue with one of our EMR apps that connects via RDWeb. We experience intermittent connection issues between the hours of 8-10 AM in the beginning of the month or end of the month.\n I have been banging my head on the desk for months trying to figure out why this is the case.\n We have a app company that manages the app and we have an app consultant on site for a few days a week to help with any issues. I have checked the computer resources and nothing (CPU, Ethernet Task Manager tasks) even spikes when it runs or trying to connect.\n I've run wireshark scans both inside and outside the network. Outside the network it appears to connect via UDP while inside the network it appears to connect via HTTP. Outside the network there is never any problems and the loading takes much quicker.\n Issues I have encountered are slow typing within the app, having to end the RDS sessions and then connect the users again (sometimes this even chokes at first time login), and of course users not being able to login at all. This also happens on completely random computers throughout the month and NEVER at the same time. \n They can hit the RDWeb url just fine and download the RDP app just fine, and we can use all other websites/apps just fine. It's just getting in and STAYING in that is an issue.\n I'm thinking there has to be a feature that prioritizes who or how many people can continuously connect to this app at the same time or something on the network.\n I'm also thinking that it has to do with the fact that we HAVE to use HTTP instead of UDP.\n Is there anything else we can try to stabilize the connection?

The only way around this, that I'm aware off, is to set the sender in Safe (Trusted) Senders and Domains for all users\n I've done this via a PowerShell script:\n ``` Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName user@example.com \n $users = Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox \n foreach ($user in $users) {\n Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration \"$($user.UserPrincipalName)\" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add=\"mail.example.com\"} }\n ```\n I have also try to only do one user, eg. Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration \"user@example.com\" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add=\"mail.example.com\"}\n Either way I do this though, the change shows up when I look at junk settings in OWA or Outlook 365 desktop, but within 10 minutes, it's no longer in there, almost as if the change has been undone\n If I manually add the domain to my safe senders list, it remains there absolutely fine, so I don't believe this is some rogue setting or script that's clearing out the safe senders list\n    submitted by    /u/DeifniteProfessional  \n [link]   [comments]",

But as i move on to further lab scenarios, i realise there are many options not available to me.\n I have seen that there is this \"Pay As You Go\" subscription and also subscriptions such as \"Basic (Which is the free), Developer, Standard\" and as well as others such as \"P1, P2, etc\"\n As this is for self learning lab scenarios, I would just need the functions there. There wont be 1000 users using the full MS Azure suite. There will only be 1 admin and 1 test user for the scenarios.\n Can someone anyone who knows or have gone through the same situation as me advise what is the most \"basic\" subscription to be able to at least have most of the functions to complete the AZ104 course/labs scenarios.\n Thanks in advance!!\n    submitted by    /u/eplejuz  \n [link]   [comments]",

All RDS have 16 Cores and 64 GB Ram and sitting on a full flash SAN. No GPU. All virtualized on Hyper-V 2019.\n Sometimes user reporting that the server feels slow. If i go to the user and look at his problem i can confirm this problem. The monitoring of the host itself seems okay. CPU wise we are about 20 % with some peaks, but very rarely over 80 %. RAM wise also about 60 %. Disk i/o and network are not real latency. \n The problems for the users are mostly slow responding applications (not crashing) while moving the windows, latency on typing in different applications, and some other stuff. \n For a small test i removed our anti virus (Sophos) but that does not help.\n If i read some old threads here on reddit most other people have much more user per server without issues. So it does not seem an issue on the user/server ratio.\n ATM i'm thinking about buying a hardware server with an GPU to test it. Hyper-V does not really support GPU partitioning or passthrough. We tried RemoteFX last year, but that does not really work.\n So maybe some of you have some input where i can solve my performance issue on these server.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/teqqyde  \n [link]   [comments]",

Bit of background of myself, currently a helpdesk guy looking to learn networking to move into a network admin role one day. The other day my boss showed me one of our comms room with a rack of live networking equipment. The rack consisted of multiple Aruba switches/controllers and Cisco router stacked on top of each other.\n My question is how would you go about moving all this equipment to another building? Would it simply be a process of unracking all the equipment and cables --> move equipment to another building --> rerack all the equipment and plug in all the cables?\n Another question is how do you guys keep track of which cables are plugged into which device? I've seen network diagrams before but are there diagrams for which cable goes where?\n My guess would be you would need to save the running configurations on all these devices and take pictures of all the cabling.\n Is there anything else you guys would consider?\n    submitted by    /u/lolman699  \n [link]   [comments]",

Data is not encrypted on the wire.\n I have four PCs that sends some data out to the internet that I want to run through a self built TCP proxy to simulate some network conditions without running the proxy on any client.\n I was wondering if any of this is possible straight out of the switch itself via some configuration/port mirroring or if it's possible to build a proxy machine with 2 quad NICs where I could basically bridge 2 ports for data to come in and out before it gets sent to a switch on the network where I could maybe run my proxy on the to monitor and maybe alter data being sent between the NICs.\n Don't know if any of this is possible so any help would be gladly appreciated.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/ilovethecanyons  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Again, Reddit! I've come to ask for some help with a port forwarding issue I've got going on.\n My edge/gateway device is a Sonicwall TZ215 running SonicOS 6.X. I have an A record as sub.domain.tld on my public DNS that points to this device's WAN interface IP. No issues there.\n My internal host is a Proxmox host running a few web servers. I have a port forwarding rule on the Sonicwall to reach the Proxmox web UI from the internet on HTTPS/TCP port 8006. I have an SSL certificate installed on the Proxmox host for sub.domain.tld. This works perfectly.\n I am now trying to add more web servers to this subdomain on other ports, i.e. https://sub.domain.tld:8443 and http://sub.domain.tld My issue is that I get an ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED in my browser for any other port.\n My NAT configuration for the other two web servers that I'm trying to reach matches the NAT configuration for the working web server, the Proxmox host on https://sub.domain.tld:8006, except I created a service object entry for HTTPS/8443. That's the only difference. Still, I get ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED.\n I did a packet monitoring in the Sonicwall appliance to try to isolate the issue and I see the traffic is being dropped to the internal hosts using 80 and 8443, due to \"Error code 40 (Enforced firewall rule)\".\n There isn't any kind of p@cket trac3r or traffic simulator like ASA has so I'm kind of at a loss. There really aren't any other firewall policies set up since this is a really basic and new configuration, so I can't imagine there'd be anything conflicting.\n The reachable web server and the non-reachable web servers are in the same network zone as defined by the Sonicwall, so it shouldn't be an access issue either.\n I can reach the web servers both internally and on a separate network segment for VPN. \n I'm stumped, any ideas? Thanks in advance for anyone's input.\n    submitted by    /u/zfs_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not sure if all service providers do this, but I know for sure that AT&T does.

          "description": "Just thought I'd do a PSA for this in case anyone runs into this issue again. We had a request to make some NDI capable cameras work with OBS over our enterprise wireless (this particular SSID had to be created on our older Cisco 8510 due to the APs involved). The cameras themselves I believe are Mevo brand.\n After making some tweaks to get the cameras connected and accessible from the Mevo mobile app (client isolation was turned on in the WLAN config so easy fix), the next issue was that the devices were not being discovered as NDI camera sources in OBS. NDI uses mDNS but I was having issues finding the specific service string so we could add it to the mDNS snooping allow list. Ended up doing a packet capture to find it: \n _ndi._tcp.local.\n Simple enough but even searching this in Google now that I know the answer didn't bring in a lot of results so I wanted to post this and hopefully it is helpful to someone in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/Dotren  \n [link]   [comments]",

Across all of those I have one VLAN which is our AV VLAN with about 180 devices of various types of AV equipment from Teams Rooms to Dante microphones/speakers, amplifiers, control systems and Crestron NVX encoders/decoders. Everything works perfectly fine. \n I‚Äôm trying to add a new audio conferencing solution that needs to connect to some cameras using ONVIF for control. The main system sends out a discovery to the network to find any cameras. The cameras can also be manually added but then after populating the details it sends an ONVIF discovery probe to get all the details of the device. These processes don‚Äôt work at all on the AV network. If I change the addresses of these devices to any other subnet it works. \n My assumption is that there‚Äôs too much traffic flying around on that network and the messages are getting blocked somehow. I‚Äôm at a loss as to how to rectify it though. All the stacks have 10gig uplinks with no saturation, igmp snooping configured, igmp querier set to collapsed core Nexus.

This week, my main and only customer told me that they will no longer be requiring my services -- the (in)famous pink slip (or email, in this case).\n Won't get into too much detail in order to not breach the NDA, but it's one of the largest financial institutions in Europe. I was handling several DC's for them, and they decide they no longer need those DC/branch offices. They will be moving all their apps to the cloud, and all their personnel back to their HQ. They'll only have a skeleton crew at the locations which I manage, so that makes my role rather redundant. \n The reason I opened this thread is not to complain ( I'm single, no obligations, no rent, and I have several certs, including CCNP Enterprise and JNCIS-SP), but I'm curious what is the status of remote work where you're currently at ?\n This contract was 100% remote. Since I got the news this week, I think applied to some 200 jobs already, and while I found some very interesting ones which were a good fit, and which paid even better than my current contract. However all of them required either hybrid or on-site presence. \n Since the pandemic ended, what was the policy in your company in regards to remote/office hours ? And what do you think will be the future of remote work, especially for us ICT folks ? \n Also, if you happen to know anyone looking for a 100% remote based network engineer, don't hesitate to reach out to me in private.\n    submitted by    /u/WhatNot4271  \n [link]   [comments]",

No alarms or other environmental thresholds were reached. I'm trying to find some kind of event or traffic burst in my network to explain these events but it is difficult. I'm trying to think of ideas of what I could check to figure this one out.\n I changed the firmware from the older to the latest but it didn't seem to have any effect.\n ‚Äã\n I noticed some possible causality on one of my access switches connected to the router. I was migrating my router from old hardware to new and the issue of port-channel flapping moved to the new after moving this particular access switch (although I can't be sure). I noticed that port-channel for that switch has counter for \"giants\", but I'm not sure if that can have any affect on the switch itself (giants = packets that are greater than the MTU size).\n    submitted by    /u/OzschmOz  \n [link]   [comments]",

The floors are largely open - no walls, just empty space. We do not have access to the building's internet and we may (or may not) have access to normal consumer-level electricity supply.\n It just needs to be be there for a couple of weeks. 50 wifi temperature sensors will beplaced on each floor and will connect to the wifi and transmit their small amount of temperature data to a cloud service.\n I'm thinking we will likely need three 4G mobile internet routers (one per floor) and then a wifi access point (or more than one) for each floor. And possibly a UPS for each floor to supply the power to them - although hoping that electricity will be possible.\n No floor-to-floor cabling will be allowed and only minimal, exposed cabling allowed on each floor.\n So I guess my questions are chiefly:\n  \nWill one WAP per floor be able to deal with 50 low-data devices and the 80mx50m area?\n If so (or if not) what devices would you recommend\n Anything else I ought to be thinking about?\n  \nThx\n    submitted by    /u/Codga69  \n [link]   [comments]",

Before that I used to fix network issues on a basic level remotely. I was chosen because I was very interested in networking, internet and I would study at home while others wouldn't. I have learned to configure switches like Alcatel, HP, 3Com, Nortel, Dlink, Dell, Netgear on a basic level. Vlans, port isolation, loop protection, troubleshooting why it wouldn't work. We have only mikrotik dude to monitor entire network. We use only mikrotiks.What would be the best network monitoring software to monitor network for free? I can't take care of my network if I can't see what's going on in it properly. The dude only displays bandwith after 24hrs. Service up, down with notification to telegram is setup so we can react quickly. Zabbix + grafana, prometheus + grafana?How to take care of network properly? What to monitor? What are free gpon monitoring tools? Zabbix seem to increase cpu load of gpon. I have basic understanding but I want to get better and take care of my network. I have to take care of a few data rooms, switches, security, I need to see what's going on my network in switches, gpon, I want to get better at this. I was working for free to get any experience previously just to get hired somewhere. I found my favorite thing. Networking. When I like this, I have motivation. Could you help me? I need good material how to take care of network properly. Thanks. I'm not alone there's a Senior Network Admin that takes care of servers, the work load is huge, when to learn? :) I want to help him. I'll put less stress on him by taking care of my side of network.

Is this something on their end, or does this refer to our own hardware?

There is a second ISP that connects to the HA firewalls and the equipment from that ISP has multiple ports for WAN and a WAN switch isn't needed on the second ISP link.\n It is a 24 port switch and I plan on using interfaces 1-12 for the WAN VLAN (to avoid using VLAN 1 and all 24 ports). I've already added the WAN VLAN and added those ports to that VLAN.\n The mgmt interface will be used for local access/configuration.\n Here are my questions (so far).\n  \nI'm going to confirm LLDP isn't active on ports 1-12.\n I'd like to configure SNMP to only send data to my internal SNMP server. I've seen switches/network devices that have fields/commands to send SNMP data to specific servers, but I've also left those fields blank and I can still log into my NMS and pull SNMP data from the switch given I have the correct information.\n  \nI'm currently reading through the 3900 manual to confirm the LLDP and SNMP commands, but I wanted to see if anyone here had any other suggestions that I may be missing to avoid leaking out data/information that should be avoided on the WAN side.\n Traditionally we've never done anything fancy to WAN switches, they are just L2 switches that we throw into the mix and we've also never had any management other than a local console cable IF a change needed to be made. Going forward, I'd like to change this and given that I have a local network port for management, I'd like to secure this switch the best way that I can.\n The default credentials have already been changed.\n Thanks.\n Edit- In other switches I've used, the management port is usually listed as out of band. I haven't found that to be the case for this 3900 switch.\n    submitted by    /u/tdhuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the L3 switch I've issued the static route command and set next hop as the Juniper interface that connects to the L3 switch.\n I added a static route in on the Juniper also, with next hop as L3 switch interface. However, when trying to ping from the Juniper network into the L3 network, my gateway comes back with destination net unreachable. In fact, when I logon to the Juniper over SSH, and try pinging the L3 switch interface, I get \"no route to host\" and when I look at the Juniper routing table, I see an entry for the L3 switch interface listed as a \"rejected\".\n I read somewhere that you can't simply add a static route onto a non point-to-point link on a Juniper. If that is the case, can someone explain how I can configure a basic static route on here?\n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/No_Barracuda_3615  \n [link]   [comments]",

My router that is redistributing BGP -> OSPF would be considered an ASBR.

I have a Layer 3 core switch which is connected to an ASA and all of the VLANs are configured on the core switch. I implemented the design this weekend and am having trouble with the connections from the new VLANs to the pre-existing network.\n My configuration is as follows:\n ASA\n int g1/1 - Outside\n int g1/2 - Inside - 192.168.1.1 (Connected to Core Switch)\n route inside 192.168.101.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2\n route inside 192.168.102.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2\n route from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.2 is directly connected via g1/2 \n Core Switch\n vtp mode server\n int g1/0/1 (Connected to ASA)\n switchport access to vlan 10\n int vlan 10\n ip add 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0\n ip helper-address 192.168.1.30\n int vlan 80\n ip add 192.168.101.1 255.255.255.0\n ip helper-address 192.168.1.30\n int vlan 90\n ip add 192.168.102.1 255.255.255.0\n ip helper-address 192.168.1.30 \n ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 \n ip routing is enabled \n So here's what I've found so far:\n I can ping from 192.168.1.x to any other VLAN\n I can't ping the other way around\n DHCP is working. I'm able to receive all DHCP information and can reach the internet.\n I can ping all SVIs and ASA from 192.168.101.x\n I can't ping between 192.168.101.x and 192.168.102.x networks \n There are ACLs applied to the inside interface on the ASA, but they appear to permit all icmp traffic and all ip traffic.\n I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this exact issue as searching on Google has been no help. I mostly get results with configurations that involve using the ASA for Inter-VLAN networking, using sub-interfaces and whatnot. I am strictly trying to setup Inter-VLAN networking on the L3 switch. Any help would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/gigapet  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am trying to set up a complex system using a cisco nexus with full routing enabled. I need to have two VRFs set up for regulations requirements. I need to get 4 networks on the switch run through 2 vrfs out two physical interfaces up to the firewall where Policy can handle it and let things go out to the internet. I am having trouble actually configuring it.\n The basic set up is kind of like this: \n VR-Office\n vlan 12\n 10.10.12.0/22\n 10.10.12.1 gateway \n vlan 16\n 10.10.16.0/24\n 10.10.16.1 gateway\n int eth1/1 ip add 172.16.16.129 #the far end will have an add of 16.130 \n VR-Accounting\n vlan 112\n 10.20.12.0/22\n 10.20.12.1 gateway \n vlan116\n 10.20.16.0/24\n 10.20.16.1 gateway\n int eth1/2 ip add 172.16.16.133 #other side will have address 16.134 \n I need the two vlans to have an svi per vlan that I can add to the associated VRFs. Then I need to route to physical interfaces associated to the vrfs.\n The way I logically manage it in my head I imagine that the office vrf has two SVIs, one per vlan, with each having the IP address of the vlans gateway. Then the office vrf also has the physical interface. \n I want to make sure that the vlans 12 and 16 are only routing on vrf vr-office and can be routed our eth1/1 to get out. \n Am I misunderstanding anything? Would anyone be willing to explain how this might look in a L2/L3 router's config? I feel like I am missing something simple.\n    submitted by    /u/mustang23200  \n [link]   [comments]",

TLS certificates require domain names to work so DNS over TLS only works if you provide a hostname instead of an IP address, but if the device is connecting to a network for the first time and the DHCP server only provides the hostnames for the DNS servers then how is the device going to resolve the hostname to connect to the DNS server in the first place? Also, what if I'm connected to a single DNS server that supports DoT and the cached IP address disappears or something? How are these situations handled? And if you just cannot resolve any query then are you supposed to provide the IP address of the server as a fallback option?

So vlan default = vlan 1. Wouldn't each interface act the same with anything on vlan 1?\n The change I am making is swapping po1 and 2 vlans. So I don't know why when I move po1 (which owns the default, or vlan1 traffic) to po2, traffic stops flowing.

We peer with Lumens AS3356 and we peer with AltaFibers primary AS as well. \n The problem is that we peer with one of Spectrums regional ASs, 10796, vs their 'backbone' Charter AS7483. In this case, many would be preferred routes are now an additional AS away. \n Is it possible to strip AS10796 out of the routes which also have AS7483 so that I can install them with one less AS in the path?

Mostly for smaller scale government networks. I've made it to the final round of interviews for a position as an MPLS engineer.\n I feel confident about some of the things they want, like L2 switching, L3 routing, OSPF/BGP and Cisco familiarity. The problem is that I haven't touched MPLS professionally in a while, and when I did it was on the customer end. The company I'm interviewing with is a provider. Aside from a core understanding of MPLS, I've also been told they're going to want to talk about: Segment Routing, Pseudowire, VRF, VPRN, VPLS, EVPN, 1588, and TWAMP. They've also mentioned the ISIS routing protocol which I'm not too familiar with.\n I understand the theory of MPLS and I've been individually researching these other topics. I was wondering if you guys know any solid video series, courses/labs, or books that would cover most or all of these things under the MPLS umbrella. The interview is next week so my aim is not to sound like a complete clown when I talk about MPLS. Any advice appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/HaleMorne  \n [link]   [comments]",

We then used RSPAN get all traffic from all of the lower switches up to SW1 for the local SPAN. Currently SW6 and SW7 have remote VLAN 111 going to SW3. But once we try forwarding SW3 to SW1 using VLAN 111 it creates a loop and sends a copy back to SW6 and SW7 since the trunk allows the VLAN both ways.\n Any solutions to this issue?\n We are thinking of having RSPAN on SW4, 5, 6 and 7 use VLAN 111 and then configure RSPAN on SW2 and 3 to use VLAN 112 so that way the traffic is only able to go one direction.

          "description": "Hello, I am currently developing a multiplayer video game that will be using UDP P2P and I wish to use hole/nat punching to solve the issue with users not having to configure their router ports and/or network settings.\n I've managed to set up a system with a middle hand server that introduces users to each other (I believe it is called a STUN server?). Each user connects to this and a user (client) can request to be matched with another user (host). If a suitable host is found, the host is notified of the client and vice versa, they then start punching each other. This setup seems to work as intended, for most cases at least...\n The problem I am facing is in the case that the hosting user is on a non-public ip adress. The \"handshake\" via hole punching does not seem to get confirmed and the connection fails.\n Is there some kind of way to solve this issue? A relay server is not really part of the plan as it includes additional latency and costs.\n ‚Äã\n Edit: or could this issue not be related to the IP being private and instead be a router issue?\n    submitted by    /u/Fapstep  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only commonality between these ports are that they all have a USB-C style docking station attached to them with a laptop. Port-security is helping stop the mac-addresses from overloading, but I'm curious if anyone has ever ran into something like this?

          "description": "Hi, does the notes I've made below (along with the one question too) sound about right when describing active vs passive authentication? Let's assume the firewall I mentioned to is a Firepower device too (not that it would matter anyway)\n Active authentication actively prompts the user to sign in before they try and access a website and then after that it will go through the access policy to see if that user account matches any rules for that username for them to be able to access a particular website. You can specify what managed device (computer/vm) you want the user to see this authentication prompt on when they try and access the internet. When it says authentication method is HTTP basic, what does that mean? Does it mean that the device (firewall) will open a port 80 connection with the domain controller to check to see if the users entreded creds are correct and then authenticate the user? \n Passive authentication won't prompt the user when they're on a device and will instead check ISE (which is acting as the user agent) to tell ISE to go and check AD for the ip to user and group mappings for the account that is presented to ISE and then retrieves that info from the DC's and builds the connection logs out also uses that information to then go through the access policies and check to see if any rules are hit too \n These 2 authentication methods only work with 80/443 traffic\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

On core 1 I have configured SVI for each VLAN. I want a second core switch (Core 2) to be able to take/distribute load while acting like a backup switch if Core1 goes down. Each access switch should have a redundant link to both Core1 and Core2.

And it has no problem in returning Ruckus VSA 142 that should contain a modified version of each PSK. The problem is in storing the PSKs.\n As per the Ruckus docoumentation for the DPSK format, Clearpass would have to be able to use one of the SHA1 key derivation functions and then store a byte array based on a combination of the SSID and the PSK. Let's assume the PSK is admin-assigned, not generated for each client by Clearpass. The natural place to store a DPSK would be a custom dictionary attribute in the Endpoints repository, however, these do not support byte arrays, nor do they provide any access to basic functions. In this case the required function is definitely available to the underlying system as Clearpass uses it for hashing admin user passwords. In any case since the DPSK format is zero-padded a string field cannot be used instead.\n Anyway, I figured it worth asking if anyone had found a solution.\n    submitted by    /u/perryurban  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was hoping someone may know? I tried doing Ctrl + F on ifIndex, IP, Mac Address and VLAN but couldn't find the corrolation.\n 2) Which OID should I use if I run this across chassis based switches aswell?

I have a Palo alto 450 connected to a Cisco 9200.\n Historically our core has been connected to a firewall via a Layer 3 connection with an IP address. 172.16.0.1(firewall) > 172.16.0.2 (Core). There are static routes on both devices that list those IPs as the next hops. \n I'm trying to get the VLAN information and routing up to the firewall, and in order to do that I need to make a trunk connection rather than an access connection. But trunk connections don't have layer 3 IP addresses, so if I convert my access connection to trunk, I'll lose my IP addresses.

The product focuses on analysing the client's private security cameras, so the idea is that the client simply puts the IP of the camera and my product starts picking up the feed. In these situations most of clients have their cameras in a private network and so just by having the IP won't do any good. What would the simplest way for the client to allow my product to have access to that private network so it can access the camera feed ? \n Thanks in advance ?\n    submitted by    /u/Deeks0  \n [link]   [comments]",

Have multiple zones, that my predecessor installed where apparently one new AP can do the coverage of two old APs. Laptops and mobile work stations do fine with roaming and connectivity. Using Ascom i63 phones with Ruckus R730s, SmartZone as the controller. Phones are on 5Ghz band. Phones register with the pbx. User complaints are poor roaming and \"ghost calls\" where the phones will ring to a bridged extension but I assume packets arrive late due to high latency (they rarely go over 50ms on the AP) and the phone rings but caller not on the other end.\n Followed the interrop report from Ruckus/Ascom to set up the WLAN. The client settings and WLAN are exactly like the interop report. Doing wireshark traces does not reveal the problem. Did several Ascom log traces and when I caught the problem, notify Ascom and apparenly we do not have some super duper special docking station which allows me to view the log file. Absolutely livid about that. Getting no real help from Ascom other than they want more Omnipeek traces. \n I have been concentrating on one zone at a time. I got them to work better in two zones just by moving the APs further away from each other or deleting one or two. I do my own Netspot surveys and do not find coverage to be the issue.

I have multiple wireless controllers so I need graphs on total number of users (per SSID).\n Other graphs and alarms on WiFi-related problems.\n This is in addition to monitoring a multivendor switched and SD-WAN network. \n Which product would you recommend me? It is ok if it costs money.\n    submitted by    /u/rocktanstone  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Everyone,\n Quick question, hopefully someone can assist, this is the first time I have properly configured STP rather than set the defaults and run, and I am not 100% sure if I should even have it enabled over the MC-LAG links for the Juniper Top of Rack or leaf switch stack.\n The link below is an example of the network layout I am configuring.\n https://imgur.com/a/B5bAy5J\n Should I disable RSTP and VSTP on the Juniper, on the MC-LAG interface to the core switch? Currently it is set up with RSTP, the MC-LAG interfaces are set to point to point and other interfaces are edge, the ICL between the stack has RSTP disabled, and it's set block BPDU on edge.\n The Cisco portion of the network has Rapid-PVST+, the core is the root bridge, the others are default, access ports are portfast, etc. basic Cisco set up really.\n I am not sure if I should disable all STP on the MC-LAG interfaces to the core and management switch, the MC-LAG stack is an aggregate switch stack, should it just pass through the BPDU packets? I believe this is what the Juniper documentation is getting at but it's a little wishy washy on that. This would basically leave Cisco to run STP on its network, and just leave the rack alone. Or do I pass through the packets and enable Rapid-PVST+ on the management switch, on the other side of the Juniper MC-LAG?\n Or should I also be setting up the Juniper MC-LAG stack to be handling the incoming BPDU packets from the Cisco? I would have to add PVST to it as well for interoperability, I am just not sure how this may affect the RSTP running locally, which was recommended to be enabled by Junipers docs.\n Any help would be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/misterezekiel  \n [link]   [comments]",

These devices essentially all rely on multicasting, IGMP, and are in the realm of 10Gb to 25Gb per device/host. One issue that i've seen frequently in some courses panels in regards to switch stacking, is that by stacking switches you can quickly run into severe multicast flooding. Arista deals with this through what they call \"Multi-cast Orchestration\" on their own switches, and Netgear acknowledges it's an issue and says \"Care should be taken\" when stacking switches- however I haven't heard anyone mention how to actually prevent or stop that multicast flooding on a network without something like Arista's proprietary product. Is there a common approach to handling this I'm not aware of or some 3rd party product which can handle this? What is the \"care\" you would even take to prevent that form of multicast flooding? \n The reason for the stacked switches is to achieve 100% redundancy, allow easier expandability, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/Not-Satan-But-Close  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each frequency has its own wavelength that it transmits off, the higher the frequency goes up, the more \"aggressive\" the wavelength, allowing for faster speeds again in combination with QAM etc... the lower end wireless frequencies (2.4ghz) have a \"wider\" wavelength, allowing for radio waves to travel further, at greatly reduced speeds and more i‚Ä¶",

The Atoms almost always fail and require a power cycle or a complete factory reset before the update can succeed. The AP250s exhibit the same behavior, but not as often. Sometimes I do have to deactivate PoE on their backhaul ports to get them to eventually behave.\n Every AP is backhauled btw, no mesh. \n To troubleshoot, I've consoled into a couple while this process happens, but the logs I see give no clear indication of why updates could have failed besides some vague messages about losing connectivity to the cloud.. but they're rebooting and won't have connectivity to anything. The cloud console gives no information whatsoever after a failure. In the device list, the ones that eventually fail get stuck at 12% on the progress bar... for HOURS.\n These are all legacy Aerohive devices by the way. We had these before AH was acquired by Extreme. Are we running into some kind of planned deprecation situation? The thing that bothers me is even when we were running Aerohive's Mangler, this stuff still happened, but not as bad and way less frequent.\n Is extreme/aerohive's cloud management just this bad? Or is there something wrong with how these are deployed/operating? These things are workhorses. And after tuning the hell out of the system due to a high-density/high-interference environment, users have been happy. I'm actually very impressed with the flexibility and features these things provide.

Now they decided to buy the property across the street and covert it to another 5 rooms for the hotel. They want internet and IP cameras across the street. The \"street\" is unpaved, and the other property is 84 feet from the office where I keep the modem and router. I'm leaning toward using Cat 6 or fiber to span this distance. My business partner wants to use a Ubiquity air max bridge. I haven't set one of these up, so I don't know how reliable or complicated they are. Theres no vegetation in the line of sight, but it rains a lot. Currently I use a Huwei LTE modem/router with 3 Unifi AP's. I think I am going to add a load balancing router so I can use two ISPs for more consistency and speed. \n The owner said we could bury a conduit if we want. Also I could hypothetically use the utility poles to span cable (is that a good idea)? I want something thats going to work 99% of the time.

For history, most of my professional career has been in enduser support. Recently a colleague of mine left and encouraged me to apply for his old position as a network specialist.\n I took the time to relearn what i could and played in a simulated environment and did i ever learn the hard way how different real hardware vs simulation can be. Anyhow, to the question. During the interview we had to complete a skills test that was set up in a collapsed core configuration:\n Cisco catalyst 9500 as the core/distribution switch and a Cisco Catalyst 9300 as the access. One of the Objectives was to set up an etherchannel link between the distribution and access layer switches and using port channel 1 as the container. The directions were vague so I assumed they'd leave it up to the interviewee to choose PAgP or LACP so i opted to set each side to channel group mode on. When I tried to apply the configuration both the 9500 and 9300 spit out \"command rejected\" I forget the exact verbage. In the end, I ended setting the distribution switch to channel group mode active and the access switch to passive and the etherchannel relationship formed. My I'm just scratching my head as to why mode on was rejected.\n EDIT: fixed some grammar and verbage\n    submitted by    /u/Mechin17  \n [link]   [comments]",

We maintain an alias in our firewall for customer IP addresses\n \nBackup files are encrypted with a 2048bit key as they are generated at the customer site. They cannot be read without this key\n \nThe connection itself is TLS from the customer server to the backup appliance\n \nThe backup client at the customer sites must have a seperate 2048bit key in order to connect and have Read/Write access to the backup appliance\n \nThe backup appliance is off domain and uses a separate set of credentials from anything else\n \n  \nHere is the debate.\n A coworker is pretty insistent that we should be running these connections over a VPN of some sort. Either OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IPSec maybe. I have countered that since the backups themselves are encrypted AND are being sent over TLS, this is not necessary and would harm performance.\n What do you think?

Nothing new is in production yet, we're still in the planning phase, and we're trying to figure out how difficult this will be (we're in a manufacturing environment where some sites work 3 shifts and almost never shut down).\n According to this compatibility matrix, it should work. Here's a screenshot of the relevant section.\n I've got one of the 9800s online and I've got a spare 2702 AP that I'm testing with.

(Side note: I really hope we end up giving Japan 11 as their BGP community code as a *tips fedora* to Code Geass).\n I'll admit this is not fully thought through yet and I wanted to open up the discussion to the networking community to hear their thoughts. The first issue I can forsee is AS' that strip BGP communities. In my head this International BGP community standard would be most useful in IXs.\n TLDR; If you operate an ASN can you advertise your prefixes with a BGP community that will identify the Country:/State/Province/Region/etc? An International BGP community codes standard for the BGP communities would be great.\n    submitted by    /u/Ozot-Gaming-Internet  \n [link]   [comments]",

The remote site is on a cable internet circuit. At all my sites, including the remote site, 802.1X with EAP-TLS is used for both wireless and wired auth. This has been working great for months, until my ISP changed which backbone on their network my DIA connection runs across. No other changes were made anywhere other than the provider's backbone that's delivering the DIA circuit.\n The IP address of the SRX in the DC didn't change and the tunnel is still up and working. I can't find any evidence of issues with the tunnel, except .1X doesn't work anymore. On the NPS servers in the DC, event viewer shows that auth requests are coming in from the switch and AP at the remote site, but it almost seems like the .1X requests are getting mangled across the site-to-site tunnel. The same NPS servers service .1X for hardwired and wireless clients across several other sites connected via the ISP's MPLS without issue.\n Event viewer shows that auth requests from the AP at the remote site get logged as event id 6274 \"The RADIUS Request message that Network Policy Server received from the network access server was malformed.\" Auth requests from hardwired ports from the remote switch show that rather than the computer name with a certificate, the request shows the client trying to auth with its mac address as the username and PAP and summarily denied.\n A tech at the ISP that made the backbone change and I have been beating our heads against the wall for a few days now with no progress. I've resorted to installing wireshark on the NPS server to try to find differences between known-good auth packets and broken packets, but haven't found an obvious difference yet.

I am not able to get to my firewall from one of my VLANS.\n ‚Äã\n My test environment is like this\n ‚Äã\n ‚Äã\n Switch 1 (core switch) 192.168.0.10\n Switch 2 (access switch) 192.168.0.11\n Switch 3 (access switch) 192.168.0.12\n Firewall 192.168.0.6\n ‚Äã\n PC1 192.168.0.100\n PC2 192.168.0.110\n PC3 192.168.3.110\n ‚Äã\n I can ping everything from both PC1, PC2 and the Core switch. \n I can ping both PC1 and PC2 and the core switch from PC3, however, I cannot ping both access switches and the firewall from PC3.\n ‚Äã\n I have an SVI configured with the IP address 192.168.3.1 on VLAN 30 on my Core switch. \n I have a computer plugged directly into port 4 on the Core switch, but I cannot ping firewall. \n ‚Äã\n I have been reading article after article and I know I have to be missing something stupid here. \n ‚Äã\n I thought maybe it was because I didn't have layer 3 enabled, so as a test, I even configured port 4 with the IP address 192.168.3.1 and enabled routing, but I still get the exact same results.\n ‚Äã\n I have a static route setup for 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 to forward traffic to 192.168.0.6 (firewall).\n I am able to get out to the internet from both PC1 and PC2 just fine, just not PC3.\n ‚Äã\n Furthermore, if I log into my switches web portal, I can switch to VLAN30 and I can ping out directly from the switch, but I still cannot ping either access switch or the firewall from the Core switch on VLAN30\n ‚Äã\n ‚Äã\n Any help would be so very gratefully appreciated. \n Thank you so much in advance!\n Edit: Solved!\n    submitted by    /u/six6sickx  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some sites even have various other types of encryption. From my understanding, typically the site rtr does NOT have MPLS config, though we still have MPLS qos config on each site rtr, along with the hub having MPLS qos config. Our hub feeds into another MPLS network we own - after collectors - so I‚Äôd presume, if the marking is kept, that it could be used for our campus MPLS qos (I think that‚Äôs the teams thought here). However, peeling back the onion, it was revealed to me by AT&T, that each site doesnt necessarily have a COS profile ordered with them , which would explain some of the asymmetrical issues seen while traffic went through AVPN - maybe. My question is, if we are hopping around at layer 3 already, would MPLS markings still be seen or matter by AT&Ts underlay somewhere? Even with just the basic GRE traffic, I‚Äôd figure that qos markings would be copied over maintained? Right now, I think the profile not being set as being the problem / waste.\n At a higher level to this, it seems like there‚Äôs a possibility that whoever architected the design so that we control L3, traded off the QoS perk gained from MPLS.

          "description": "Hey all. Happy after valentines day. I've got a problem eating at me. And yes I realize I should leave the shit at work. But. \n I have engagement (tehe) with a vendor on a project recently. They provide SaaS for my company. We are trying to stand up a new site to site. Problem is we don't see the tunnel (policy based) come up. My next steps were to do an embedded pcap as I am not seeing any traffic from the host at the firewall. I send an email to the vendor saying I see no traffic each time we test... but then after I explicitly point at the host in one of my emails we see an icmp request come across the fw about an hour later. Following I get an email from their pm asking me to explain steps I see in the network and they are requesting an additional resource to look at our network. \n Now the question. And don't get me wrong, this is indeed ego related, but my ego isnt that big (is it?). \n Previously when setting up the site to site, I worked with a respectable sounding network engineer. Would it be wrong to reach out to him and ask him what the hell? (Respectfully.) The problem is that the traffic never leaves the host. We have routes out and they proved it via ping. \n TLDR: I want to hear about times that you all took back alleys to get things accomplished. Or do we all just play the follow along and provide pcap when requested?\n    submitted by    /u/Stillbleedblue  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every day around the same time, one of our sites' (public high school) bandwidth drops to nothing for about 15 minutes. I ran iperf tests on repeat and logged the output across the WAN to the site and I was getting around 1.8Gbits/s on a 2Gbits/s connection. Right around the time the students leave the bandwidth tanked in iperf (just across the WAN to the DC) and on speedtest.net to 30Mbits/s for between 5 and 15 minutes. Seems to happen each day around that time and then just clears up.\n I have smokeping running and that looks clean and never shows a change. I don't drop regular ping packets but if I run a faster fping I do see between 1%-4% packet loss around that time. Interfaces on my router are clear. Nothing in the logs of the routers on either side. Something tells me it's the WAN provider but I am out of ideas on what to test or how to prove the issue further. I plan on reaching out to them tomorrow to see if they can seen anything on their side but I know that will be tough to get them to research it.

          "description": "Hi all,\n I'm in the process of replacing the firewalls at our main site as well as our DR site and had a question as to what the best way to setup SSL VPN connections for our users would be. The current setup is non-existent in that my predecessor never did any SSL VPN config on the DR firewall (I don't know how they thought that was going to work in a disaster).\n Each site is going to have a pair of Palo Alto 3410s in active/passive HA. I'd like to try to avoid having to setup each user with 2 different SSL VPN configs (one for normal use and one for DR use) and the only way of doing this that comes to mind immediately would be for me to have a virtual firewall in the cloud that I use to terminate all of the client SSL VPN connections to and then have a site to site VPN between that firewall and both the production site and the DR site. With that setup, in a DR scenario I wouldn't have to touch the SSL VPN config, just route the traffic from the virtual firewall to the DR site rather than the main site. Obviously this would require extra licensing for the virtual firewall and increases complexity but I'm thinking it might be worth it to not have to setup every user with multiple SSL VPN configs and explain to them to use the DR one in a DR scenario.\n I don't have much experience with SSL VPN configs on Palo Alto firewalls yet, so if there is an easier or more efficient way to achieve this please feel free to suggest.

One vendor, all networks, don't have to pay attention to where we ship it. Ideally it lets us also choose whatever carrier has best signal instead of being locked to the carrier we bought the sim from.\n I was looking at Twiliio, and the platform is just super cool, but we're not large enough for them to be interested in giving us a better rate. So I'm looking around for other choices. If twilio is the only choice then I'll hold my nose and pay, but it's worth asking what else there is. \n Let's figure a burn of around 15MB/day so around 500MB/unit/mo. Not huge, not zero. Bogey being here occasionally we may want to use it for backup IP for the site, in which case we'll be burning 10s of GBs. But maybe that's ok in the case since it will be an emergency.

Assume that all switches have 48 access ports and support Jumbo frames. Some servers and clients are connected to these access switches in a random way. \n Okay, now I want to enable Jumbo frames on my network because some (only some!) servers require this. I did it on all ports between network equipment, so there is no MTU mismatch on the network core. Now, let's say I enabled Jumbo frames support on some access ports and on the servers connected to these ports. So we have:\n  \nJumbo frames are enabled on all links between network devices.\n Jumbo frames are enabled on some access ports and on the servers connected to these ports.\n All other access ports and devices connected to these ports have default MTU.\n \n My questions are:\n  \nWhat will happen if a client with default MTU sends some data to a server with 9000+ MTU if:\n Client and Server are in the same L2 segment?\n What will happen if the server with 9000+ MTU sends some data to the client with 1500 MTU if:\n Client and Server are in the same L2 segment?\n What will happen if a client with default MTU sends some data to the server with 9000+ MTU if: Client and Server are in the different subnets?\n What will happen if the server with 9000+ MTU sends some data to the client with 1500 MTU if:\n Client and Server are in the different subnets?\n  \nThanks.\n    submitted by    /u/istonru  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have the above Nexus layer 3 switch with a 1G ethernet transceiver and a CATx cable around 20m length plugged to an HP laptop also with an onboard ethernet port, auto-speed/duplex at both ends. The problem is that despite both ends being logically active, the link reports as not connected, when both ends are then physically connected. Bring down and bring back up the port on the Laptop (Windows Networking disable/enable) everything springs into life. Same symptoms observed plugging into another network device, although in that case, no option exists to manually down/up the interface (cheap IP cam) Plug the same devices and the cable into another switch, different brand but same logical configuration - it all comes up first time. So to me it's not the cable, and points to something on the Nexus. Nexus port config however is a really simple one;\n Interface eth1/27 switchport switchport access vlan 3 no shutdown \n Has anybody seen this before, or could offer some clues on further diagnostic actions please?\n Ps already tried to post this in r/cisconetworking but apparently one has to be a trusted member..\n    submitted by    /u/firsway  \n [link]   [comments]",

Reliability, affordability, and ease of maintenance are the three top priorities (in that order) for this project. It will be really hard to service the APs and routers hooked up to the local fiber network that will be provided by a telco.\n The idea is to set up \"smart\" poles that will be used to mount the APs as well as all of the grounding equipment etc.\n Thanks again for any and all advice -- we will most likely need to contract this out but I wanted to check with this sub first just to get a general idea of min/max including projected costs.\n    submitted by    /u/sksksjhdjajss  \n [link]   [comments]",

The current method of listening to these devices is to connect them all to a large hub and listen on whichever computer I‚Äôm using to record the data. Processing is done as data arrives, etc. This is manageable, but undesirable for a couple reasons:\n  \nOnly one PC can listen at a time\n \nTo reduce bandwidth cost, the devices do not report human-readable data. Rather, the host is responsible for deserializing/parsing the data as it‚Äôs streamed though\n \n Solution: Have a single server computer dedicated to listening to the serial streams, parsing, then passing the stream to clients around the network in a more desirable format. Extending this, I suppose there could be multiple ‚Äúsub‚Äù servers forwarding to a main server which distributes to whoever is listening, but I‚Äôm not going to bother with that at the moment. \n My question(s) to you: \n  \nIs this worth pursuing? At its core, all I‚Äôm doing is forwarding usb bits to the network and moving the parsing work to a different computer. At the moment, a single computer solution is working just fine, if annoying. \n \nHas anyone done anything like this? \n \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/SquiDoge  \n [link]   [comments]",

Shaw called me last month and said our router is pulling too many IPs (~500) when we are only assigned 5. Nothing has changed in our configuration that would have caused this - I have literally not touched this client's network in over a year.\n So, checking their settings from the ISP, looks like:\n WAN IP: 1.2.3.200\n Subnet: 255.255.254.0\n Gateway: 1.2.3.1\n We are assigned the static IPs .200-.204\n Right off the bat, I'm thinking - there are your 500 IPs, its just getting everything on the subnet they gave me. Due to the gateway address, I can't make it smaller than 255.255.255.0. When I make that change, guess what? Now there's only 200-something IPs being pulled. They swear the original settings are correct.\n When I look in the SonicWall logs, I see lots of \"failed TCP packets\" from some China IP with a destination of another IP on the subnet that is not in our block of static IPs (lets say it is 1.2.3.50). Is there something configured in the SonicWall that is doing this?\n I told Shaw that their equipment should be restricting the IPs to whatever they give us, and its not my fault/problem. They came and replaced their modem today and it still has the same problem - pulling way too many IPs. Their next step is they want me to factory reset the SonicWall and set it up from scratch - no way am I doing that!\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/RainyNetAdmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is what I'm having a hard time deciding: \n I am looking at either Cisco C1000 or Aruba CX6000 48 and 24 port PoE switches. Supply chain is like everything else right now and lackluster at best. They are also getting pretty expensive. \n I can find \"previously loved\"/refurb Aruba 2530 or Cisco 3750X 48 and 24 port PoE switches that support our requirements for about 1/5 to 1/3 of the cost from a reputable supplier. Cisco 3750X is out of support and the 2530 will be soon, so no critical vulnerability patches when/if they happen. \n Our perimeter will be secured with either Fortigate or Palo Alto and proper segmented network design, and these switches will sit only on the access layer. \n What I'm struggling with is justifying the HUGE jump in price to go brand new. Yes, I realize it could prevent a potential failure, but these are also Cisco and Aruba switches that will most likely last 10-15 years without issue which has been my experience with both brands. If one fails, I can stock 3 in its place and still come out ahead. \n Curious what the consensus is on missing out on vulnerability patches on switches that are at the access layer?

I'm self-taught in SQL and Server admin, and the guy that had previously setup the network I'm working on is out on medical leave (not expected back before go-live). \n We're a small company, that recently decided to open a second location several states away from our current. Our current network is a 10.10.x/23 setup, with 1-79 reserved for static devices (servers, switches, printers, network connected manufacturing devices), and the rest as DHCP for internal and guest networks. We're very close to our 512 address limit. Our new location is expected to roughly need 20 more static addresses, and peak around 100 DHCP between internal and guest. My initial thought was to use the same DHCP host, expand the subnet to a 10.10.x/21, block of a larger range for statics, and expand DHCP range for the rest. \n However, I get the impression that I can create the 2nd location network as it's own 10.10.x/24 range, and use DHCP Relay to enable communication without having to rework all of the local stuff. That should just require some changes to the initial DHCP, and DNS, but otherwise will all be configurable on the Firewall at location2?\n ‚Äã\n So in things needing adjusted in Loc1 (ex. 10.10.100/23)\n -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)\n -DHCP Host\n -DNS Host\n -rest of the network is no-change\n Loc2 (ex 10.10.200/23)\n -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)\n -rest of the network is nothing extra to setup\n ‚Äã\n Is this best practice?

We do have a firewall in between, and although these two are in the same subnet (should just be switched) we see it hitting (the L3 gateways are configured on the firewall, so this might be expected). \n What's more interesting, is I would think the LB should receive the reset and stop the data. It keeps sending, for a few seconds after the server had (suppposedly) reset the connection. \n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/n0treallyanengineer  \n [link]   [comments]",

This endpoint is restricted in the firewall to a known Allowlist of customer FQDN and IP addresses. \n Orders from a particular customer stopped flowing this week. We reached out to the customer Tech Support for assistance, no response. After a backlog of about $200,000 worth of purchase orders had stacked up, I dug in.\n I knew that the customer's app was trying to make a connection and assumed they were hitting us from an unknown and disallowed IP address. Using Packet Capture and wireshark, I was able to sift though all of the Scans, bots, and other nasty traffic and ended up correlating inbound dropped packets to outbound confirmation requests (from other TCP streams initiated by us). The source and destination IPs were different, but both in Google Cloud.\n I took an educated guess and whitelisted an unknown IP Address and the orders started flowing again.\n Turns out the customer had migrated their services to Google Cloud and had not informed their downstream vendors of the change. \n I love this detective work, using wireshark to solve these kinds of mysteries and investigating what is otherwise \"invisible\".\n I'm a generalist - a mile wide and an inch deep but have recently developed a strong desire to specialize in networking or Cyber.

Before performing the upgrade we forgot to disable the NAT rules on the Fortigate which were running parallel with Palo Alto firewalls. \n During the upgrade firewalls failed over and the ARP table on our ISP gateway got updated with new ARP entries from Fortigate (GARP sent during HA failover). And users lost access to some of the servers NAT'ed on outside. Since we don't have access to the ISP gateway to clear ARP cache, we needed to contact the ISP support, unfortunately no one responded in a timely manner.\n So the situation is that we need to wait till the arp timer expires in the ISP gateway and we don't know how long it takes and we cannot afford a long outage. So we had to fix this issue asap without performing a failover or any changes in Palo Alto to trigger GARP. \n Then we found this command  test arp gratuitous ip <ip/netmask> interface <interface name>  which would manually trigger a GARP and it saved our day. It updated the upstream ISP gateway ARP tables. I know that we could do this in Cisco ASA and Firepower but wasn't aware that this is available in Palo.

I run LACP on two ports, port 1 and port 2.\n Two NK9 switches are vPC pairs.\n The switches are pure layer 2, we run only layer 2 on the switches (only L2 VLANs). All the default gateways are configured in the firewalls.\n Internet terminated in the switches. I do NOT have two ISPs, it is only one ISP that provides us two circuits or two handoffs that terminates on my both switches. They (the ISP) run VRRP on the router so my internet next-hop or default gateway is the VIP. Basically, the internet connection (setup) is a QinQ where they handoff two transport VLANs.\n  \nThe MLAG‚Ä¶",

Our solar network needs to communicate to 192.168.0.100 to get data from their existing electrical infrastructure. Their 192.168.0.100 is not connected to the internet due to security reasons, it's literally got an unmnaged switch with no router even, we are allowed though to connect onto that network as long as their computer doesn't have any internet access. Secondly, we've got a TV in the entrance of the building displaying data from the solar for the clients to see, it's almost a 800m run so would rather want to utilise and try to work through their existing network, running a new cable is very hard due to access.\n I please need assistance on how to get traffic from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.5 without interfering with their existing network (not sure if it's called port forwarding?). Client has a network engineer on site but I'm getting the feeling he's not 100% sure how as nothing has been actioned yet, I can hopefully relay info from here to him and see if he finds a way.\n Then I please need assistance on how to get traffic to and from 192.168.0.100 from 192.168.2.2 , is it perhaps port forwarding on the Teltonika and Cisco side? And then setting up a firewall rule on the cisco side to not give internet access to 192.168.2.2?\n I can, going to be hard though, run a seperate cable from the Teltonika straight to the 192.168.0.100 network and then the 192.168.0.100 network is not going to be connected to the Cisco network at all, but then I'll need advise on how to set up on the Teltonika side to not give internet to 192.168.0.100 but still be able to access it.\n Thanks in advance for any assistance!\n    submitted by    /u/Beginning_Brief_534  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example: I've got a batch of PA Firewalls that insist on doing panorama connectivity checks after I change the management IP (a fine idea)... but they start doing these checks before the new IP has actually been applied (a deeply stupid idea) resulting in those checks of course failing and config reverting, even with several retries configured. This is confirmed with ping and ARP.\n So obviously a bug, but also there's a dumb but effective workaround of \"just tell the firewalls to retry EVEN MORE times, hur hur\".

(Some due to TAA concerns, some due to OS concerns. (FSOS / ONIE), etc)\n But this is a pretty big move that will legitimize FS beyond just optics. I personally swapped my production stack from Cisco to FS around 2 years ago, it was an easy transition and has been rock solid ever since. They never have issues with inventory, I've received my orders within days, and support while a little lackluster due to some obvious language barriers is pretty responsive.\n I'm curious if this triggers any others to take the plunge on FS now. I'm also curious to see how FS handles the demand, if their supply is able to stay consistent, it could be a real game changer since Dell/HP/Cisco/Juniper lead times have been abysmal.\n    submitted by    /u/ruove  \n [link]   [comments]",

The two buildings can currently talk to each other's devices as things stand today. Now I've been asked to move some (but not all) of the equipment from one office to another: VMware Host, NetApp and the ESXI switch stack. I can do basic switch configuration, trunks and vlans and whatnot but networking isn't my strong point. I know enough to hurt myself on the sharp edges. What I'm wondering is: \n If the Core Switch (lets say its 10.1.1.1) is at Building A, if I move the ESXI switch (10.1.1.2) to the other building, is it possible for me to keep it on the 10.1.1.0 network and pass through Building B's core switch with vlans and static routing (Building B is on, say, 10.50.0.0 network) and across the VPN to talk to other 10.1.1.0 resources, or is it going to be easier to re-IP everything I am moving over and let the existing routing handle it? We're trying not to do that because a lot of their network shortcuts the users have are coded to the IPs and not DNS names. Which is silly, yes, I know. \n Looking for advice as to what the \"best\" thing to do would be. And yes, I realize that hiring a networking professional is the Best thing to do, but there is no money in the budget for that. I'm going to have to figure this one out.

I'm assuming as LibreNMS identifies the Juniper as a Juniper but the Adva as a Generic Device this is why I see this difference.\n I have checked the definition and discovery files within Libre and Yaml files do exist for measuring the TX and RX of Adva_FSP150 ports. I took the OIDs being used in this file and set them up as custom OIDs in libre with Gauge selected and dbm as my unit, I do see graphs under customer OIDs but no data being pulled. When I created the customer OIDs I ran a test which said value returned & successful.\n I think my next step will be downloading a MIB browser and checking to ensure the OIDs I have from the YAML file are correct.\n If anyone can point me in the right direction it would be most appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/LamboItalia666  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use this for eBGP and with the routing table nearing 1 million routes we need to either start filtering routes or preferably replacing them with hardware which can cope with much more routes. \n As part of this upgrade we are also looking to increase the transit links from 10Gb links to 100Gb links as well as any uplinks to our core. \n At the moment we have several transits coming in so we want to look at potentially having two transits per router so that's 2 x 100Gb and then we also want dual uplinks for reslience so 4 x 100Gb in total. \n Unfortunately this takes the C8500-12X4QX out of the picture as it won't support 4 x 100Gb links. 2 x 100Gb + 1 40Gb would be fine but not more than 240Gb in enabled links. \n So the next model up would be the C8500-20x6C. This has 6 x 100Gb links which can all be enabled. However the caveat is that this is coming in at ¬£250,000 which includes a ¬£190,000 discount. Ouch! \n Unfortunately I do have to stick with Cisco for this. We do have other DC's with Juniper but in this case it HAS to be Cisco. \n I'm wondering if I should instead be looking at the ASR9000 range or if the price point of that is also going to be just as ridiculous? \n To give an idea of what Juniper is charging for their MX204 which can handle 4 x 100Gb we were recently quoted ¬£38,000 which includes the perpetual licensing. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Busbyuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are directly connected\n  \nSome further debugging:\n  \nI can see the Adjacency process begin and the DBD packets transmit \n I can see the VlXX OUT to the PA \n I can see the VlXX IN from the PA \n OUT packet len:1412 \n MTU on the router interface is 1500, verified by ping sweep \n I can see the packets retransmit until they hit 25 where it is killed due to excessive retransmission \n IN packets still come but are ignored for a timer until process repeats\n  \nSo that size 1412 shouldn't get fragmented correct? \n One other thing I noticed is that on the HA Pair, all the Vlan interfaces are setup HSRP, except the one facing the PAs. For whatever reason, those vlan interfaces are setup separate i.e. VlanXX x.x.x.1 and x.x.x.2 with no standby... \n oddly after the Neighbor exchange goes down, I see a new election between the two devices but using other HSRP Vlan interfaces, but over the OSPF VlanXX already in process. This setup seems really odd to me? Could it cause issues?\n It's been a while since I went really deep into OSPF troubleshooting so I'm at a little bit of a loss of where to go next.

The Telonika has two SIM WAN interfaces (one EE, one O2), both interfaces are set to passthrough mode and the UDM Pro is set to DHCP for on it's WAN interface. \n In bridge mode, the Teltonika is no longer accessible (as expected) however, the UDM Pro also does not get the WAN IP address and says that there is no internet connection.\n In passthrough mode the Teltonika is still accessible/ manageable through it's remote management system (as expected), the UDM Pro is adoptable onto the Unifi system and can be remotely managed. However, it's WAN IP address in the Unifi console is a private 192.168.1.x IP address and not the WAN IP the Teltonika has. Laptops connected to the UDM Pro also have no WAN connectivity even though the UDM can get firmware updates and be remotely managed.\n Where am I going wrong? Why does the UDM Pro have some connectivity in pass through mode but absolutely zero in bridge mode? \n Is it CGNAT causing the issue? Is it a NAT or firewall issue on the Teltonika?

They have performed well for us over the years. Now I see that the Cisco Small Business (i.e., Linksys-heritage) line is now no longer being produced, and now it's the \"Cisco Business\" line for SME networking. Looks like the \"Cisco Business 350-24XT Managed Switch\" would be the closest model as compared to what we've bought in the past; I have a few questions...\n 1) Is the NOS closer to Cisco IOS than the CSB line was (that was \"IOS-like\" but had quite a few different commands, etc.) 2) There's no \"DNA\" license BS with this line? 3) Are there other good choices for a 24-port 10GbT switches out there? We have been swinging our switching over to Juniper, but they don't have a good/lower-cost 24-ports of 10GbT model out there from what I can tell... \n (And also, I know 10GbT is kind of a legacy port type vs SFP+, but that's what all their servers have in the location we're buying for, and what the admin staff there knows...)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/wdennis  \n [link]   [comments]",

So any one with proper knowlege pls help me.\n 1.I have a dlink home router it's ip is 192.168.0.1. its dhcp range is 192.168.0.50 to 192.168.0.100.\n i want to extend the router wifi range and ethernet ports. \n So I have another linksys router of ip 192.168.1.1.\n I want to connect linksys router with dlink to extend wifi range and ethernet using lan cable. \n How to do it? \n My instructor said to connect one lan port of dlink router with the wan port on linksys router through a lan cable and turn off dhcp on linksys router. \n So you will get internet through linksys router. Is he right? \n Then what about the ip adress conflict between both router. One is 192.168.0.1 and other is 192.168.1.1\n Both are on Different network. Does it works? \n As per my assumption every device connected to router through the wired or wirelessly to the router should be on same network. \n If it works how to acess second router configaration page.? \n Because if we connect second router to the first router,dhcp server of first router changes the second router ip. \n Then how to know the ip of second router? \n 2.Also I have tenda router. I want to connect it to dlink router through wirelessly. \n It has a seperate wireless repeating option on configuration page. \n On that menu there is 3 option 1.wisp 2.universal repeater 3.ap mode. \n Which one should I choose? \n Also tell me the remaining changes I should do on tenda router? \n 3.does all router have wireless repeatet option? \n If don't then is any other way to connect second router to primary router wirelessly? \n 4.if we purchase a router for extension how to know it has all the function necessary for router extension?\n    submitted by    /u/nawabu_u  \n [link]   [comments]",

Apparently, this Small school has to have an internal DNS server to direct them to our website using the internal IP's. This is for all the students and everyone in every subnet. And I asked why they just don't use the public IP if it's accessible. Well, the answer was simple. You cannot access any of the internal websites from the inside using the public IP address. I thought that was strange. \n I did a basic traceroute to the website and yep, it stops on our Palo Alto firewall. It's due to an Age out/incomplete which I'm sure is due to the Virtual router in the firewall not knowing where to send the traffic. \n However, I'm not sure how this should be done. \n Do I just implement a routing rule that anyone coming to the firewall internally asks for the public IP address of our website to redirect them back through the same interface? \n Baically the Default Gateway from the Core Switch has 1 interface connected to the Palo as the next hop that connects that interface to the router, then that router has a next hop for all traffic to our actual router. \n So \n Core Switch 10.0.0.1 -> 10.0.0.2 Palo Alto Vr Router -PublicIP interface. 1 -> Public IP interface Physical Router -> The internet. \n To be clear yes the Firewall has an interface with a public IP address that we own that hops to the router with also a Public IP address that we own and then to the internet.\n    submitted by    /u/jdbrav  \n [link]   [comments]",

The swapover went well in general, but recently our users have started complaining about intermittent VOIP quality issues. I'm assuming a simple QoS policy will resolve the issue, but I'm having some issues understanding how I should go about it.\n We have two switch stacks. Three switches in a stack in one building with our ISP routers, two switches in a stack in our other building. A 10G fiber uplink connects the switch stacks between buildings.\n We have a VOIP Vlan set to Vlan 100. Most user access ports have both the VOIP Vlan and general data VLAN (200) configured. Ex:\n interface GigabitEthernet1/0/3 switchport access vlan 200 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 100 spanning-tree portfast \n Our phones are older Polycom devices, not Cisco.\n I've read up on Cisco Auto QoS, but I've also read it's not the most efficient way of implementing QoS. Especially in an environment that isn't using Cisco phones. I started a support case with Cisco, but they just sent me the Auto QoS documentation I already have...\n Can anyone help me understand what should be done here?

But I can't connect the tasks with each other. \n How can I simulate this behavior? Is there a better simulation tool than OMNeT++ for this use case?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Happy_Shift_3991  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In this question we will explore the dynamics of two flows using the AIMD (additive increase, multiplicative decrease) and later AIAD (additive increase, additive\n decrease) algorithm instead of AIMD. Consider the topology shown in which two hosts A and B are sending packets to D through router R. \n The bottleneck link in the path from R to D runs at 10 MB/s (i.e. 10 Megabytes per second). The RTTs from A to D and B to D are 100 ms. Assume that both A and B can\n communicate with R instantaneously and with arbitrarily large rate. Assume that each packet has a length of 1250 bytes and the buffer on router R can hold 200\n packets.\n Suppose that at time t = 0, host A has a congestion window of 999 packets, B has a congestion window of 0, and R‚Äôs buffer is empty. You should assume that packet\n drops are always experienced by the flow with more packets in flight. You should assume that each flow updates its congestion window after each RTT, decreasing it if\n any packet was dropped, and increasing it otherwise.\n AIMD: We first consider the evolution of the system when each flow is governed by AIMD, in which the congestion window grows by being incremented and shrinks by\n being halved (rounding down). In roundtrips 0 through 3, the system evolves as shown in the table below with host A exceeding the given congestion window size and\n accordingly reducing CWND to half in the next iteration. \n Now, suppose that instead we are using an AIAD protocol. In this case, every drop decreases the congestion window by 5 packets (to a minimum of 1 packet) instead\n of halving the congestion window. What is the congestion windows size of host A at t = 300 RTTs? Give your answer in packets. \n The solution states, it should be 300 but I do not understand why and there is nothing else provided.\n ‚Äã\n Please help!\n    submitted by    /u/FrainBreez_Tv  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Router is in front so the structure is ISP - Router - DNS - Firewall - Internal Network. \n This external DNS keeps the Host and only Host A files that lets the internet know that website A is IP whatever for the college. \n I believe the DNS servers forward the traffic to Quad9 or something like that, not sure why, but if some one can assist to the reason, I'm sure its a verification method or something to proof that we are the actual college we are advertising or to tell other larger DNS providers know who we are if some one form another state tries to reach our website. \n So on to my question. Is there a better way? I would like to move our records off site to something like cloud flair. However I set up a meeting with them and they said the minimum they covered was for websites that hit 1 million hits per month. Obviously its a community college in a rural area so we get around 17,000 hits.

I think it was confusion because the prices on the website did not match up to what they were telling me. \n Can any one clarify if Cloud Flair is free to host records and all I have to do is just verify that we are who we say we are? \n or really any better solution to external DNS hosting or is it fine the way we have it set up?\n    submitted by    /u/jdbrav  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I have recently been trying to find out a deep dive into what exactly networking ports are. This is regarding TCP and UDP ports.\n Whenever I search what exactly are networking ports, I see explanations about how they are a way to identify a service. \n I have not seen explanations on how this is achieved.\n When a server receives a request on port 22, the TCP/IP stack inspects the destination port, and sees the number 22 there. Is the TCP/IP stack configured in such a way that each port number must be associated with a certain service, like if the number is 22, then forward the request to the sshd service?\n After the TCP/IP stack inspects the port number, will it forward the request to the relevant service - sshd in this case?\n I have thought of ports as \"gates\" to remotely access a service. Each service has its own PID, but this PID stays local, so ports are a way to access these services remotely. We won't be able to remotely access the service by its PID. But we can access the service if there is a TCP/IP stack that does the forwarding of request based on the destination port number?\n The questions above are just my own explanation of how ports are bound to services, and how the TCP/IP stack assists in forwarding the request to the relevant service. If anybody has knowledge in this, it would be great for someone to share it.\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/arthu_sp  \n [link]   [comments]",

It'll chew up 100s of meg's of disk space a day and my SSD hard drive is taking a lot of write cycles. Is there a way to turn that down or off?\n EDIT: I have eve-ng pro 5.0.1-20, it's recently installed. I think I helped my ssd out a little bit with these fixes:\n  \nedited these two lines in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf\n  \n‚Äã\n # max_binlog_size = 100M skip-log-bin \n Since I have no plans on making this a cluster server for eve in the future I just disabled the binlog/logbin feature. This partially helped my problem, I noticed slightly less disk IO, but there was still a lot. It maybe decreased things by 10-25%. But the overall disk usage will not continually climb from the /var/lib/mysql/binlog.xxxxxx files.\n iotop showed this yet: 567481 be/4 mysql 0.00 B/s 551.38 K/s ?unavailable? mysqld [ib_pg_flush_co]\n ib_pg_flush_co was still writing a lot. So I did an strace of that process and it was doing io_submit about once a second. I just happened to google the very last option in the mysqld.cnf file \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2\". A quick google suggests that it forces a write cycle once a second.\n  \n edited \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2\" from 2 to 1 (the default), and restarted mysql again.\n  \nEDIT2: This only worked temporarily. After a reboot of the eve-ng box the issue came back. and ib_pg_flush_co is still writing to disk constantly.\n    submitted by    /u/cdavelaar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm certain the system doesn't have a fiber channel HBA as it utilizing the NDC card described. One of the SFP+ NIC port on the same card has an cat 7 ethernet cable connected also by transceiver and has no issues, status lights are green. I've tried swapping the ports I'm connecting the fiber but no luck. I'm very new with this type of networking and hoping someone more experienced can point out the obvious.

But, when I try to dial 933 to verify the more granular E911 location, it can't seem to sort out the MAC address of the switch it's connected to so it can be more precise.\n So far, I ran lldp run on the switch, and it seems to now be on. If I run show lldp neighbors, I get all the phones, APs, and other junk on the switch. But, the phone still doesn't seem to know what's going on. Running LDWin on a client machine to read the LLDP packets doesn't yield any results either. Either I'm getting erroneous results, or LLDP isn't configured correctly.\n Looking at the Cisco documentation, it looks like I may need to run lldp transmit and lldp receive on the specific interfaces, but that hasn't gotten me anywhere either.

          "description": "First, I inherited this nightmare, it isn‚Äôt my creation. I‚Äôm just tasked with making this whole thing work and so far I‚Äôm at an almost complete loss on the best way to segment this mess. It‚Äôs a fairly large subnet class c /21 with everything (and I do mean everything) on a single network. One of the biggest hurdles that I‚Äôve had is diagnosing where the current loops are due to the Unifi system meshing (if meshing is turned off, nothing works which tells me it wasn‚Äôt designed correctly to begin with). So I‚Äôm trying to come up with a new design that will use what I‚Äôve been given (they went building to building instead of each building back to the core due to the costs for horizontal boring). I‚Äôve got two actual routers (Cisco) and some newer Catalyst 9200‚Äôs which are capable of full L3 routing (full meaning they can use an actual routing protocol and not just static). \n My first thought is to segment out each building with it‚Äôs own network and VLAN but I am at a loss on making it so everything can still get to everything (this is a live production/manufacturing facility so they cannot go down).The only way to really isolate the loops that remain (this network grew at rapid speed over about 20 years - things just kept being added on and not properly tracked) is to attempt to use the Catalyst devices as ‚Äúborder routers‚Äù. I‚Äôve been working in this field for over 20 years and I can honestly say, this is the first network that hasn‚Äôt been a standard full mesh or hub and spoke design. So I‚Äôm reaching out to the wise folks on here to see if I‚Äôm going about this the right way or if perhaps someone out there has experience with such a thing and can give me some pointers. I‚Äôve been removing every hub/non managed switch I can find as I come across them because they seem to quite literally be everywhere lol along with documenting how everything actually connects for future reference.\n    submitted by    /u/Corsoboundheart  \n [link]   [comments]",

But is there a hardware PCAP device that someone could recommend that is easily attaced to a port mirror on a switch that captures all the traffic, saves it as a PCAP for troubleshooting using Wireshark and possibly even have a web interface of some sort to download the PCAP files from?\n I'm unable to find a good tool online.\n That would really makes this process a lot easier because we'd be able to ship this thing to a client preconfigured and they just need to hook it up to a switch.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Fit_chicken_pizza  \n [link]   [comments]",

From the start the Internet connection was weak even while being connected to the closest satelite available. We've done everything we could together with the IT department. We've been allocated the maximum available bandwidth, they have redone the firewall policies and available ports but still extremely weak connection with the outside.\n One thing that kept reoccurring in our conversations was their inability to maintain a stable connection while connecting to our servers and the fact that there is a loop in our network.\n My problem is that on local network everything seems to work perfectly fine.

(And K8 is for managing all the docker containers running those applications). \n Maybe I'm looking at this wrong, but I don't see how any of that interacts with a role where the primary task is maintaining and building a network. (And thus the dilemma (when it comes to applying for other roles) that I've never interacted with any of these things outside of youtube videos and playing around with small scale versions in my home lab) \n I get the idea of treating your network configs as code and keeping them in some kind of VCS like git, but does anyone actually have a CI/CD pipeline for pushing networking config changes?
