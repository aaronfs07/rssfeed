          "description": "SUMMARY\nIn 2022, LockBit was the most deployed ransomware variant across the world and continues to be prolific in 2023. Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in obse…",

Never had issues before.\n The only fix I have found at the moment is creating the following key on the print server: Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Print\\RpcAuthnLevelPrivacyEnabled and setting it to 0 - but I am almost certain that this then introduces the print nightmare vulnerability again.\n What gives?

Their API doesn't seem to offer any restore capabilities. You can only restore to original location, but I don't want to interrupt the live VM.

Essentially, I still need to update this machine to Server 2022, but I also need to keep the CA in place, at least for now.\n I think the easiest path forward is as follows, but wanted to seek advice incase I'm missing something obvious as I've never dealt with a CA before.\n Prep so far:I have moved FSMO roles to a new DC, I have also spun up an extra DC to replace this one and put them in place as new DNS servers.\n Planned steps:\n  \nTake a CA backup, including the root certificate, Private Key etc.\n Remove AD CS from old DC\n Demote old DC\n Remove the old server from the domain\n Install Windows Server 2022 fresh with the same name as the old server; join it to the domain. 6. Install AD CS using existing root certificate and CA settings. 7. Restore the CA backup on the new server.\n  \nAm I missing anything critical? Seems like the CA is only issuing some certs for Directory Services, LDAPS and some intranet sites, so I'm not sure how essential it is but that's a problem for after I get rid of all the other 2012R2 VMs.\n Thanks in advance for any tips!\n    submitted by    /u/Kabuboru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n We have around 15 workstations and 2 printers on the second floor. We recently bought two (2) new workstations and noticed that neither of them were getting any signal from the ethernet/switch (computer said no ethernet cable connected). I troubleshooted it for a while and noticed that every time I disabled the ethernet adapter, the lights on the ethernet port starting to show some data. To me, this seem like a driver or Windows issue so I updated the drivers using the latest one from the MB's website with no success. I also clean installed Windows and no success.\n One thing I did notice is that they would get internet if the connection was bridged. For example, our VoIP phones have a PC port. When bringing a cable from the VoIP port, the computer would get internet. I also tried with a 5 port switch and it actually worked too. It seems that the issue is when connected directly to the wall.\n When I noticed that everything worked when not plugged directly to the wall, I started to mess around the connection on the switch and no matter what I did the issue was always there. What seems strange to me is that no other workstation that are already there present similar issue. I even connected the computer to one port that was already working for someone else and the PC will not recognize the ethernet cable.\n I grab the computers and brought them to a different floor and they work fine when connected directly to the wall. This makes me think that it could be a switch related issue. This is the first time I come across something like this in my work experience. I have called a couple of friends who were also clueless on what could be the issue.\n Any advise will be greatly appreciated!!\n    submitted by    /u/monedadeoro  \n [link]   [comments]",

This demand for RHEL code is disingenuous. \n  \nI mean, fair enough. We 'bought in' to the RHEL ecosystem, running Centos in prod, and now were moving to Alma. We had a few RHEL support contracts for \"key\" servers, but mostly stuck with the open source options, and found that having an easy 'move-to-prod' road was of some value. \n Shooting down Alma, Rocky, Oracle Linux and Centos all at once though? Well, I guess that's a pretty solid 'F you' and we'll now have to review our options. I guess this might drive some license fees out of us, but it might as easily push us to 'never RedHat'.

You lose this ability when security defaults is turned on.\n In a best case scenario, I'd like to achieve the following. When we create a new user on-prem and after AAD connect runs and syncs the user up into O365 we want to make sure that MFA is enabled by default for that new user. I don't want to have to wait up to 30 minutes after we have created the account for the sync to finish, then login to the O365 portal and then manually enable MFA for the new user. We want this to be automatic.\n How would I achieve this? We could set up a conditional access policy, but I don't know exactly what to configure to make that a reality. The Microsoft support rep we spoke with says even if we did a conditional access policy, we would still have to manually enable MFA for the new user, which is what we're trying to avoid.\n    submitted by    /u/cyr0nk0r  \n [link]   [comments]",

But according to the tooltip in \"parted magic\" Secure Erase ALSO overwrites everything with 0 or resets the NAND to 0 via a volt spike.\n So why is sanitize better than secure erase if in the end you still have only zeros everywhere.\n I read that sanitize also has stuff like crpyto scramble.

I have a VMware ESXi server, and to simplify things let's say it currently has 10 VMs, each VM having a management NIC, and a customer VLAN NIC. Currently I can use a service like NRPE to execute commands on each VM, and NRPE runs a networking command (like a cURL, ping, or similar) over the customer network NIC. The NRPE agent listens on the management NIC, but executes the commands over the customer VLAN NIC.\n Customer wise, for simplicity we'll say customers are called Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, and so on. Their VLANs correspond like 10, 20, 30, and so on. Each customer network has an identical IP space of 10.0.0.0/8, and the IP of this VM will be identical in each of the networks.\n I'm building a new VM which has a single management NIC, and a single trunk NIC (VLAN 4095 in VMware parlance). I've tested configuring the secondary NIC on the VM as Customer1 with VLAN 10 tagged, and that works fine (so the port is all good), but I'm having trouble with network namespaces. My end goal is to be able to run commands like ip netns exec customer1 ping 8.8.8.8 and get the results (quick crap example, but you get the idea).\n I tried to borrow the principles from [this article] but it wouldn't work for me. \n Is what I'm trying to do possible?\n    submitted by    /u/iDemonix  \n [link]   [comments]",

No matter how many minutes i select in GPO and apply it I always see the same result. If the Windows are not locked then it works like expected.\n Only if I set the display to never turn off (so 0 in GPO) and never on energy settings in Windows does the monitor stay awake - but this is not something that we want. After you are not around for 15-20 minutes there is no reason to keep the monitors turned on.\n Hybrid sleep is off. The monitor settings have been checked multiple times, there is no any power saving mode active. The same thing happens if the laptop is on its own, the display will turn off in a matter of seconds.

          "description": "Lately I’ve been looking to see if there are any native options there that support cloud file share as well as a similar fashion of ACLs and locking down folder permissions likely your typical NTFS shares. \n Our environment has a presence of AADDS (Azure AD domain services), however, this isn’t on-prem and it’s soely used for virtual machines, only. \n Our machines are AAD Cloud joined, and our user identities are also cloud sourced. From looking, the only native option for file share in Azure is Azure Files, and it doesn’t support NTFS permissions, plus only works with storage account keys. You can only truly use Kerberos and ACL permissions if your identities are hybrid, (the devices can still be AAD joined in this case) \n Given the fact that, if we were to have our identities hybrid, we’d be able to receive Kerberos tickets on an AAD joined machine, in result this opens a few doors for us, without even having the need to hybrid join machines. \n The other option would be to dump 10+ TB into sharepoint, however, to me, that makes absolutely no sense as Sharepoint Online is not meant to replace a file system. \n Thoughts? Would it better a better option to ditch the managed domain in AADDS and move to ADDS? Users would be hybrid, devices would still be cloud joined. So it wouldn’t necessarily be completely moving to “on-prem”, plus if we already have and utilize Azure AD domain services, I don’t really see a point in it, being that Azure AD domain services is extremely limited and probably better for a mom & pop shop type of environment.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Hearing3804  \n [link]   [comments]",

Once the website loads the issue goes away until you start a new browser session.\n Chrome Network Timings: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/616069974192291840/1122696364787257374/image.png\n Troubleshooting\n First, we suspected a server-side issue, but this occurs on MANY different unrelated websites, in-fact nearly any website has the same issue if it is using HTTPS.\n Secondly, we have tested using different Internet connections, ISPs, mobile hotspot, DNS servers and Proxy servers, all which did not resolve the issue, this leans me to believe this is purely a device-level issue.\n We have tested different browsers, Edge (Chromium) and Firefox do NOT experience this issue, only Google Chrome. Furthermore, we have not had any reports from MacOS users yet, only windows users. All windows machines running the latest OS updates.\n Updating to the latest version of chrome does not resolve the issue. Older versions, beta, etc also experience the issue.\n My suspicion is that there is an issue relating to both windows/chrome interacting together that is causing the SSL/Initial Connection to hang for a long period of time when loading pages. But I cannot isolate any particular cause.\n Im at a loss for where to look next at this point, the issue seems to be disconnected from any specific client, software, policy, etc. \n Would like to hear if any other Techs out there have seen anything like this?

          "description": "Like many people currently, I just moved a handful of domains away from Google Domains. As expected, all domain transfers added one year to the expiration, except one.\n This one domain was \"auto renewed\" at Google domains just over a week before being transferred. The transfer did not add a year to the expiration. I asked the new registrar what happened and they said the domain was in the auto-renewal grace period, which occurs after a domain has expired. I thought there's no way, Google auto renewed the domain, how could it have expired?\n So I started looking at my Google domain transactions. If the transaction dates are anything to go by, the domain was originally purchased at X time. The \"auto renew\" transaction happened one year later on the same date, but at X + just under two hours. So it appears Google domains let this domain expire for almost two hours before the \"auto renew\" took place. This put the domain into the grace period which means when I transferred it, no additional year was added.\n Again, this is what appears to have happened. Going off of transaction times and the fact that the transfer didn't add a year to the expiration. Google domains says the auto renew feature is supposed to renew a domain within a month before expiration. It seems like they didn't and cost me a year's worth of registration. Not a lot of money, but what bothers me more is thinking my domain may not have been working, which I use mainly for email, for almost two hours before the auto renew happened. And I probably wouldn't have noticed if I didn't transfer it.\n If anyone from Google domains is here, you owe me $12.\n    submitted by    /u/brsh2  \n [link]   [comments]",

The configuration profile marks as successful, but in the security admin center under device inventory I don't currently see any devices listed in there. I have created some AV policies but AFAIK they are not working (for example I tried to disable the user from being able to open defender settings, and currently I can still override my AV settings just by going through the Windows Defender security settings).\n I downloaded and ran some well known malware (mimikatz) and was able to launch and run commands in mimikatz. About 5 mins of the computer sitting idle, I heard a few notifications come in saying \"Enterprise unwanted application found\" and indicates it deleted the threats. \n I'm fairly confused, clearly that doesn't seem right. I re-enrolled the device a second time using the local script .cmd approach however I still don't see any devices listed in the M365 Defender/security admin portal. There is no indicator on the client that DFE MDE has been installed (does it need to be \"installed\" per se or just enrolled?)\n Obviously being able to launch and run commands in mimikatz was only possible because I disabled the real time protection and clicked past many warnings, but still something doesn't seem right there. Is DFE MDE just a centralized location for admins to manipulate built in Windows Defender settings?

I did a demo with their engineer and the product looks pretty good. Pricing isn't terrible but the one big issue I have is the snmp polling interval.\n All of their product information talks about 1 minute polling, but apparently their on premise poller for snmp monitoring only does 5 minute polling? They keep side stepping the issue saying they still do up/down monitoring every minute, but statistics like in/out bandwidth is only collected once every 5 minutes.\n Is this correct? If so, for anyone else that uses site24x7 and has their on premise poller, have you had issues with the granularity only being 5 minutes?\n    submitted by    /u/cyr0nk0r  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been trying to think through options for when this thing either dies or goes EOL and I remembered clients at my previous MSP job running AAD with no on-prem DC and was wondering what drawbacks exist for this configuration? Some notes:\n -The church has E3 365 licenses already.\n -The only apps they use are the Quickbooks installed on the server and 365 apps locally.\n -Ideally they would get an MSP to help them but the church has very little money.\n I want to make the environment as maintenance free as possible, as going onsite is a full day trip. Any suggestions or ideas are greatly appreciated!\n EDIT: Thanks for all the reply’s and advice. At the end of the day there’s only about 5 users and only 2 of them are full time so any solution will likely work well enough. Setting up AD was probably overkill but it was setup years ago and I don’t want to reinvent the entire network if I don’t have to.

I probably cannot just ask them, as the company is old-school and they'd prefer me just sitting idlely for an hour even though I have nothing to do.\n Our setup is as follows, Azure Active Directory, every machine is a Windows, all connected on the same internal network that you have to 2FA into your machine. All of the network is monitored and goes through a proxy. We also have laptop window machines that work on the same active directory account and if you want to access your work station inside the office from home, you have to use their VPN and then Remote Desktop into it. This all works great, and while I am not a Windows user myself, I am really pleased as to how nice the experience is, considering the heavy emphasis on safety.\n Now to my question, to what extent can my employer track me? My main questions are about the laptop, when it's not connected to their network/ VPN, is there anything inside the laptop/ windows that is tracking what I am doing? Do I have to cover my camera? I am mostly asking because after finishing my work for the day and I am at the office, I usually have an hour or so to kill before I can go home, and I would like to Remote Desktop/ SSH into my home machine and continue working on my own stuff, but I am not sure if these can be tracked and if I would alert someone like I am doing something shady. \n Basically I would like to access my own machine from the work laptop without causing problems for anyone. \n    submitted by    /u/West-Papaya  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I compare the specs, this computer has really great specs even compared to older large rack servers. But this computer defaults to home use and not as a server.\n Does it make sense to buy this computer as a 24/7 server to host my online store? In fact, it will be just one Ubuntu system or virtualization with two systems. The website will be made mainly in PHP + mysql. My main concerns are the inability to use ecc memory and the processor, although its parameters are impressive 12-cores 16-threads maybe it's not a processor that can handle the load generated by hundreds of users on a website so well?\n Unfortunately I don't have room for a bigger server at home - rack servers are very noisy and smaller ones like the proliant micorserver are still quite big.

WMI for Windows, SNMP for Linux/appliances, and so on. but, it feels very, very stuck in the past. like, it's 2023 and they still do not support recurring maintenance window scheduling, or rules like \"only alert if the alarm threshold has been exceeded for X scan intervals\". maddening.\n the handful of other products i've tried -- PDQdeploy, ManageEngine Patch Manager, Automox, Level dot io -- do not (at the time i tested each one) support pre- or post-patch scripting, e.g., stop the specified service and wait for the process to terminate before beginning patching. naturally, i'm tired of doing it manually in BatchPatch but i just haven't found a solid replacement yet.\n i have about 140 Windows servers (98% VM's) that i need to deal with.\n please give me recommendations on products and/or process improvements that you've found to make this task easier. thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/No_Direction4544  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Today my manager, who is the assistant director of IT, offered me a position as a junior cybersecurity analyst. I work in small-medium grocery store company in the helpdesk and the company currently does not have anyone working in a security role so they are looking for someone internally to possibly fulfill that position in a junior role.\n I feel like I should jump at the role immediately as it's a significant promotion but to be completely honest I'm just not sure if I want to go into the security route. I'm still attending school as a computer science major and only have one semester left for this fall to graduate. I've been leaning more towards doing something in web development instead, however, I also feel like I may be throwing away a huge opportunity to get a job right away while still in my last semester and not deal with the stress of looking for a job after graduating with little experience. I'm thinking of taking the job, gaining the experience, and if I still feel like I'd rather do web development jump into that after a year of doing security.\n Would it be wise to just take the opportunity and see what happens? Or should I only accept the role if I feel I have a future in security? I don't want to screw the company or myself over for the future. I'm definitely open and willing to try out a new field and do what is necessary to do well in the position but am unsure if I'm making the right decision.

I was reading that the best option could be a NAS server with RAID. The brand I mostly hear is Synology. We use W7, W10 and MacOs. Wich server do you recommend me for our needs? We need to have remote access in case we are not in the office btw.\n Thanks in advance for any advice :)\n Edit:\n Thank you all for your advices. Many has suggested using cloud. However I had a bad experience with OneDrive (lost information). For me there are three advantages of not using cloud. 1 You only pay once/not monthly payment (as far as I know, so in long term is cheaper) 2 can use your files even if there's not internet 3 easier to make backups.\n However I will be open minded\n    submitted by    /u/Malacho_21  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys.\n We have a few Dell R720 servers with a PERC H710P Mini Raid controller. We bought a few Samsung 1643a SAS SSD drives that we would like to use to extend the life of these old servers a bit.\n When installing the drives, they were properly recognized, they show up in IDRAC. I set up a new Virtual Disk, configured the RAID array, did a fast initialization (as the drives were brand new), everything went smoothly.\n However, on reboot, it took a very long time for the server to start, and it stops at the PERC initialization with the message \"Adapter at Baseport is not responding. No adapter\" and fails to continue to boot.\n Removing the drives, the adapter is initialized and the machine boots.\n I also tried adding the drives while I was in the BIOS RAID utility, and it's the same, as via IDRAC. The drives get recognized, RAID array configuration works, but upon reboot, it stops with the same error message.\n Before the error message pops up, the drives' LEDs blink slowly, sequentially (one after the other). After a few minutes, they all blink fast. I let it be for a few hours, but did not change the results.\n Here are some other things I tried already:\n  \nfirmware/bios update - everything is up to date\n only connected 1/2/4/6 drives at a time\n removed other drives in the enclosure\n perform a full initialization of the raid array from the BIOS RAID utility\n opened up the server and checked the cables, battery, reseated the adapter\n used another identical server\n  \nAny idea of what might be wrong?\n Anyone else use this combo R720/H710P/1643a?\n Thanks a bunch!\n    submitted by    /u/Ditzah  \n [link]   [comments]",

Because it was a huge pain and I found no resources online, plus Lenovo’s premium tech support couldn’t help over the phone.\n Long story short: Borked Windows install on tower and wanted to run an official recovery install rather than a clean one. Recovery Creator was failing to create the installer USB drive.\n Steps initially taken:\n  \n Placed online digital order for recovery\n  Inserted a flash drive\n  Downloaded Lenovo USB Recovery Creator and ran it\n  Signed in and selected my digital order\n  Let it download the media\n  Allowed it to attempt to create the USB recovery key\n  \nAt this point it failed, with a number of errors mentioning that it could no longer find the flash drive and that it failed at partitioning the drive.\n Checked disk management and found it had created a RAW 32GB partition and left the rest of the space unallocated. Looked like it failed after that initial partitioning, right before formatting.\n What it took to get it to work:\n Disk management failed every time I tried to manually repartition or in any way ‘fix’ the USB drive.\n I had to use diskpart, select the disk, clean it, create partition primary. After this I was able to successfully modify the drive through disk management again.\n Some more testing and I discovered you basically have to manually create the 32GB FAT32 partition on a flash drive and most importantly, assign it a letter. Make sure to leave the rest of the drive space unallocated. Then use the recovery creator to actually write the media and create the recovery USB.\n Don’t manually create and format the partition? The recovery creator will try to do it itself and fail. Messing up your flash drive and requiring diskpart to fix.\n Don’t assign a drive letter after partitioning and formatting? Recovery creator will simply fail.\n Best of luck to anyone who may come across this in their time of need.\n    submitted by    /u/DanielThiberge  \n [link]   [comments]",

Additionally, since there are so many nested directories, it can take clicking through multiple levels before realizing whether you’re in the right directory to start with.\n Is there a good, ready/easy to deploy system that can create a clean searchable directory of directories and file paths?

          "description": "I have a user that thinks a hacker is out to get him. They downloaded an app on their phone to show where all the microphones and cameras are hiding in their house and office to record them . When I pointed out that there was nothing on the wall where the app said there was a camera, they said it must be to small to see. They know someone was in their house because they were missing their sunglasses at home, and the glasses were on their work desk when they got to work. So the \"hacker\" also has keys to his house and our office, supposedly. They reloaded their personal laptop and then said that the BIOS is hacked because it created an X drive while reloading. His work computer is hacked because there are updates with all capital names, and some without, and that's not how Microsoft would push out updates. Email that takes longer then a few second to receive from their personal account to their work account is because they are being intercepted, edited, and then delivered.\n Once a week I get emails with walls of text and screen shots, wanting to know things like why does the All users folder look exactly like the Program Data folder?\n Currently, they are pulling up the dev console on any financial sites (They work in accounting) and saying that the java script does not look right. I told them to make a report with the financial institutions and let them know their concerns.\n Has anyone else had to deal with people ill like this at work? What is the best course of action that you have found? I talked with HR and my supervisor, but neither acted like it was a pressing concern and suggested I ignore their emails.\n    submitted by    /u/bmort78  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As the title says. You can't fleece or finesse your way getting local, high-skilled techs to do your work for you, run your business, onboard clients and expect to streamline your work in a matter of a few years, while sitting back drinking, snorting powder, or whatever pipe dreams you have. It may work for a little while, but you will eventually end up with employees, and clients alike, who will devalue your business to its demise. \n Where I'm from there's a toxic culture of this at the moment. Just because you started your IT career in 08 doesn't quantify your business for 15 years in service with a solid client base, when you decided to break off in 2018 and \"be your own boss\".\n Now, this is mainly for prospective employees looking to get into the MSP realm, fresh out of college, first IT jobs. Be very, very careful when applying and accepting positions for MSP's. Do your research, look up the directors and consultants and their history. If you don't, you will burn your resume with short stints at these failed businesses, who fight over breadcrumb clients with their empty promises of a seamless silver service. \n Always ratio the business in terms of current techs to managed clients before accepting a position - at the moment a safe zone and job security is 1:50, and may even move more towards 1:75 1:100 as more businesses go cloud. Anything less and you are only going to fill a void for 6-12 months and end up in the endless cycle of last in first out, as business goes through peaks and troughs at certain times of the year. \n This is not speculation, it's a reality.\n    submitted by    /u/EvolvedChimp_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey there! Just wanted to share a bit about my background. I joined my company as a network engineer about 3 months ago, bringing along my CCNP certification and previous experience in Cisco networking. Although I have some familiarity with basic Linux commands, my main expertise lies in the networking side of IT.\n Now, here's where things get interesting. The senior system administrator recently left the company, leaving me in charge of managing all the systems and servers. To be honest, I feel a bit overwhelmed and lacking in confidence. The senior guy still tries to help me out when he can, but he's got his own projects keeping him busy.\n The senior IT guy at our company has over 20 years of experience, and he's incredibly knowledgeable. He seems to have a natural understanding of all aspects of systems and developments. Technical stuff comes easily to him, so he never really felt the need to document everything. Before he left, he did his best to teach me, but I must admit it wasn't enough for me. I'm not placing any blame on him, though. In fact, I really liked working with him and learned a lot. I'm simply sharing my current situation and the challenges I'm facing in my role.\n Let me give you an idea of what I'm dealing with. I've got my hands full with various VMs, including a Perforce server, TrueNAS, Active Directory, PFSense firewall, NextCloud, and several customer server VMs. The thing is, I'm fairly new to VMware systems, Linux, NAS, and PFSense. It doesn't seem like the company is planning to hire a senior IT person anytime soon, so it looks like I'll be flying solo in the IT department for a while.\n I know I need to upskill and expand my knowledge, but any advice or tips you have for someone in my shoes would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/kus222  \n [link]   [comments]",

I work for an MSP where it's a very small number of people (30, whole company) supporting literally thousands of pcs and servers as we have a fair number of clients. We are constantly swamped, under pressure, behind, but they don't want to pay another person. On top of all of this, there are serious communication issues.\n This is my first experience with an MSP so I don't know what's normal and what isn't, but 1 am being paid 35,000 a year for this and I'm about done. I took the crap salary for the experience and l've gained serious experience with Exchange, 365, ADs, firewall policies, dhcp, etcetera so it wasn't a complete loss.\n My issue is : I'm ready to take the experience learned and jump ship, but I'm scared that maybe it's just this rubbish everywhere. Is this normal? What's a normal workload? I have only had a couple years of work in IT before this. Is this just the world of sysadmin, network engineer in general?

If I wait around 3-5 minutes and then try the add on or via the link they both work just fine.\n Teams also starts when a user logs on, normally ready within the first 20 seconds of being logged in and is definitely running by the time the users try to access the meeting.\n I have made sure the browser, teams and Outlook are all up to date but still have this issue.\n I can only assume that there is something Teams needs to be running before it has this function and it takes around 3-5 minutes for this to run. Does anyone have a fix/work-a-round for this or encountered the same issue I'd love to know.\n Or if anyone knows what it is teams waits for I could even try looking into finding a way to get this running much sooner in the log on processthat'd be great.\n Any help is much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/owen_haley  \n [link]   [comments]",

We moved over to Defender about a year ago but never really got around to looking into how deep the rabbit hole truly goes.

She wants to upgrade most of them and try to reuse any useful parts from the old ones.\n In the past, she has had issues around user security and people messing up the devices. First thing I'm wondering is what's the go-to solution for desktop device management in small business offices where everyone is using Windows.\n Second, I'm thinking whether it would be a wise move to buy 1 or 2 excellent servers and just give everyone a Windows VM running in the server that they can connect to via a thin-client from their desks. Does this type of solution work well, or is it better to just give everyone a good dedicated machine running Windows for them to use?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/TheSaasDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

This tool should allow us to pick a combination of architectures (ARM, x86, M1/M2, etc) and OSes (Mac, Linux, Windows, etc) to auto-deploy either on a local server or cloud device. Once the deployment is done, we will execute some automation tools to validate a test branch of our software, report some findings, and then terminate the test device. The test VMs won't live very long; just long enough to run some test cases and record the output (via shared volume, etc).\n At this point, we are looking at a varity of deploment tools (LXD, Docker, Terraform, etc) but have not landed on one just yet. The important thing is the ability to select from a matrix of architecture and OS selections, click \"GO\", and ultimately get access to the test systems.\n Hope this makes sense.

Has anyone else felt like this before and how you navigated it?\n I could stay but i just feel stuck on helpdesk. The sysadmin above me was doing it for like 6 years before he moved up to more server stuff and projects. But i could only go up if someone comes under me or everyone above moves up 1 position but the company would never hire more people we been struggling to get a third in one location since i joined. \n I don’t hold any certs but studying Net+ at the moment\n I don’t really care for the end users and rest of the company but the IT teams are really great chill guys to work with.

          "description": "Hi all, hoping to get some of that sweet sweet community wisdom on this before I make the point of no return step of Plugging In A Power Cable. Here, I am the end user who knows enough to be dangerous.\n I have a beloved 4port DVI KVM that has served me for 15y+ and has outlived its own, and a replacement generic power supply. The manufacturer gives the spec as \"DC5.3V:5.91W:53BTU\". This means little to me beyond VxA=W, therefore 1.11509433962 Amp. I don't have a clue what BTU means, I assume it's some sort of pre IEEE British Tickling Unit standard for calculating time/distance/nautical speed/psychological moustache impact.\n So armed with this basic knowledge, I conclude I need a 5.3 Volt 1.11509433962 Amp DC power supply of +1 good luck finding that on ebay roll a D6 for No.\n However, the long serving recently deceased 5v generic PSU would suggest there are ranges and tolerances to device power distribution. As did a confusing and in hindsight extremely troubling conversation with my teenage era physics teacher which concluded with \"meh, over/undervolt by up to 50% you don't have to get all precious about it\". \n \"Sir..\", as I was institutionally minded to refer to him as a child of the mid 80s to 90s English school system, \"make sense, my autism begs you. It's either 5.3 Volt 1.11509433962 Amp on your own GCSE final exam paper, or it's chaos. Please which is it?\"\n So my questions is:\n Given that USB is 5v, and fast charging phone PSUs are not limited to the 500mA standard, and I have worked in IT for over two decades and have never thrown anything away, is there a chance I can MacGyver a solution right now in my home after an entire bottle of wine, or at least for less than a fiver on ebay searching for \"USB to DC multi connector cable\" ?\n ​\n Thank you all in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Echolalalalalalalia  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our SAN is starting to run out of space and we don't have the money to replace the whole thing at the moment (I can't add nodes because StoreVirtual is discontinued). I am looking for ways to free up some space on the SAN and the prime candidate would be to move our primary file server as it is using 2.75TB of space. The two VMware 5.5 host servers have 5 TB of local RAID as this was originally used for VM storage before we got the SAN. So, I am trying to figure out how to create a HA file server using this empty space. My first idea was to just setup two new VMs and cluster them but that requires shared storage which I don't have. Then I looked at Storage Spaces Direct but that requires some high-end network infrastructure that I don't have. I have looked at trying to setup some sort of mirrored storage in VM directly but I don't see any way to do that. Nor can I add disks from two different hosts to the same VM to do OS based mirroring. My last option is to use DFS Replication but I'm not sure how to do this without shared storage. I would also need to do a standalone namespace because of all the things that point to the existing UNC. Does anyone know if I can do DFS replication across a Windows Cluster or are there any better solutions?\n    submitted by    /u/CaynadianToo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I will be making the current OS into a baseline, but I would like to make it into an ISO so I can keep it as a baseline. The problem is, I don't want a full disk to be used, and make an ISO that is 300GB big. \n For a temporary solution, I thought of keeping the RAID1, and adding more disks to create another virtual RAID1, then clone over the OS to the other RAID. I haven't gone into research with this yet as I am just drafting up solutions. \n Another way is what I mentioned above. I thought of using `mkisofs` and `dd` to create a ISO, but I am unsure if that would work properly. \n ​\n If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear them. I am currently a little stuck.

          "description": "I've set up ADFS about a year ago for two services that do not offer LDAP sign-in and now the first automated certificate rollover happened, which unfortunately caused problems.\n When the new signing certificate got promoted to \"Primary\", authentication stopped working for both relaying services until they got updated with the new cert, the old one was still listed as \"Secondary\" though. I do not have any experience with other SAML providers and therefore do not know if they have similar cert renewal mechanisms and how other relaying partys work with that, but I am guessing that a well-programmed relaying party usually should be able to check for both (the primary and secondary) certificates so that there is a grace period for switching? Or am I totally wrong here? I'd like to bring this up to the service's support if this rollover handling is something they can fix on their side, but as I said, I am unsure if this even is a \"bug\" or just regular behavior with other partys as well.\n    submitted by    /u/itnever3nds  \n [link]   [comments]",

As it's a part of the Desktop Installer package which is from the store it can only seemingly be deployed on a 'per user' basis.

The Auth Proxy's validation checker says my setup is good to go.\n I found old posts about Fortigate firewalls not playing nice with Auth Proxies on different network segments. I saw that setting a source ip in the Fortigate firewall might help. No dice. Still fails to connect to my Duo Authentication Proxy's radius server. My IP addresses and secret key are definitely correct. \n I'm wondering if port 1812 is being blocked by my Fortigate firewall. Per nmap, port 1812 is \"filtered\" on my server running my Duo Auth Proxy. When I test disabling my Windows Server Firewall and scan again, I'm told port 1812 is closed. I see no obvious firewall rules allowing/blocking port 1812.

In addition, they set the VM session count limit to 20, with 32 gig ram and 8 cpu per VM. \n Firstly, I think the specs are way overkill, would you agree here? \n Second, the amount of bloat software on these VMs seems a bit ridiculous to me. A design to have non-persistent VDIs, regardless if they are RDSH or win10, should really not even have SQL, python, ODBC, and all this junk on there, that is designed physical endpoints or persistent VDIs. \n Thirdly, I spun up a few hardened VDIs with a baseline image, 2 CPU, 8 gig ram. Someone decided to upgrade all of my persistent VDIs to 4 cpu & 16 gig ram, because “users were complaining”, because they are Power Users that use SQL, PBI, etc. \n while azure monitor clearly shows a lack of resources even being used. \n Am I going crazy here? Thoughts?\n I’m thinking about redoing the multi-session gold image from scratch and doing it the right way. Rather than keeping whatever non sense this MSP did.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Hearing3804  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys. I’m a new sys admin at company that just got rid of their senior sys admin a month before I joined up. We’ve got 4 rack servers all operating as hypervisors and a storage server(Synology NAS with a bunch of HDDs). 4 LUNs were created on top of these drives and each LUN was mapped via iSCI to each hypervisor, all the VMs boot and run from these LUNs. Also got a Microtik cloud router switch that connects all the Hypervisors to the storage server(1Gbps connections). \n My question: is this an optimal set up, having multiple VMs on each host sitting on LUNs? Is it best practice? If not how may I possibly improve it? I’m willing to rebuild everything from the ground up if I have to. Any suggestions would be appreciated! And yes I definitely plan to reach out to experienced sys admins to help with doing the actual set up but figured I’d also see what y’all think about this. \n P.S During a recent power issue on one of the hosts I realized that all the VMs lost connection to the storage server and for some reason the iSCI connection kept hanging without reconnecting.. this wouldn’t even be an issue if I was running the VMs locally (buts that’s just my reasoning anyway)\n    submitted by    /u/-zazu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Posted this r/intune but figured I'd put it here as well in case anyone can offer some insight: \n I have a hybrid environment with a fair few devices. I put 30 Windows 10 devices in an Update Ring for W11 but only 11 of them seemed to upgrade. All the devices were on and syncing with Intune.\n I had the Active time set as 08:00 to 18:00 so updates should automatically occur outside of those hours, right?\n I even had \"Restart Checks\" set as \"Skip\" since these are desktops (No worries about battery) and some of my users only \"Lock\" their PC and do not actually Sign Out. I wasn't sure if this would be detected as \"User Presence\" or not.\n The next day, I actually manually dialled into some of the PCs and did \"Check for Updates\" and the W11 update was there (Along with the Cumulative one for some but not all) and started installing and I was prompted to restart to finish the installation.\n The pie chart on the overview page isn't much help. It only shows there were errors with 4 of the PCs but upon clicking it, it shows each of the four devices on there twice, once as \"System Account\" once as the UPN of a user (I suspect the last ones to log in on the device). For the record, none of the devices have a primary user set on Intune. It even says \"Succeeded\" for each of the devices even though they were still on Windows 10.\n Any idea what I'm doing wrong here?\n Also, is the actual \"Downloading\" of the update happening outside of the active hours as well? In an ideal world, I'd want the update to Download/Install (Same as when you do \"Check for Updates\") during active hours while the user is logged in (To save on time), I'd just want the force restart to happen outside of Active Hours or if the user chose to do \"Update and Restart\" or \"Update and Shutdown\". Not too fussed about this however for now since I'm only deploying this to 9-5 users but will eventually have to deploy it to PCs that are used 24/7 with only random 1-2 hour breaks in between use.\n    submitted by    /u/RealAgent0  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need something that can scale, reprovisioned quickly, and has direct hardware access (GPU abd PCI devices).\n My laptop has pretty good specs (16 cores, 32Gb memory, and 2 TB storage one M.2 SSD and one SATA SSD).\n I want the 2 systems to share one partition as a data partition. For example i can store virtualbox VMs on that partition and be able to use these VMs on both windows and linux.\n I am currently reinstalling both systems to clean them up because I was installing alot of programs and stuff to learn and it is now too much to be cleaned, I also neee to repartition the drives with different sizes, but its not fun at all, takes alot of time and effort.\n SO, I was thinking that I can use my laptop as a virtualization server (with proxmox for example) and install both my systems as VMs and have all the advantages that proxmox offers with managing these VMs and their resources). But I am not sure how user friendly will this be for me, and what are the limitations of such architecture? \n I appreciate any suggestions or if you have other good ideas for my setup, this might become a thing in the future :)\n    submitted by    /u/DynamicResolution  \n [link]   [comments]",

More work is thrown at me, and expectations are high. Customers emailing me constantly for updates, but I don't have time to research since I am trying to meet these god damn SLA's which my response quality has lowered significantly. So new clients are not getting my best, current clients want their stuff to be fixed NOW and each day I am stressing knowing I am bound to get more new work. I'm tired. I asked for a few days off in July a couple weeks ago, all of it denied. \n I enjoy working in the cloud, and scripting but I am getting burned out and I feel it. I feel so much stress. I struggle to sleep. I've always had my shit together, but each day I feel like I am losing control. I don't even get paid much for the stuff we do and am willing to go back to help desk with a lower pay for now, just no more stress. Hell, I even applied for simple sale's jobs. I don't know what to do anymore to be honest. Market also sucks kind of. Been getting interviews and make it to the last round but always get the 'We have decided to move forward with other better candidates. Good luck'. I want to quit so bad, but I only have enough money to get me through the next 3 months without working.

As a result, much of the work is done by me when it really shouldn’t be. I’m in school, but lack a lot of formal training. I’m more or less just the “guy that knows computers”.\n A user reported to me that their HP printer did not work. This is a printer that only this one user uses, and has never had any issues before. I try to print and the computer says there isn’t even a printer connected, so I look and it’s not showing on the network. I add it directly by ip, but jobs still won’t leave the queue. So I check the printer itself and it can print a test page just fine when I do it from the printer. I figure it’s a driver issue, so I get the newest drivers from HP’s site and it finally works!\n The problem comes when I report to my senior that I solved the issue and how I did it. This kind of thing usually does not get a reply from him. However this time he called me on the phone, which is SUPER out of character. He sounds super angry. He tells me that “printer drivers haven’t changed in 40 years.” And that we just needed to “direct the traffic properly next time.” He goes on to explain to me that this was a “big no no” and that future printer concerns should be directed to him.\n Where did I go wrong here? Like I said I’m not formerly trained, but I’ve never once heard anyone ever say that there was an issue with just getting drivers from the official source for a printer. I also did not really understand what he meant by directing the traffic.\n    submitted by    /u/AdditionalPossible99  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use MS Office 2021 Standard and Exchange Server 2019.\n I have made PS script which replaces data in .HTM template and puts it in Signature folder for each user in GPO. Then it calls Outlook.exe to apply signature for user.\n The problem is - my signature is made in MS Word as table with text and images. Images are hosted at imgbb and placed in HTM code. When i open Outlook and apply signature it says that it cannot load images from the source.\n My suggestion is that Outlook is blocking external links with some security policies or it cant handle images as links when applying signature to Outlook.\n My questions are:\n 1) What can i do to make images work without creating other files/folders rather than .HTM file? I have tried manually replace images in code with base64 encoding but it didnt help. Maybe i can generate HTM signature template with some external services.\n 2) Is there any other way to generate signature for Outlook users?

Hypervisor wise I'm running dual Xeon Gold 6354s and Enterprise SSDs and NVMe drives. I'm using GPU-P for vGPU and currently are supporting 2 VMs with a RTX A2000 12GB. For profiles I'm utilizing FSLogix Profiles which are stored on one of the Hypervisor NVMe drives.\n My primary issue comes from RDS performance - my primary RDSH is currently configured with 20 VPs set to 100% reserve and 72GB Ram - this supports around 11 users. And it is slowwwwwww. Users are complaining about performance and when I log in I see it - it's ridiculous. \n However, I check the monitoring software (I use Veeam One and ProcMon) on the hypervisor and the server is SLEEPING! I've spent weeks scouring the internet for clues and I've tried several things but all of them have returned very little progress. \n Would love some input or guidance on what I'm doing wrong - I suppose the Virtual Switch is a problem (just tried swapping to SR-IOV today) but still not getting the results I should expect.\n    submitted by    /u/wtf_com  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently installed a fairly decent APC UPS here at my building, along with the NMC card, which I have set up to send me email notices if there are problems. This is working well. \n Shortly after configuring all of this I started getting fairly regular emails regarding the UPS switching to battery due to both erratic power, and low voltage. I've been investigating possible reasons for this including contacting the power company. A couple weeks ago I found out that a tenant in our building (warehouse units) has a welder that they use occasionally. I went down and talked to them, explained what I was seeing and they agreed to let me know the next time they were going to use the welder!\n Today, they called me and let me know they would be using it in the next few minutes, and indeed the notices started rolling in! So this really does seem to be the cause of the issues that I'm seeing.\n My perception is that if this is happening regularly, then something needs to be adjusted and fixed otherwise I can expect less life out of my UPS. That said, I'm not an electrician and I have no idea what could possibly be changed or adjusted to try to fix this. I know at least that the panel my UPS is on is separate from the panel the welder is hooked up to. But I would guess that they are both hooked to the same service connections back in a common point in our building. I feel like the guys with the welder are willing to help figure this out, I'm not worried about who pays for what at this stage or getting them to pay it. What I am trying to find out is what could be done on a technical level.\n Does anyone have any thoughts? Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Connection-Terrible  \n [link]   [comments]",

Luckily its not more than like one or two per client for the clients affected. \n I know end users aren't getting notifications as I got a user to help me out. He has a One Plus phone and they have a nifty notifications history feature. He let me comb through his notifications (Luckily it was a device he purchased exclusively for work so there wasn't any personal stuff) and sure enough not a single notification of an MFA request outside of ones he requested which I verified through the sign in logs in Azure.

Like one from Germany and the log says: \n Authentication requirement: Multifactor authentication\n Status: Success \n I'm really confused on how this is possible tbh. Initially my first instinct was a SIM hijack but that wouldn't affect the authenticator. Just to cross it out we've been having affected users call their carriers and nothing out of the ordinary.

But, the thing is that he isn't really experienced in web codes, so, I worked on a way to backup the web sources everyday and manage them.\n Thus, yesterday I compressed a 29Go folder in a 14Go folder in 1h20. I used bz2 to compress the folder and a 14Go archive looks decent to me to keep it for 1 day. But, the process has taken 1h20. This bother me because its a web server (even if it was a 4AM) so the sites performances are getting slowed during this time. The command I used to backup everything is this one :\n tar -cvjSf archive.tar.bz2 web_folder\n Does anyone know if I even can maybe make the process a bit faster? Any suggestions are appreciated :)\n Note, from the graphs I checked, the processus doeens't look this overloaded (60% during the backup) but the RAM looked saturated.

For context, we used the AWS Landing Zone accelerator to set up our environment and added several workload accounts to their own OU. Our company also uses Azure AD, and I can edit groups. \n For each workload account (there are currently 10 and will be more), we want to have both dev and admin roles per account for users to live in. With this in mind, I thought of 2 options for AD/SSO integration:\n OPTION 1: Creating a user group for every role and account, meaning that there would be a dev and admin user group for every workload account. The drawback to this approach is the higher number of user groups to manage, but we could utilize AWS managed policies. \n OPTION 2: Using AD attributes (ABAC) to create custom permission sets that define a user as dev/admin, so that there only needs to be 1 user group per workload account, and dev/admin roles are determined through ABAC. The drawback to this approach is the initial set up of custom policies, but it results in less AD user groups to manage. \n Which option would you go with, or are there other/better alternatives?\n    submitted by    /u/optimum_hello  \n [link]   [comments]",

While I noticed several valuable packages like Hyperbackup, Active Backup for Business, and others, I have encountered some issues:\n  \nThe Synology server is not very powerful.\n Some packages are not frequently updated, so I resorted to using Docker.\n Configuring some Docker containers seems to be particularly difficult on DSM.\n  \nTherefore, I am considering setting up a second server where I can install an OS like Unraid or TrueNAS to manage the media server and act as a redundancy for the Synology server. This way, I could use the Synology as a reliable and secure solution while having fun with other containers on the second server. Do you think this choice makes sense? Additionally, I'm thinking of buying an HSGT HC550 18TB HDD for the Synology since I found a great price (€250). On one hand, I would like to take advantage of this opportunity, but on the other hand, I don't want to waste money if I don't have that much data to store.\n I also have two spare 6TB SAS HDDs and a friend's R720 server that I could purchase at a low, symbolic cost.

The username is abstract (think U2123651213132@acme.com) so they want the username to be saved by the RDP client.\n  \n However, at logon time, it drops the last few chars of the username and fails logon. It tries to logon with U2123651213132@acm in one user, and U2123651213133@acme.c in another user. If they correct in manually, it works, but I don't understand why it \"forgets\" a part of the user name. I've never seen that before.

Please work with your domain administrator to ensure that the cluster identity can update computer objects in the domain.\n  \nNow, I've only seen this error posted with the \"Access is denied\" code, which usually is resolved by, well, fixing the access permissions that the CNO has on the other resources in order to update them. However, I fail to find anything mentioning my exact error with the incorrect password of the CNO account and a suggested solution for it.\n I've had a look at this with an external party suggesting we still work on the permissions the CNO object has in AD, giving it full control. But I like to avoid just tossing permissions at things hoping it works, especially because this error does not suggest a permission issue.\n I have found the following article, although without my error mentioned, but it makes the most sense (atleast for me) for the issue I'm facing: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/failover-clustering/understanding-the-repair-active-directory-object-recovery-action/ba-p/371891\n This suggests taking the Cluster Name resource offline and using the Repair feature, as this will apparently use the credentials of the currently logged on user to reset the CNO password and replace it.\n I'd like to have a second set of eyes on this, maybe someone has even had this issue before already.

Our print server is running on a 2019 Server Core VM. I can install the Universal Print connector service just fine, but I can't register it with Azure because it wants to open a browser to handle the sign in process.\n On the other hand, the connector service for Azure AD's SSO agent handles this registration process via Powershell. I can't remember which, but I believe I've also encountered one that prompts you to open a MS login page on your workstation and gives you a code to enter. \n I feel like of all the services to run on Server Core, a Print Server is high up there. It seems like laziness that the only reason the Universal Print connector doesn't support Server Core is because it doesn't have a browser to handle logging into Azure to complete the registration process. There's even a Powershell module for managing the connector (such as adding printers to it) after it's been registered! The UP team needs to talk to whichever team worked on the connectors for those other services and copy their registration process.\n Another one that seems lazy to me for similar reasons is the PowerBI data gateway. Once it's registered, I've never seen the need to interact with it again. It SHOULD be able to be run on Server Core but once again, it doesn't because rather than create a registration process via PowerShell they went the lazy way and required a browser based login.\n    submitted by    /u/Matt_NZ  \n [link]   [comments]",

I see various recommendations by searching but nothing definitive. \n  \nDelete the saved state, reduce the memory size (currently 29 GB) and boot up. Delete unnecessary files and expand disk size. Restore memory back to normal or…\n Delete saved state. Copy the VHD to an external HD, boot the machine to that. Delete unnecessary files and move back… expand for a permanent fix.

They’re legitimate, just extremely tenacious and annoying. I tried to look for a trend in them, so we could set up some rules to just delete them, but they don’t seem to follow anything scalable and they’re addresses are always different. \n I looked in the exchange online portal, and the anti spam rules all seem like they’re for strictly malicious spam. I might be wrong, but I felt they wouldn’t be helpful. \n I suggested that they just used the OWA to setup their own block/allow lists, but they can’t be bothered and wanted IT to do something about it. I’m kind of at a loss here. Is there anyway to get them out of this hole that I’m missing? Blocking the sending domains could be an option, but not all of them are things we would want to block. Like Glassdoor or legitimate recruitment sites that they and others might use. The worst is when the solicitors send meeting invites, they’re getting placed as tentative on the calendar.

Reviewing the messages, it is pretty clear one of the vendors involved in the email process had been compromised. \n The email thread looks normal. The vendor requested and sent an invoice for payment on equipment.\n Two days later there was another follow up urging the payment quickly. The vendor also requested a change in ACH information. You can clearly see the email domain changed at this point and the language has the feel of poor translation. To me there were red flags at this point and had I been involved I would have urged a phone call to confirm the validity of the message.\n Another recipient on the thread from another company involved in this large purchase even doubled down on the payment request. Technically he was fooled too.\n So technically our systems were never compromised. But we are the victim since we made the false payment.\n Whose insurance gets involved here? I assume next step is to report this to the authorities. (local FBI cyber field office)\n Our company has traditionally not taken any of this seriously. I have managed to secure much of the infra a bit at a time with MFA, good AV and better policies. But my scope of oversight has never been able to influence finance and other at risk departments.

Interestingly, opening a TERMINAL and typing \n >arp -a\n does not show that IP address in the list.\n However: >sudo arp -a -d\n cleared all entries, and now it works.\n If anyone else finds this problem, think of ARP similar to DNS:\n DNS will take a domain name (dell.com) and translate to an IP address.\n whereas ARP will take an IP address, and translate it to a MAC address on the local network.\n So: proxmox.domain.local = 10.0.0.17\n and 10.0.0.17 = e3:d4:ac:f4:39:0a\n And this ARP table on the MACBOOK had the incorrect MAC address.\n clearing the ARP cache with >sudo arp -a -d\n cleared that table and let the MAC re-ask where that IP address was.\n Thanks to everyone for troubleshooting! \n    submitted by    /u/AustinGroovy  \n [link]   [comments]",

HR is impotent as they've said they don't want this happening but it continues. the VP above has made promises to 'put a stop to it' yet it continues. \n this is but one in a litany of examples of this toxic and abusive behavior, and an opportunity came up, so i took it. might recruit the rest of my team to come along...

          "description": "Hi all, Do any of you have a clear DR plan for what to do if an admin account in your Azure tenant is compromised?\n As I see it, a single forgotten service account could result in all other admins passwords' changed, and losing access to everything in Azure/M365.\n In my on-premises environment, if I have a set of backup tapes for all my data sitting on a shelf, I can (theoretically) always wipe all devices to bare metal and have everything restored, including identities, in the time it takes to copy the data. Cloud is not so simple. * Azure AD itself can't be restored, at least not with the same identities. If you lose control of a tenant, any identities are gone. And if you use Azure AD login and Intune with Bitlocker, your devices are all now wiped as well. Any configuration that depends on application configurations or managed identities needs to be rebuilt. Even UPNs wouldn't work, since you can't add the same domain onto a new tenant. * VMs in Azure can be backed up by any backup agent, but what about PaaS? If you're relying on Azure Backup/ Site Recovery, you just lost that too. Are there any good options for backing up files or blobs in Azure storage accounts? What about databases? Or Azure Key Vault? Azure Automation? * If you're using Azure services, you should be storing all your environment configuration in a code repository. But is it really all there? Have you tested a rebuild? And if you're using a cloud repository and logging in with Azure AD SSO, I have some bad news for you..... * For Office 365 data, much of it can be backed up, but can it be restored in a new tenant? Even tenant-to-tenant migrations with access to both tenants are spotty. In a new tenant, any identities are gone, and any permissions or groups would need to be rebuilt.\n Is there any product out there that claims to be able to restore your entire Azure estate, or should I just throw my hands up and hope it doesn't happen?\n    submitted by    /u/ProMSP  \n [link]   [comments]",

All workstations are Windows. No Azure AD in place.\n The problem is: Some end users that will need to be migrated to the new domain work remotely (not down the street remotely, but sometimes a few states away remotely). These users connect to resources over VPN, but the VPN authentication is tied to the domain controller that is going to be decommissioned.\n At some point during the migration the authentication of VPN is going to have to be redirected to the new domain controller. What I’m trying to nail down is what’s the best way/best sequence of steps to get all the devices on the new domain with the wrinkle of VPN being tied to the old one?\n There’s only about 15 or so people I’m dealing with, not hundreds or thousands. So even if the process is a little tedious, that’s okay. One thing I thought about is just switching the VPN (temporarily) to authenticate using some other method besides VPN before the migration starts, but I’m trying to see what all my options are.\n TLDR: upgrading/replacing domain controller, some users are offsite so their devices would be joined over VPN, but VPN auth is tied to old domain/domain that is going away.

If i hover up and down on them the digits change to their neighbour value.\n This happens only if i RDP into the RDS-Server. If i connect via Remote Control Software, even in User Support Session i can the original text, no errors.\n This could cause devastating consequences. But i am not sure how to troubleshoot this error.\n Did you expierience a Bug like this?\n We use RDP UDP Shortpath, i disabled it temporarily but that didnt help. I think it could be a problem with some kind of Compression happening via RDP. But why after FSLogix Update..\n Should i contact Microsoft Azure Support about that? What would your next steps be?\n    submitted by    /u/jimstar95  \n [link]   [comments]",

They do everything including print a Welcome Guide and put it in the box before shipping to the users. We execute about 5,000 deployments per year. We are looking to bring that function in-house. Among the considerations for us is how to make the best use of our physical office space when prepping 100s of laptops per month. I'd like for us to be able to \"gang\" all the laptops together in a dense physical arrangement and have access to the console via a KVM (keyboard video monitor) switch. \n Is there a KVM that has dozens of ports that you may think about for this type of arrangement?

I'm trying to figure an issue out and usually my google is on point, but I can't for the life of me figure out where to start with the search. \n We have multiple scan workstations on windows that need fast access to a NAS, producing thousands of folders with images on a daily basis. Current setup is old, not compliant with what we should have. Single user for all pcs that has domain admin and thus way too many rights for what that pc actually needs. But if I use a user without domain admin rights, the folder access speed to the NAS goes down dramatically to the point that a folder containing e.g. 80k subfolders doesn't pull the list fast enough for our software to work, thus crashing the workflow. With domain admin the entire folder is listed in a second or two, without it takes minutes to list.\n I'm at a loss what exactly handles this kind of file access and thus far only found out that domain admin grants the access speed and it's my goal to remove domain admin from that setup. Anyone kind enough to give me pointers where I could start looking?\n    submitted by    /u/Ark639  \n [link]   [comments]",

But if you’re running a bunch of open source stuff that your cousin built, you’re saving some hard dollars but probably costing way more in cost of someone babysitting that rickety stack, security risk of something configured wrong, etc.\n Anyway, I’m clearly doing something wrong because it’s hit or miss on getting folks to agree.\n How do you guys present your “business case” for tech upgrades like this?

Since the original announcement, they've had 2 chances to setup their budget for the year to include the migration but many teams have just not bothered. We've gotten little to no support from our leadership even though we've been hit with a huge, multimillion dollar cost to keep extending support and licensing. They know we're leaving and are stuck, so they can stick us on the way out.\n We've alerted everyone to the fact that we are no longer doing updates to the platform and any security vulnerabilities need to now be tagged against the teams who refuse to leave rather than ours. We've also notified everyone that support goes away at the end of this year, even though we're already so far behind that we aren't supported anyway.\n What else can we do? I'm expecting our leadership to expect a Hail Mary if there is a production impacting outage even though we're ending up so far out of support it'll be a nightmare to fix.

I've asked for a few quotes from a few resellers and they all came back generally the same. I expected that, its not that many devices, and negotiating regarding Apple equipment seems to be a non-question in general at this scale.\n The deployment is for only remote employees. I'm wanting to setup an MDM and ensure maintenance and processes are defined, tested, and documented within the two months I have to complete the project. I'm at the stage now where I can order some devices from a reseller I've been working with and make sure the auto enrollment and deployment works.\n My boss now wants me to look at a few other vendors to verify we're getting the best possible deal. I explained my concern regarding it being more important that our setup is clean and efficient in terms of management and deployment, but was told to hold off ordering anyways. Even at scoring something like 10% off its only going to save ~$2500. The idea that I have to redo my work with another vendor to integrate with ABM and setup drop shipping, waiting for the confirmation on their side, etc. to save that amount of money makes it sound like the more expensive option.\n Want to hear the perspective of other people and see what they do/how they would handle this.

The smaller site, lets call it site 2, with one DC and just five workstations had an issue over the weekend apparently, each workstation this morning after logging in had an error that they were connected to a new network and asking if they wanted to enable network discovery. Some said yes, some said no, some just left it.\n None of them can access the server by server name \\\\server2 and of course they only app they use accesses the server by server name.\n Did some testing, they can ping the server IP and it resolves, they can access the shares by IP address. Same thing is happening on the DC in this site. This also happens if they try to access a server by name in site 1. Everything in site 1 is fine by the way.\n Kerberos Event ID 4 is showing up on the server and the workstations. Did the suggested SPN duplicate search but didn't find any duplicates.\n What I did find was if I tried to ping the domain name it would return an IP address other than the server. It is actually just an IP address from the DHCP pool and not actually assigned to anything. This was happening on the server and the desktops.\n I went into DNS and removed that entry. At that point the server in site 2 started working and could access its own shares by name. Workstations could not so I rebooted them with no change. Rebooted server and it still works and so do a handful of the desktops. Some of the desktops still give the error and can't access by name.\n They give the same event id 4 in the event viewer with the name of whatever server we try to access. Ping is working on these workstations for both domain name and server name. IP and DNS info all look good. Not sure what to try to get these other workstations going.

You can only browse work-related news, log in to your profile to check your salary or remaining vacation days. And here lies the problem because employee data is generated in PDF format.

Or is it the other way around?\n Are there specific regions in Canada where infrastructure opportunities are more abundant?\n How has the demand for infrastructure professionals is evolving, especially in the cloud field ?\n  \nPlease feel free to share your observations, personal experiences, or any valuable insights regarding the infrastructure job market in Canada. I believe this discussion will not only benefit me but also others who are navigating their career paths in this domain.\n Thank you in advance for your contributions and expertise!\n    submitted by    /u/Starman0812  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey there, Reddit community! \n Today, let's talk about Optimizing airflow and cooling in server racks. Here are some practical tips:\n  \nOrganize cables: Proper cable management improves airflow by preventing obstructions. Use cable trays and ties to keep cables tidy. \n \nHot and cold aisle containment: Separate hot and cold airflow paths using physical barriers like curtains or panels. This enhances cooling efficiency and prevents recirculation. \n \nRack placement: Ensure sufficient space between racks to allow for proper airflow. Avoid clustering them too closely.\n \nBlanking panels: Cover empty rack spaces with blanking panels to optimize airflow and prevent recirculation of hot air. \n \nRegular maintenance: Clean or replace air filters, check fan operation, and perform regular maintenance to prevent dust accumulation and ensure proper cooling. \n \nVentilation options: Choose racks with perforated or mesh doors for better airflow. Consider adding fans or ventilation units if necessary. \n \nTemperature monitoring: Use environmental monitoring tools to track temperature and humidity levels. This helps identify areas needing additional cooling or adjustments.\n \n Remember to share your experiences and insights in the comments. Let's discuss how you manage airflow and cooling in your server racks!\n    submitted by    /u/Timik_Enclosure  \n [link]   [comments]",

No need to wait days for a quote\n Reporting: I've created a system that generates the final reports immediately when the test is done, need to wait 10 working days for a final report..\n Crowd Testing: Some clients want several penetration testers to have a look at their targets but most pen testing companies can't accomedate that. With my setup, I can assign as much as 10 penetration testers to each project\n 24 Start: I've setup our penetration testers and team in a way that allows me to start a penetration test in 24 hours no matter the time of the year.

I have been working in the web hosting industry for over a decade and currently hold a position as a Technical Support Staff, specializing in Linux System Administration, for a well-known company. It's a great company with excellent management, and I have a very supportive supervisor. Overall, I love this job and excel at it.\n However, I feel that the compensation is not sufficient, and I am considering relocating to another country in the near future. I understand that my current salary may not be adequate in the new location.\n My expertise lies in web hosting support, particularly with cPanel, DirectAdmin, and related areas. I would like to broaden my skill set to pursue a higher-paying job. If you have been in a similar situation, I would appreciate hearing about the field you chose and any advice you may have regarding additional skills I could learn alongside my current role. I also have proficiency in Bash scripting and troubleshooting WordPress, and I can develop basic websites. However, beyond that, I have limited experience. I have attempted to learn a few programming languages, but given my age (currently 32), I am uncertain if programming is the right fit for me. Are there any other areas I should consider learning alongside my Linux System Administration and Technical Support role?\n I appreciate your time, opinions, and any advice you can provide.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/ahtshamjutt  \n [link]   [comments]",

The biggest downside to this, is there is no way to track what is being done.\n I had the idea of using our MFA solution and CrowdStrike Identity. What my idea was, grant users admin rights to their local machine, but put a policy in place that makes them confirm an MFA prompt from DUO when elevation is requested. I still don’t think there is a way to track what is being done, but I can track who is using admin rights, and how often. \n I’d love to discuss what everyone’s thoughts are or if there is an even better way to handle this?\n    submitted by    /u/tectacles  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm consoled in now, router is not dead, good. But WAN interface is down. I can see LAN is up then I notice another port that is up and is not configured.\n Check logs, it came up about the same time the WAN went down.. I ask the tech to move what ever is in that port to the WAN and.. boom, sites back up.. someone had literally moved the WAN cable into another port!! WHY?\n I tell the tech to ask them who has been in here (comms room) today, who was in here at the time network went down, why are they moving cables.\n The site managers response was \"well the wifi was running slow and that happens sometimes and what we do is we just move this cable from one port to another it comes good again\".\n WHAT\n No, seriously, in a technical sense it is completely impossible. I even reviewed config backups for a sanity check. There has only ever been one WAN port.

It just sits on the spinning circles forever although you can access file shares on it during this time and some other functionality is working.\n I've checked the logs and a large number of the services seem to be timing out while starting. There doesn't seem to be a pattern though and they are all kinds of different services covering different things. When the server finally does boot, the following services are stopped:\n Distributed Transactions Coordinator\n Diagnostics Policy\n Network Access Policy \n But if you click to start them, they seem to startup without issue and once it finally loads it all runs without issue and seems 100% fine.\n The server has the Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, DHCP, File/Print and NAPS roles.\n It's an absolute nightmare to debug because I make a change then have to spend 45 mins waiting to see if it works.

          "description": "Hello. Seeking opinions. I'll keep out some of the details to keep it short. I need to get a redundant/backup internet carrier at a very important site for our small/med enterprise. It is a warehouse location. The wrinkle is that we are leaving this site in approximately one year, but up until that time it is crucial that if one ISP dies another is available. Our current provider is actually the cable company, who has an enterprise fiber division. The only other provider in the building is the legacy RBOC who has fiber.\n I have been getting quotes through a telco broker who works with multiple different companies that use the RBOC as the last mile/loop, but they either refuse to quote 1 year or the pricing is very high (over $1000) even for speeds like 50 or 100Mb. I have looked at satellite internet services which seem too slow. I have looked at 5G broadband, but my hesitation is that they seem to offer no guarantee as to speed or performance. The fine print literally says there is no minimum speed. I need at least 50Mb up and down to run the business in the event of a failover. Another option is business (not enterprise) class cable modem, from the same provider as my current service. I inquired about redudnancy/separation between the two services, they did not get too deep into detail but admitted that they did potentially share some of the same equipment.\n So what would you do?\n A) Get the wireless broadband service, and hope it doesn't suck horribly when needed\n B) Get the cable modem and hope the services don't ever go down at the same time\n C) Bite the bullet and try to convince ownership that we should pay the $1000 per month for the backup service, which is more than we pay for our primary service. The internet in this location has not gone down for at least 5 years, but if it did and we didn't have a working backup it would definitely cost the company more than $12,000 if it was down for a day.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/moneydontjiggle4sure  \n [link]   [comments]",

This function is no longer available in the classic admin center.\n I know it's a minor annoyance and yes, I do use powershell more often than not to accomplish some of these tasks, I know Microsoft is gonna Microsoft but some of the changes are just so annoying.

(or an auto-detect feature built into the vpn client)\n ​\n What I was thinking was:\n  \nThe VPN client when connected would work as its supposed to with routing policies and things of that nature\n When the VPN client is not connected it would monitor traffic based on policies and rules and when it detects that the system is attempting to connect to a resource on the destination network that is only available through VPN it would prompt to connect\n The idea is that people would be able to stay off the VPN and only initiate a connection when its required.\n Further it would reduce IT helpdesk tickets because rather than logging an IT ticket when they can't access a resource, only to find they haven't connected to VPN, the client application would pop up with a notice \"looks like you're trying to connect to your workplace, would you like to connect?\"\n The user could click yes or no and if they click yes then it would initiate the connection sequence (prompt for password, mfa, etc.)\n  \n​\n what do you guys think? let me know in the comments\n    submitted by    /u/roblu001  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For those of you who had admined Teams phones, you'll know that even with autosign in there are times the devices sign out. Users press buttons, bad updates happen, or in some cases they just seem to randomly sign out. Every teams admin I've ever talked to usually starts by confidently saying they don't have that problem before coming back later in the conversation and saying something similar to \"Well we did have a few devices sign out but that was because the password expired\" or similar. \n If you're familiar with Kari's law the basic premise is that there can be no barrier whatsoever to dialing 911. If it's a phone, you should not have to dial an outside line or take any special action to dial. But if you look at a teams phone, every single one says \"Sign in to make an emergency call\"\n How is that legal? I genuinely do not understand how, or how people are getting around this. Surely if an organization is using teams as a phone system with physical phones they're non compliant with Kari's law? \n What am I missing? Even with auto sign in there isn't a way to 100% guarantee a phone wont get signed out. \n I get that there's other issues here that need to be addressed. The need for cellular backup in case the internet goes down, or backup power for the phone system. And yes, I fully understand 'most people just use their cellphones', but I'm specifically wanting to address teams phones in this context because the way I see it, there's no way to be compliant with Kari's law unless you have someone physically checking each and every phone multiple times a day, even if it's in the hallway rather than being assigned to a user.\n    submitted by    /u/breenisgreen  \n [link]   [comments]",

We've used RANCID in the past but viewvc has been giving us fits for a while and Oxidized looks pretty cool so I decided to give it a shot.\n I installed it on Ubuntu and I got it to the point where oxidized is running as a service and I can see the configs it's capturing but I've been unable to get nginx working to access it on the web. If I'm understanding it right (and I may not be), Oxidized is running a local web server on port 8888 and nginx is supposed to listen on port 80 (and 443) and then reverse proxys web traffic to the oxidized site.\n Right now when I go to the server on the web I get a 502 Bad Gateway message and I'm not sure what needs to change. I'm pretty sure it's something in the nginx.conf or sites-enabled/default files but I'm not sure.\n Here's the current (sanitized) contents of my /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default file: https://pastebin.com/Dx2jrEDU\n And here's the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default: https://pastebin.com/KfGnJk16\n Like I said, I'm not a Linux guy so please take it easy on me :)\n    submitted by    /u/MScoutsDCI  \n [link]   [comments]",

There you can select the option to apply the keyboard shortcuts/combinations to the remote computer, instead of \"Only when using the full screen\".\n I figured I would share, because I mentioned this to some of my teammates and they didn't know about this setting either.\n Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the Gold award!\n    submitted by    /u/Need_no_Reddit_name  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also, from what I can tell it's exclusively an image-editing solution, so the imaging part of the process still has to be done manually via making bootable USB drives with Rufus for example. I don't believe there are any similar solutions out there that can for example, image devices on the same network from a image repository stored on local storage?\n We have a number of clients with no on-prem server hardware that have fairly unique, extensively-customised OS images with a plethora of industry-specific software on top of that, and they are an absolute time-sink to reimage whenever one of their PCs/laptops is having issues and/or they purchase new hardware.\n    submitted by    /u/Severin_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "\"Have you tried turning it off and on?\" is a common thing IT guys get made fun of for saying, but I mean we kind of deserve it. If it works, use it! I think it's funny that other professions ALSO turn it off and back on, they just don't want to call it that. Like once my mechanic told me to fix an issue with my car we needed to unplug the battery for an hour and then hook it back up. I said \"So ... turn it off and turn it back on?\" and he was like \"no, no, not like a computer\" and I just said \"suuuure.\"\n Well this weekend I learned a new one. Saturday evening my heart started racing for no reason. I put on my wife's FitBit and my heart rate was 124, well over the 80 it should have been. I ended up in the ER, and told me my heart was in AFib. Normally when you heart beats, the top part of your heart beats first, then the bottom part beats. In AFib the top part of your heart doesn't beat, it just kind of flutters. For me this meant the bottom part was beating much faster to try and compenstate. \n I had to have a procedure, and the doctor described it as \"We are going to put a tube down your throat to get a better view of your heart, then we are going to give you a drug that will stop your heart for a moment, then we will shock your heart to get it started again, and it should start beating normally.\" I said \"So... turn it off and turn it back on?\" He didn't know what to say so I said \"It's ok, I am very familar with this process.\" \n So there you have it fellow nerds. There is nothing that can't be fixed without turning it off and turning it back on.\n (FYI, the procedure went well and my heart is back to normal. Also I ordered a smart watch that can detect AFib.)\n    submitted by    /u/letowyn  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's pretty obvious I'm being targeted due to my title. Nobody else at my company is getting these calls. I never requested any info from them either.\n I've already told them we use a different stack and aren't interested in changing. Datadog is WAY too expensive for us already and I've read enough billing issues and \"getting bit by the dog\" posts on this subreddit dealing with DD on top of that.\n I mentioned that there is one monitoring element I haven't found solution for (big mistake). I work in the robotics industry so I threw him a question about if they had solutions for ROS monitoring. He said no. Ok so I tell him I'm not interested and hang up.\n Two weeks later I get an email from the DD sales guy saying he discussed my needs with a developer and wanted to see if i was interested in what they came up with. They basically began trying to sell me on software that was hacked together after 2 weeks and wasn't even listed on their website. I'm good. No thanks.\n Months. no more calls. Ah peace.\n Today. The cycle has started again. Maybe a new guy. Idk. Told him I'm not interested. This time I keep my mouth shut about ROS.They obviously still don't offer it publically. He sent me a calendar invite anyway. He said if you can't make it or if you're not interested, just cancel. Fair enough.\n Ok, so I just cancelled that meeting. Now I'm getting emails about me cancelling and trying to reschedule. \n I don't get it. I don't want your software. I already said no on the phone and email multiple times and cancelled your meetings. I have an option to reschedule too but, I didn't.

All issues have to be answered within the 0-2 hour SLA, including those reported by slack, jira ticket, email, and phone call. This is in addition to our normal 8 hour work day.\n The volume of calls generally isnt that bad (2-3 per day), but its the SLA bit thats chapping my rear a bit. To meet this expectation I'd have to set an alarm on my phone to wake up and check slack and Jira every 90 minutes or so. And on top of that we are to answer any helpdesk calls that come in regardless of time. \n Aside from the question of legality in my state (I'm asking a friend who is a lawyer about that), I wanted to get the opinion of folks on here.

However over the years I have found that users will generally tell you a problem only for you to try it and it works. There have also been times where you make a change on the network, something you think won't be affected is affected and you undo that change. Instead of explaining the process of what you did (because either the user wont care or understand) you say, it's fixed. Or there have been instances when you kind of made a stupid mistake and instead of admit your mistake, you quietly undo the thing and the user is puzzled as to why it started working again. \n I have been in IT for about 15 years in numerous roles and still carry a passion for it. I will passionately explain things to people if they will listen.

Many managers, including my own, hinting that it would be a shoe-in \n 3 days leave, came back and was off sick with gastric flu for 5 days.\n Found out yesterday that they filled the vacancy without telling me it had gone live or asking if I wanted to apply\n Questioned it with him, oh it’s a totally different role, no it’s what I’m actually doing right now!😡\n So here we go again trying to find a perm role. Starting now, because I feel as (late) middle aged white dude, without a huge amount of cloud experience, the tick boxes are against me.\n So fed up of it all. 🤦\n    submitted by    /u/Wiz-Was  \n [link]   [comments]",

We would like to manage them (print queues, permissions etc.) remotely using printmanagement.msc run from an elevated mmc.exe. When connecting to one of our print servers (Windows Server 2019 systems), the account is immediately locked out.\n I can see no unusual events when this happens (4769 [requesting kerberos service ticket], 304 [granting kerberos service ticket to a \"Protected Users\" member] and ultimately 4740 [account locked out]) and can't think of a reason why this would happen.\n Have any of you seen this before?

          "description": "Hi all,\n I've got a real head-scratcher here. We have a user called Tim (not his real name) who's calendar seems to be causing some major problems for other user's Outlooks clients. When the other users have Tim's calendar added to their list of shared calendars, their Outlook grinds to a halt and uses 40% of the CPU and causes total system instability. Every 5 seconds or so, it says \"updating Tim's calendar\" in the bottom right before disappearing again. This continues constantly as it was affecting one user for over a week until they reported it.\n The only way to fix this is to remove Tim's calendar from their Outlook completely - simply unchecking the box to display it doesn't work.\n The weird part is not everybody who has Tim's calendar has this issue, it seems to be 3 users out of about 10 who need access to his calendar. But all users who have this issue have Tim's calendar in their Outlook, so I'm fairly certain the issue is actually to do with Tim's calendar rather than the user's outlook clients..\n So far I have tried; • Quick and full repairs of Office on both the user's and Tim's devices • New Outlook profiles for both Tim and affected users • Removing all offline and cached items from Tim's Outlook calendar • Checking Tim's calendar for any recurring meeting going for excessive lengths of time\n I'm honestly a bit lost as to what to try next so any suggestions are greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/bawta  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately, some stupid colleagues use it to chat to each other, also creating groups. Now that the HR noticed it, they want me, as the IT admin, to disable the chat for everyone.\n I think that this approach is not the right one, firstly because there are a lot of people using the chat in the right manner, and secondly because a tool like Teams doesn't make sense without a chat, for me.\n Now the question. Is there the possibility to restrict in some way the ability to create groups for some people or to talk to each other? I really can't disable the chat for everyone, otherwise our dinosaurs colleague will continue to use the email as the tool to chat, send files, etc.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/davidecenedese  \n [link]   [comments]",

We usually work on call in a rotation, work from home that week, and we are able to monitor everything and work for OT pay. Now its being rumored that they will not pay OT rates, still want us to work afterhours/on call, but their fix is to let us leave early, which is just offensive. Is this a standard across the board? Is this legal? When my rotation comes up, if I am asked this I don't think I can comply honestly, because it does not feel worthwhile to have my whole week sidelined, and potentially working afterhours (usually i hit a few calls but probably around 3-5 hours extra during my rotation) at my base pay, just wanted some kind support or some kind of resource or baseline so I know what I am potentially going to be walking into.

Here's the thing though: my workplace does not abide by that whatsoever, and it is intentional. \n I've been trying and failing to clean up our SCOM environment since like March. \n Every time I've approached my team and my boss about turning off an email alert that isn't actionable, I'm always met with \"no, leave that on, I'd rather get the email than turn it off\". \n Every single person on my team receives hundreds of non-actionable alerts every single day. If you need information from a specific timeframe, you check your email alerts. Right clicking and 'mark all as read' is an every day occurrence. \n Sending a message in Teams that says \"you're about to get bombarded by emails from what I'm working on, just ignore them\" is an every single day occurrence. \n When we patch, we get thousands of email alerts that we have to sort through the following Monday every month. \n I've tried telling my team that these alerts can be condensed into dashboards in SCOM where the information is just as accessible and your inbox stays clean. But they'd rather receive the emails. My boss is extremely clear on her stance that she'd rather get hundreds of non-actionable alerts per day and manually sort through them. \n Do other places actually not do that? I'm putting a lot of effort into learning how SCOM works and how we can organize the data from SCOM to not rely on constant email spam.

As someone with no prior experience in this domain, the vast amount of information available can be quite overwhelming.\n Overall i'm looking for a not too expensive setup to monitor our racks with a motion sensor and camera. \n We rent multiple racks in different data centers, and our manager wants us to monitor these racks 24/7. The monitoring system needs to operate effectively in various environmental conditions, such as cold/hot temperatures and low/high light sources. Ideally, we'd like a camera to activate and record video on one of the rack's servers when motion is detected. Additionally, we plan to dedicate a VM to manage the camera(s). Our requirements are relatively straightforward; we primarily need a camera to record any access to our equipment. \n I've come across several recommendations from other sysadmins, with APC solutions being frequently mentioned. The NetBotz Camera Pod 165 appears to be a suitable camera option. However, I'm unsure if it can be used without a NetBotz rack monitor. I've also noticed suggestions for the Unifi camera solutions.\n Those solutions are extremely expensive for what we need to do. \n ​\n  \nWould it be possible to simply use a webcam managed by the VM ? \n  \n​\n  \nAre there good open-sourced project you experienced sysadmins are using for this particular use case scenarios ?\n  \n​\n  \nWhich camera / webcams would be best suited for simply monitoring access to our racks? \n  \n​\n I'm truly fresh out from school, we've done some image processing projects in python so maybe in the worse case I could improvise a cluncky script that launches everytime the VM boots up ?\n Apologies for the novice question, and I greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations you can provide.\n Best regards,\n Ben\n    submitted by    /u/Ben_TrotFox  \n [link]   [comments]",

Whenever I try to publish my instant-clone image, I encounter the following error message in Horizon:\n \"Publish Error:\n Fault type is AGENT_CUSTOMIZATION_FAULT - Internal template vm-542704 customization failed. Error description not set by agent.\"\n I've already attempted a couple of troubleshooting steps, but unfortunately, the problem persists. Here's what I've tried so far:\n Removing AV software: I thought that the AV might be interfering with the publishing process, so I temporarily uninstalled it from the system. However, this didn't resolve the issue. See here; https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90781 \n Using sysprep instead of clone: In an attempt to overcome the customization failure, I switched from using the clone method to sysprep. Despite this change, the error message still pops up.\n I'm now at a loss for what to do next. Have any of you encountered a similar error while publishing instant-clone images in VMware Horizon 8? If so, I would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have to help me resolve this problem.\n Thank you in advance for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/neoengineer_  \n [link]   [comments]",

At my company, Head of IT has always encouraged me to grow. In my performance review last year, he said he wanted me in a sysadmin role by Fall of this year. My company offers a bonus/certification program that pays for and gives bonuses for passing certain exams. So I have been taking advantage of this program and getting the certs as others have done. Others have gotten these certs and no one has ever batted an eye about it. In the past 2 months, I have been doing a lot of studying and got 4 certs on our in our certification program. On the last 3, my boss has been really slow to respond about them and follow up with HR/Finance so I get the bonus. Now, after my last cert I got, he emailed me back quickly saying to stop getting certs for now and he needs to talk to the CTO about it. Someone on my team got the exact same certs and they were praised for it, but when I do I am told to stop? I am just trying to grow into the role that I want at this company and I am confused as to why he wants me to stop my growth. I mean I understand if he doesn't want people taking advantage of the bonuses and then leaving, but I have been with this company the entirety of my career in IT (I am young so not that many years). \n I understand I am in a unique situation and I don't know if other companies offer things like this. Any advice? Am I overthinking? Should I ask him about it? All feedback is welcome. Thanks for reading.\n Edit: I don’t believe that it is budget or cost related. There have been other people in the past who have gotten certifications that grant bonuses that are double mine, and they were encouraged to keep going.

We’ve been whitelisting the few public IPs for port forwards to our ordering and provisioning systems and creating the tenant/admin account and allow those businesses/admins to complete all their own onboarding for their users. This is quickly becoming not scalable though. We are planning on setting up an SSL Web VPN page on a Fortigate with bookmarks to the individual services they need to access but trying to find a solution for the Fortigate VPN accounts. \n Ideally we would create the single new admin account for the business and then allow them to create all their own users as they hire/fire. Trying to figure out the best solution for a Radius/LDAP server for the Fortigate to use for authentication that we can configure each tenant on and allow them to build/remove users without seeing the other tenants obviously. I tried to look at FreeIPA and it’s use of realms but that doesn’t seem to work as I expected it would. \n Our current internal Radius server is just TACACS fed by a MySQL backend which is fine for us to run SQL query’s for the couple of user changes we have per year but that’s obviously not ideal for this B2B use case. \n Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/g4m3r7ag  \n [link]   [comments]",

The original vulnerability, CVE-2022-21894, was patched in January, but the new patch for CVE-2023-24932 addresses another actively exploited workaround for systems running Windows 10 and 11 and Windows Server versions going back to Windows Server 2008.\n The BlackLotus bootkit is the first-known real-world malware that can bypass Secure Boot protections, allowing for the execution of malicious code before your PC begins loading Windows and its many security protections. Secure Boot has been enabled by default for over a decade on most Windows PCs sold by companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, and others. PCs running Windows 11 must have it enabled to meet the software's system requirements.\n An attacker who successfully deployed BlackLotus on a targeted system could obtain complete control over the OS boot process—giving them “almost the same capabilities as firmware implants, but without having to overcome the multilevel SPI flash defenses…or the protections provided by hardware (like Intel Boot Guard),”\n https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/microsoft-patches-secure-boot-flaw-but-wont-enable-fix-by-default-until-early-2024/\n https://www.itbrew.com/stories/2023/05/26/the-first-ever-zero-day-to-fully-bypass-secure-boot-on-windows-may-take-until-2024-to-fix\n    submitted by    /u/jpc4stro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand this is a time of complete chaos for a lot of companies and onboarding in our field is always a bit sink or swim, but this is well beyond what I'm used to.

Dual Juniper switches, setup in a virtual chassis config - each model being 48 port 10GbE with 40GbE interconnects.\n In a small setup (3x VM servers and 1x SAN), why not do this? The switch can handle different MTU/Jumbo Frames per port, VLANs etc (so all storage networks can be on their own VLANs). In the virtual chassis setup it means no chance of config differences between switches. Controller A of the SAN could go to Switch 1, and Controller B of the SAN could go to Switch 2, so full redundancy.\n The VM servers would have 4x ports per server - 2x of which would be for VM traffic and their associated VLANs, and 2x would be for the SAN traffic. Again would go between switches, so a single switch failure would have no downtime.\n Can anyone give a good argument on this setup on why this shouldn't be done?\n    submitted by    /u/Efficient-Junket6969  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have three VMs:\n FS Windows 2019: Network Adapters\n  \nDCComm [for 'Domain Controller' Communication only] - 192.168.5.15/255.255.255.0/192.168.5.2)\n  \nMy DC: Network adapters \n  \nDCComm (192.168.5.10/255.255.255.0/192.168.5.2))\n MyPVT (Communication Between Clients and DC) (192.168.4.10/255.255.255.0/192.168.4.2))\n Ethernet (Auto Assign IP)\n  \nMyClient: Network Adapters:\n  \nMyPVT (192.168.4.150/255.255.255.0/192.168.4.2))- Used to access the Internet, through the DC\n  \nThe idea is to use Group Policy Management Console on MyDC to create a folder and copy files to MyClient. I tried first by using a share on my host network, which did not work. The share was going to be USB attached storage from a router, and my DC could not see that.\n I then created a second Windows Server 2019 PC strictly for file shares (detailed above as FS Windows 2019). I deliberately put those on another network (using another virtual adapter) , thinking this would prohibit direct access by the clients. Both DC and FS servers can ping each other, and my DC server can access the share folder on the FS server, but Group Policy is not copying over the files. The folder created correctly.\n To create the folder, I'm using the path: User Configuration>Preferences>Windows Settings>Folders and created a folder here with the action being to Update.\n For files, User Configuration>Preferences>Windows Settings>Files. Same thing, I'm using the Update action.\n Again, the Folder creation worked, but the file copy did not. Why not and how can I fix this?

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n As the title says, I'm wondering how much ram does your company computer have? I'm talking here about the general computer, not the specific one that have special requirement.\n I'm currently on Windows 10 with 16gb ram for the majority of my task force. The CAD users have 32gb.\n I recently made an in-place upgrade to W11 and saw that it use quite more ram. Idle, I sit around 6 to 8gb of ram consumed. This made me think I might have to upgrade everyone to 32gb (or 24? I feel this is an odd number).\n ​\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/nodiaque  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n we have a fair number of people departing in a few months (education environment) and so we'll be disabling their AAD/Microsoft 365 accounts soon. I've been asked if it's possible to export all data (Onedrive for business/Outlook/Teams messages/Sharepoint Online sites etc.) for some of these users, in case they want to access it in the future.\n As I've stated, since this is an education environment, none of these users had access to any data that would be considered confidential, secure, or anything like that. From what it looks like, there's no way to export this data, neither from their end, nor from the admin center. I did find something about using eDiscovery to do it, but we don't want to use additional licenses or software to do any of this, especially since this won't affect our operations at all. If need be, I'll just tell the users to export their messages and download all their files manually, but seeing as many of them have upwards of 50 or even 100 Sharepoint sites (mainly due to MS Teams, but also manually created groups), I can't imagine this will be wildly popular.\n Ideally, we'd like to know of a way for the users to be able to export their data by themselves, but I imagine that probably doesn't exist, so is there a way to do it from my end without requiring a ton of manual work?\n Thanks in advance for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/krystof1119  \n [link]   [comments]",

I fully expected this to be a softball (I was hired on as a level one guy), and that my VP or anyone in our C suite would have posed this question at the beginning of our contract. \n My rep paused for a moment, knowing our situation with Intune, our current DC, etc. He basically said we might as well not even finish this call, and mentioned how little time we have. My heart sunk.\n Since starting at my company I have been trying to get us onto a more modern platform, one that is easier overall for our users.\n With all that being said, doing double MS e3 licenses for 7 months is a non starter for our leadership. \n Problem: we have ~650 PCs on old DC, most of which are remote and our VPN solution is a) sophos ssl b) not widely used\n My proposed plan: New DC: All new/current gen pcs are enrolled We redistribute devices on new domain Users continue to use old e3 resources on devices (office licenses) until we are ready to roll out name change and new tenant\n We have to be out of using our old name and tenant Jan 1\n My question: is there any easier way than this?\n Just about anything is on the table as long as I can tangibly point to a labor savings, and make it as easy on our users as possible.

I panicked and started troubleshooting. The server was up and running, and the network was fine. I didn't know what else to do, so I blamed our vendor. I sent them a WhatsApp message: \"Hey, what did you guys do? We can't access our ERP.\" They replied, \"We didn't do anything.\"\n I was at a loss. I continued troubleshooting, but people were starting to get angry and impatient. I remembered that our domain had expired on May 28, 2023, and today was June 2. The domain provider had auto-renewal enabled, but it was attached to one of our directors' credit cards. I called him, but he was still asleep. After 16 minutes of trying to wake him up, he finally renewed the domain. He mentioned that he forgot to change the card detail. \n I waited patiently for the domain to come back up. My phone could access the ERP, but my laptop still couldn't. I was about to start troubleshooting again when one of my managers said, \"Have you tried restarting DNS?\" I did, and it worked!

I've debated calling in and using a sick day, but I've refrained from doing so for two reasons:\n 1) It wouldn't help me feel any better. When morning rolls around, that's it. I can't nap during the day without completely spoiling sleep the next night unless I'm actually sick. I'm not going to be able to do anything, so I may as well feel miserable and get paid instead of feeling miserable for free.\n 2) We've got a small team, and I wouldn't want to let them down. I really like my compatriots, and if I'm out then my share of the work gets dropped square in their laps. If I can grab that phone call from the capo di tutti capi, that lets everyone else keep their concentration on what's important.\n I know that these sound contradictory, but it's a matter of taking the smaller tasks that don't require as much brainpower - stuff I've done a hundred times and is mostly muscle memory at this point - and either passing the challenging stuff off or sending bland updates that extend my deadlines.\n Basically, I'm asking for advice/anecdotes/etc. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/FrecciaRosa  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sent other emails recently to new addresses with attachments and they replied no problem. The only thing I can think of is maybe his I.T. admin has Outlook spam settings set ridiculously strict?\n I set up mail open/click tracking, which may help a a little (assuming receivers don't have images blocked by default), but still curious why this may have happened.\n Thanks and I appreciate any ideas you share\n    submitted by    /u/tlatch89  \n [link]   [comments]",

I connected the machines one by one (first the first port from controller A to the first host, port configuration on the device, then the first port from controller B to the first host, port configuration on the device, and then the next server). Connections look fine. From these hosts, I created a FOC group on the hpe msa 2050 and mapped the drives to this group. Then I set up a cluster failover on Windows Hyper-V 2019. Cluster passed the verification without errors, disks from the array connected without a problem, migration between machines works fine, but one thing worries me, when I run the get-initiatorport command in powershell on node 1 and node 3, it shows me nothing, while on node 2 it shows me all connections. It seems to me that on each server should be visible two connections and not all on one host. \n Can someone confirm to me if the configuration on HPE is good or has anyone encountered something like this and is it normal?\n    submitted by    /u/tasiorr11  \n [link]   [comments]",

Once added we then enable passwordless phone sign-in. The app displays a two-digit number which is entered in and then the phone is registered. The app shows that passwordless sign-in is enabled. However, when a user tries to sign in for the first time, they receive a message stating 'something has gone wrong on our side'. \n Phone sign-in is then disabled and the user needs to re-enable phone sign-in to try again but this process seems to repeat after every login attempt, and we are unable to see why in the sign-in logs. \n Users have either a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license or a Microsoft 365 Business Standard + Azure Active Directory Premium P1 License.

          "description": "Hi gang,\n Apologies if this is not quite on topic. We have an internal application. One function of that application is generating PDF reports generated in Crystal Reports from data in an MSSQL database. This is a fully automated process, no interaction required.\n At present the function calls an SQL query, gets a list of reports to generate, then starts generating them one at a time before 'printing' them to a PDF file with the file name changed. This function currently utilises PDF995 which is slow and at times unreliable.\n This application (currently 32-bit written in VB4) is about to get an update to .NET and as part of this transition we want to move away from PDF995 and to something else we can 'print' a PDF to and specify the output file name as part of the process.\n Wondering if anyone here has a similar set up or knows of one, and can recommend a replacement software product. I'm open to anything be it subscription or a once-off, as long as it's regularly maintained and patched. TIA.\n    submitted by    /u/brettfk  \n [link]   [comments]",

This one and the main server are connected to a managed switch and both systems are in the same vlan. We have this setup at two different locations, only using different parts.\n At one of the locations, we discovered that network speed in that vlan slows down drastically when the backup server is shut down. After a lot more testing, we found out that this problem occurs with any NIC that is connected in 10Mb/s mode (tested 3 different systems, turned on and off, and manual 10Mb/s and 1000Mb/s mode, both full and half duplex, same problem every time). It's a KGS-1604 switch from KTI Networks. At the other location, using a TL-SG108E from TP-Link, we couldn't reproduce that behaviour.\n Sure, we could just replace the switch, but we're just some 10th graders from Germany, doing some tech stuff mostly for fun and getting some knowledge in IT along the way, therefore we don't exactly have a lot of budget. Most of our hardware was gifted to us or bought very cheaply from neighbours.\n But even if this is not fixable, we would like to know how this could even be?\n ​\n EDIT: Yeah time to say goodbye to that piece of shit, thanks for your advice guys, guess I learned a lesson today: NOT to buy THAT old hardware, no matter how cheap it is.\n    submitted by    /u/Leonzockt_01  \n [link]   [comments]",

The TSC ticks at 2800 MHz, and 2800 * 10**6 * 1042.5 days almost equals 0x380000000000000, which has too many zeros not to be a coincidence.\n Note that your server will almost definitely hang, requiring a physical (or IPMI) reboot, because no interrupts, including NMIs, can be delivered to the zombie cores: this means no scheduler, no IPIs, nothing will work.\n Either disable the CC6 (as you did with the Zen CPUs IIRC), or just reboot the damn thing, it's been three years already, you're missing out on a lot of security patches.\n Please read erratas before you start digging, it'll save you at least a day of debugging :(\n    submitted by    /u/acid_migrain  \n [link]   [comments]",

They don’t want to use PIN and only a password and I’m not sure where PIN requirement came from.\n I assumed it was due to Windows Hello for Business feature in Azure AD so I disabled it. Only 7 computers have been set up with a PIN and I’m trying to switch back to passwords.\n The computers are unmanaged in Azure. I have tried disabling all policies on affected machines that have anything to do with a password (Logon PIN, Windows Hello for Business). Also disabled “sign in options” registry key.\n After doing all that upon login certain users are still prompted for a PIN.

Now we need to really revisit how we have structured our AD OUs in a much better way. From a top-level OU structure, we are planning to have the DC site location with the structure as -\n Site-Location:\n OU Level 1- Building/Office \n OU Level 2 --Department\n OU Level 3 ---Users/Computers\n We have some challenges here and not sure if the above structure will work:\n  \nSome buildings/offices may have a mixture of different departments that exist in other buildings/offices in the same site.\n Some users may be in multiple departments, so should we create all department containers in all buildings/offices as a pre-step to avoid extra work in the future?\n Some \"special category\" computer group policies we have applied to specific department machines which should not apply to all departments, would it be wise to create OU Level 4 for these machines? Specific policies are for example: Exceptions to Windows Screen lock-out, Allowing phones to be tethered to CPUs, Allowing USB access. This would create the GPO mapping side to be a little more tedious for us. So trying to prevent as much work as possible here.\n  \nAny suggestions on proper structuring from AD Veterans would help.

I don't have experience working on a team this big. Which really sucks and shouldn't really be a factor. I have 11 years of IT/sysadmin and web dev experience.\n I've been a jack-of-all-trade type for about 9 years between two companies and my consulting on the side. I also have sales b2b experience for 4 of those years. I know how to pick up systems and processes really quickly and easily. I am currently teaching myself full stack development and cybersecurity concepts (since I want the CISSP by the end of the year). I have always been employed and am a good worker, yet these recruiters treat me like some unemployable person.\n The problem seems to be that I don't have a structured IT career progression and a lot of it is self taught. Mostly because I was the guy the incompetent managers hired to fix things. Yet somehow I am not getting this picture across to recruiters or they don't believe me when I say I work well with others. I know that there is some disconnect between my experience and what companies are looking for. I do believe it is the fact that I have never been in a company that was larger than 500 people. This seems to have hurt me in my job searches. Even though there was diversity, teamwork, irate end users and all that comes with any IT job.\n Is there any advice out there for a sysadmin who is looking to gain exposure to technologies at a large company? I am not dumb and I can handle sysadmin work, but why do the recruiters not want to hire you if you weren't in THAT specific industry?

Everything else is identical, even the email signatures. There was also about 10 other emails copied so at first glance it's not really noticeable. After reply this was followed up by we changed banks, plz see attached for new banking info and then accounting paid it...\n We use o365, mfa is enabled and we even do semi-annual training with knowbe4 to be aware of this type of stuff. Now IT is being asked to investigate but honestly there's not really much we can do from here. The spoofed domain was recently registered and all the mail records are setup correctly so it slipped by all the scanners. Email also had a warning in the body that we add to be cautious as this is coming from outside the company. \n Now we are wondering how a scammer intercepted the communication and was able to phish it. We've seized everyone's laptops that were involved and locked their accounts. So far nothing suspicious, no message rules, no unknown logins, no malware. We are wondering if it's on the vendors end but even if it is I don't think you can really hold them responsible\n I guess this is just a warning to ensure your user base is well-informed about phishing. If anyone has any tips let me know. They are already trying to reverse the transfer but it's been weeks since it went through. They didn't even know until the legit vendor followed up a month later and said the balance was still unpaid. \n Said vendor also isn't a small fry and is a multi-billion dollar global company.

He covered me when I took trips, and was my backup when I needed to bounce ideas or troubleshooting around.\n I, the net and sys admin, do 95% of all IT related tasks, and we lost our low level techs over a year ago, but we positioned in a manor where I can pretty much run the place alone. It's not a lot of work.\n Their isn't enough work for two techs of my skill level IMHO, and the management stuff is signaling that the IT reports, etc of the managerial role can be scaled down. \n So, idk what to recommend to the business, and quite frankly I'm stressed out. Can I run the place myself? Sure. Do I want to do that and never get a free thought to go on vacations unbothered, etc. No. But there isn't enough work for two techs. If I brought someone else on we would be twirling our thumbs and it would turn into a revolving door of techs I'm sure.\n What do I do here? Is an MSP an option? Do they help with windows servers, help desk, and Linux servers? I have zero experience dealing with them.\n Do I hire abother tech and we just shoot the shit most of the day? I'm beyond stressed over this, and considered polishing my resume myself but the company really needs me and I really like the people who run it, it would be hard for me to do that to them.\n    submitted by    /u/Fizgriz  \n [link]   [comments]",

I love the trouble shooting part of my job but the long drives to my work place and the physical wear and tear on my body are starting to beat me down. I have an extremely strong knowledge on anything layer 1 and have been working on passing a JNCIA cert. However I feel that may be a waste of time. I am toying with the idea of reaching out to a recruiter and seeing what they could find me and see if any companies are willing to take on someone like me to train up. \n I was originally a fiber splicer technician working ISP and OSP, until I got my current job. However I feel my current title is very undescriptive of what is expected of me. I work closely with our in house Cloud, Neteng, and syseng teams and have picked up small bits of knowledge along the way. I've attempted to move into the department but management of my department has a hard time working well with others and is seeming to be blocking me. I would love to get work that can be WFH at least part of the time as I now have a one year old and want to be around more than I currently am. ( I work 5 days most of the time, 10 hours with 4-5 hours of travel depending on traffic. ) Any and all advice would be welcome.

Due to budget constraints, our migration is slow. We have ~80 workstations and started replacing one every month in July of last year. The reason this is relevant is that we are going to have a mix of MacOS and Windows for a while and processes can't just be switched over.\n Here are a few questions that I have and any advice would be greatly appreciated:\n  \nBecause the office is primarily Mac-based, domain administration tools (AD, GPO, etc.) have never really played a major role except for email (on-prem Exchange server). This gives me the perfect opportunity to rework the domain setup to my liking regarding policies and organization. How have you approached this in the past? \n \nSome of our users have only ever worked on a Mac so they would need training right from the basics on working with Windows. How have you handled user training on the new OS? Are there any good user guides out there that cover Windows 11 from the basics and would be easy to navigate for tech-illiterate users? \n \nDue to the sometimes huge process changes, I find that a lot of users will try to tweak the new processes to emulate their MacOS experience, often making their Windows experience a lot more complicated and increasing frustration. How have you helped users adopt new processes and help them see that the new processes, although different, are more efficient and will make it easier for them to do their job?\n \n I know this is a pretty lengthy post, but I really appreciate any responses to my above questions.\n    submitted by    /u/Altus-  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now we are 4 employees (including me). \n The situation at the workplace\n I am focusing on everything IT-related. They have set up a domain network with 4 windows machines and one windows 2012 R2 server. The employees login through the domain meaning its dependent on the server to work. \n - Every employee has access to the other employees computer (except for mine)\n As some of you know Windows Server 2012 R2 is about to reach its end of life and so does the software we run on it. \n ​\n Suggestions needed\n Why even bother logging in through a domain at all? Why cant I just setup each computer individually with local accounts? Going with a server is just overkill and its just consuming alot of power (and is also getting very warm in my office). The software that the server is providing with the other users basically just needs a visible-over-network folder. Meaning I can just \"share\" a folder in the network with a smaller, not so hot running but modern computer running windows 10 and just share the folder with the other windows 10 machines. \n I think the server solution for us is just too much work and pointless in our current situation. Are there any concerns about turning the logins of my employees into local accounts?\n I didnt know who to turn to and reading this reddit has helped and inspired me alot for my workplace and I really hope it fits with what the community is about\n    submitted by    /u/PrinceHeinrich  \n [link]   [comments]",

But neither currently support sending out either SMS or phone call alerts to an on-call engineer (and we can't wait to see if they are building it). If everything else was A+ I would accept app/push notifications, but using the mobile phone network is first choice.\n The reason I bring up those existing systems is because a lot of tools out there (PagerDuty, BetterUptime etc) cover a lot of the same bases as well as the on-call alerting, so we'd be paying a fair chunk of change for features we have no intention of using. I saw a recent blog post about PagerDuty alternatives, but from my reading many of the listed products are covering the incident management portion (like incident.io), but missing the actual alerting via SMS or phone call (out of hours, when we can't expect engineers to be paying attention to the work Slack).\n This needs to be a SaaS solution, because we want to be able to alert in the case that our entire platform on which all our own stuff is hosted is having issues. Given that we're entirely in AWS currently it also shouldn't go down if AWS has issues.\n What products are other people using? Would you particularly recommend or warn against using it, or is it just 'good enough'?

          "description": "Our company is in the process of rolling out MS Teams to the organization. The direction is currently to deploy a MS Team to each department and then use the underlying Sharepoint site that is created automatically for that Team and customize it as their department Sharepoint site. So the department would be able to use the MS Team for Teams functions and open/link to the Sharepoint side underneath for all their departments Sharepoint needs. The Sharepoint would have permissions customized for different libraries and would also have things like Meta tags customized, etc. \n Here is the kicker. Every event, training and MS rep I have ever spoken with has said the cardinal rule of Teams is you do not make customizations to the Sharepoint underlying a MS Team It is more of the engine underneath and you use Teams to drive the car; however, a new vendor we deal with contradicted that and said it is fine and using the underlying Sharepoint is the way to go. So I am doing somewhat of a sanity check. \n So I am trying to crowdsource some real world examples of if/when this will cause issues. My opinion is we should be spinning up a separate Sharepoint site for each department but if I am wrong I would like to know know as well so I can grow. \n I did some searching but couldn't find many concrete ways that utilizing and customizing the underlying Sharepoint site for a MS Team would cause issues/break things but I wanted to do my due diligence before we set out down this path if it is the wrong path.\n So I thought I would reach out to the community and see what everyone thought. \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/FinalSysAdmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

A fairly manual task but leads to the creation of the GPO settings locally on the DC of that child domain.\n Now, I'm working with multiple GPOs that are extended, which is nice but I'm not entirely sure if it's ideal. I can't recall where I have read that this is bad practice and I can't narrow down why but I came across this Microsoft AD Design Considerations and Best Practices article that indicates it's a normal thing to do.\n AD: Design Considerations and Best Practices\n Based on the Microsoft article and it being semi-recently updated, I'm assuming that extending GPOs across domains is a normal practice?\n I'm more curious about the performance impact.\n On one of my child domains, I search my sysvol\\child.domain\\policies folder for a UniqueID of a GPO that is extended and I do not find it. This means that the computers need to reach out to the parent root domain for that policy, correct?\n While when I search for a locally created GPO UniqueID within the child.domain\\policies folder, I find it obviously. \n ​\n Any ideas or thoughts on this approach in managing GPOs on multiple domains within the same forest?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/N01kyz  \n [link]   [comments]",

The windows clients received via Intune Putty and a shortcut pointing to Putty containing the IP address for the connection. Now we might have to update the IP address in that shortcut, so the plan would be to deploy a superseding app (the shortcut is deployed via script as a win32 app), but this of course will take some time, and I was thinking if there's a way to improve this kind of update. This time we can't just move the old server ip address to the new one as it will be still needed on the old one.

The only thing that changed on their system was a forced W11 update (not my decision). Whenever a user opens a folder on the shared drive, it's extremely slow and crashes Explorer.exe after that, or it hangs in the \"Not Responding\" state. This behavior is present while in the office or with a VPN from their home network. This issue is not present for everyone, only for a handful of users.\n What I've checked and done:\n  \nChecked that network speeds are fine -> Everyone is getting 100+ Mbps up and down.\n \nChecked that system uptime is not crazy high.\n \nSFC and DISM returned no issues.\n \nCleared Explorer cache\n \nMade explorer run each window as a separate process.\n \nAll Windows updates are installed.\n \nAll \"Lenovo System Updates\" are installed.\n \nUnmapped all drives and remapped them again.\n \nMade sure that Defender are not scanning the network drives.\n \n The only thing that I've found out so far is that unmapping the drives fixes Explorer's slow speeds and crashes. These users rely heavily on these drives for their everyday work (Sharepoint migration is in the works but isn't going to be done soon).\n At this point I'm kinda out of ideas, can't even find anything to try.

I thought of putting a pfsense machine betweek the server and one network, set up 250 subinterfaces on it, then set those as 1:1 nats.

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n We are currently facing a design issue with our Azure Expressroute setup, specifically with BGP between Microsoft (MS) and our Fortinet solution. Our setup involves two connections (two VLANs) from the firewall to Azure, and we have decided against using ECMP for various reasons. Therefore, we require an Active-Passive setup.\n For normal operation, we have successfully configured the Active-Passive setup using path prepending and local preference to determine the appropriate connection. When one of the peers goes down, failover occurs without any issues.\n However, we have encountered a problem during maintenance activities. If Azure initiates maintenance on the primary link, the BGP neighborship remains active, but traffic cannot flow through the connection. Before starting maintenance, MS pre-pends the primary connection. Unfortunately, since we rely on local preference, this pre-pending does not resolve the issue, as the local preference takes precedence over the prepending value.\n We have been attempting to collaborate with the Azure side (another IT supplier) to consistently pre-pend the secondary connection. This would allow us to eliminate the dependency on local preference. However, it seems that Azure does not support this configuration.\n Are there others who have experienced similar issues? We would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this challenge. Unfortunately, we have limited options since MS does not terminate the BGP neighborship during maintenance.\n Thank you for your assistance.\n    submitted by    /u/Tribunus-  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tonight I migrated over one of our lower end environments across to them, all went fine, security rules worked great etc.. the main issue was around a NAT rule I wanted to use for each environment, basically, we have a public address ranges that our WAN external firewalls sit on and an entirely different /27 public routed range that isn't on the same subnet etc.. this range is used on the current t ASA solution for certain environments, I wanted to use the free ones and migrate the ones in use across to the PA's in the end. To begin with I was using a free public address in this routed range to put on this environment along with a catch-all PAT to the outside interface as an alternative. Currently during my testing on one of my test vm's, the outside PAT works fine, however, when I turned on the source NAT to this free public address tonight, traffic dropped and stopped on my test VM! I have no clue why. The rule itself is setup like this:\n Scr zone : inside Dst zone : Internet Scr add : lower end environment range Dst add : any Scr translation : dynamic-ip-and-port to the public ip address object which is a /32 Dst translation: none\n Can someone tell me if I'm missing something here on the PA's?

Compared to the 40Mbps Down 44Mbps Up on our normal ISP line.\n If I do a speed test directly from our WAN switch I get close to 1Gbps.\n The speed is causing 2 issues, the backups don’t complete during the backup window we give it if we let the backups run after the backup window we get reports from users that the VPN is slow. After stopping the backups the VPN speed is much better.\n A bit green here and hoping for some guidance on optimizing this.\n Thank you in advance for any input\n    submitted by    /u/Itsme809  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've worked on this two days now and can't make any progress on what is going on.\n I have an outbuilding linked by an Aerohive wireless bridge. The outbuilding bridge AP is linked to a switch, which has two APs (also Aerohive) broadcasting the access SSIDs. All VLAN 1. If I connect to any of the access SSIDs, I get DHCP, pings, internet access, all good. But if I connect to the switch, nothing. No DHCP. No pings to gateway or other devices even when I have a valid manual IP address on the subnet. \n So maybe the switch is being weird? Nope, put in a new switch, exact same behavior.\n So I thought, maybe the APs are meshed into the bridge AP, or maybe into the main building APs directly? Nope, if I isolate the APs on their own VLANs, they lose their DHCP and connectivity on the wireless networks. \n So what else could it be? Can Aerohive bridges somehow share a link that only Aerohive APs can pick up? Some sort of tunnel? Is there anything I can do to get the wired connections on the switch live?\n To be clear, everything works fine in the main building, e.g., wired and wireless client connect without issue, plenty of available DHCP addresses, no MAC filtering.\n Any help will be greatly appreciated.

When I came into this effort to help a buddy, it was setup already using native Azure VPN gateway/etc.... there's also an Azure Firewall but it's not doing much currently. So the main issue is the distant end with the server wants the client to only come across the VPN using one public IP.... here's the fun part... for Azure VPN DHCP Pools it has to be a /29 or greater... so I can't just issue the client one public and call it a day. Additionally, the S2S VPN is using policy based traffic selectors and as such I can't also turn on NAT to turn a private pool into one \"port overloaded\" public IP. I also apparently can't just slap a NAT Gateway in there because when I attach a private subnet to it, and try to use that same subnet for VPN pool addresses, it throws overlap errors.\n ​\n So I guess in summary..... what is the right design strategy for this situation given the technical limitations (oh and they can't change their end until the next change window next week if we need to try anything, so we're just trying to figure out what we can do from our Azure end for now, if anything).\n ​\n Part of me thinks I should just slap a Palo VM on there, do globalprotect and a site 2 site and let the palo take care of NAT without complaining like Azure has been at me, but palo's are like $6k a month in azure, and part of me wonders if I should be using azure's native firewall in the mix in some way to help the situation or if I'm not using other native features correctly enough to get this straight.\n ​\n Any advice is appreciated, sorry for the wall of text, and RIP my favorite 3rd party reddit app soon =[\n    submitted by    /u/syntax24  \n [link]   [comments]",

In this scenario, the clients provider IPs are decoupled from the egress IP that traffic comes from. (We have several clients that utilize whitelisted only services, so ISP failovers or replacements are challenging)\n I am looking to utilize client managed circuits, not a fully managed SD-WAN where they want to define the circuits, install new circuits, add MPLS, etc..\n ​\n Is this what Fortinet's offering is? It seems their SD-WAN information that I had found was leveraging the central management capabilities of Fortimanager, but still requiring the purchase and licensing of a fortigate firewall at each site. This seems more like \"centralized configuration\" than SD-WAN, so egress traffic still changes IPs and such when circuits fail, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/thrca  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm trying to figure out how to best setup a wireless mesh network network that utilizes multiple gateways in order to minimize the amount of hops needed to reach WAN.\n Say we have a very long linear mesh (bunch of nodes on a string) in a tunnel. For each hop we loose some throughput, so if we only have one router as the gateway at say one of the ends, at the other end we will have much decreased performance. I could setup the mesh such that the nodes at the first third will use router A as the gateway, the next third uses router B and the last third uses router C. This works fine, except we of course get dropped connections every time we roam from one third to another and the routers don't act as a failover for each other. Additionally, the roaming is slower when effectively switching between networks.\n One topology I've thought about it having each of routers A,B and C use another fourth router D as their gateway such that then at least at the connections come from the same place and then perhaps it would be possible to perhaps have a stable phone call throughout the tunnel when roaming.\n Problem is that I'm frankly a little too green to figure this out entirely on my own.

We decided to upgrade to SN2100 to get more port density by using 100Gb optics and breakout cables. \n We configured a SN2100 switch and swapped it in for one of our SN2010 switches. \n This issue we are having is that whenever we connect a host one of the four breakout pairs, the port flaps every 30 seconds. We have configured the new switch port identically to our existing switches and connected to existing hosts that have Mellanox NICs in them. \n When we connect the same 10/25Gb breakout to another switch, we have no issues. We only experience the issue when we connect a host (server or workstation) with SFP+. \n We've used a 100Gb to 25Gb converter with both an optical transceiver as well as DAC cable and get the same results; the port stays up when connected to another switch (Mellanox or other brand) and the port flaps when that same connection terminates into a host (server or workstation).\n During the time the port is up, we have connectivity.\n Any ideas what this might be or what to try next?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/tmcmillan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n Working on an issue that is causing me a lot of stress. \n There are many sites that have been cut over to a new internet circuit successfully. A simple swap of cables and minor adjustments, and they're off to the races. \n There's one site that just won't cooperate. \n We cut over the site, and SLA monitors show 50%+ packet loss. Link itself has been end-to-end RFC2544 tested by the SP with no apparent issues. \n What's more, a backup link that goes entirely unused once the cutover is complete and testing is performed shows the same high levels of packet loss. This occurs only when traffic is pushed over the link; on idle packet loss is 0% across the board. The same behavior can be observed for latency and jitter. \n The existing link is unaffected. Regardless of a lower available bandwidth, it is largely stable. The backup link, if utilized when the original link is in place proves to be of a lower than expected quality when utilized, but it is wireless so there may be more elements causing that. \n The behavior of all monitored connections, including the unused backup link showing high packet loss when migrated to the new link is puzzling. I can only imagine that it would be down to electrical interference or poor grounding quality as I have tested all other elements isolated from one another to ensure it wasn't caused by the site equipment. Some hardware replacements or failovers have been made to no avail. \n The routing, switching, and new circuit are all in the same rack. The existing circuit is wall mounted in the same room. The backup link modem is in another room, but is connected by a single cable back to the rack and is otherwise not grounded. \n Would this be a reasonable element to look in to in order to troubleshoot the issue?\n    submitted by    /u/NotAnotherNekopan  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was working on adding vlans to the ports so that some only had the external traffic straight from the ISP and some ports only had network traffic for an internal trusted network that comes from a watchguard firewall. Everything was working great until I made port 1 (where the isp comes into the switch) a tagged port with the external vlan (999) and management vlan (1). The moment I did that, the switch lost connection to the cloud AND it \"broke\" the internet for all tenants on the old network set up. See the attached network diagram for more details.

For our business, it seems great so far given it can do per-packet flow over multiple connections rather than per-session flow so that we can aggregate multiple connection together for a single client. Being able to have a routed subnet is crucial for us given we host a few email servers, file servers, and websites out of our office. So, if we grab two velocloud devices and place one in our colo in the data center, and one here at our head office, are we able to propagate an IP block we get from the data center over the velocloud to use for our core router at the office? We have VPN connections, and lots of different configurations I'd rather not have to change and would prefer if we could use the velocloud to push us that routed subnet possibly via BGP to our router where it can pick it up.

          "description": "I am testing different network techniques in a lab environment using RFC 2544. Something I can't quite explain is the fact, that MPLS Throughput is about 17% less than IP-Routing for smaller frame sizes (see below):\n IP-Routing: Frames Throughput - 76 bytes 25 Mbps - 128 bytes 43 Mbps - 256 bytes 83 Mbps - 512 bytes 96 Mbps - 1024 bytes 98 Mbps - 1280 bytes 98 Mbps\n MPLS: Frames Throughput - 76 bytes 21 Mbps - 128 bytes 35 Mbps - 256 bytes 67 Mbps - 512 bytes 95 Mbps - 1024 bytes 98 Mbps - 1280 bytes 98 Mbps\n The network itself is really simple and consists of 4 Routers in a ring. The tester sends the data to the input router that forwards the packet over one of the two transport routers to the output router and to the tester at the end and back again. The MPLS configuration was done without special stuff using OSPF as IGP and adding \"tag-switching ip\" to the interfaces.\n Maybe someone can give me a possible explanation\n Edit: Routers are quite old, Cisco 2811 ISR\n    submitted by    /u/ThunderbirdOP  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are looking for a cheap alternative device that can be used temporarily on each equipment when doing interventions so it may not require many ports since it will be removed afterwards, maybe 4-8 ports. I did my research, mostly found that opengear models are pretty expensive.\n Opengear ACM7004-2 has 4 serial ports RJ-45, 4 USB ports, RS232 compatibility and is relatively small but price around $800. I found several models like these on their websites but with LTE which i don't really need. I was searching for cheaper alternatives. For the Opengear IM4208-2-DDC-X2-G, i don't have the price but has 8 ports RJ45/RS232, 1 usbport and has some good security features.\n Lantronix SLB console server has 8 ports and seems ideal but couldn't find its price and much specs about it, the SLC 8000 has 16 ports but seems pricey on amazon around $2000.\n The perle IOLAN SDG4 has 4 serial ports RJ45, RS232 local console port but cost around $1000. Surely there has to be a cheaper one.\n Digi CM 8 Console Server 8 Port has 8 RJ45/RS232 ports and 1 console port RJ45/RS232, i don't have the price for this one but it does feature auth like tacacs and radius.\n So normally a technician would plug in the console server to an existing switch (depending on the brand of the switch, i will have to preconfigure the OOB device to connect to it) and the equipments will be accessible via the switch. Normally most devices in the data center have RJ45 compatibility. What do you guys recommend using for this scenario or if you have used those i have listed or a variation of it ? Btw i've searched most on amazon but there isn't much available. Some websites are genuine but don't list the prices which makes it harder.

          "description": "Scenario: We are going to be installing Netgear switches for on-prem raspberrypis in thousands of locations that sit behind a firewall that we have no control over. We currently have visibility into the rpis, but when those go down, I have to contact the owner of the firewall and inquire about their network status etc which is extremely inefficient. \n Is there any way/what is the best way (I'm thinking quick and dirty because we have a long term solution coming but no one knows when) for me to monitor these switches without making any changes to the firewall and without installing anything on the raspberrypi (I don't have enough clout to get that pushed through). For example, if the switches support SNMPv3 could I send that? Would other network monitoring tools like Zabbix be able to send traffic from behind the firewall? Does it all just depend on the firewall settings? Also, we have one valid IP address to use on their network.\n    submitted by    /u/Careless-Coyote-8053  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Like many people starting out in this field I am from a Cisco background, but in my current place we are an Extreme shop, running EXOS series switches across each of our campus'. MLAGs are in use everywhere possible including all inter-switch trunk links. MLAGs were completely new to me when I started here, but I initially picked up how they work quite quickly, because I was previously using Multi-Chassis EtherChannel's back when I was operating Cisco 6500's in my last job. Lately though I've been tasked with migrating VLANs from old switches onto new switches, and I've run into problems where I've accidentally caused a loop to form by tagging a VLAN on the wrong trunk, which has royally pissed me off because this should never be allowed to happen. This is all because one of the things I've learnt regards MLAGs, at least where I work, is that we don't run any form of STP where MLAGs are used, because the two technologies do not work well together, which for us, means that STP is not enabled anywhere it should be within our campus LANs. My Cisco background has taught me you should never disable STP, and I completely agree. Why the fuck are we doing it like this? I'm angry and fed up of having my human errors magnified because we aren't running STP when we should. Yes, I know there are newer technologies now like SPB but we aren't going to be ripping up our entire network to change that now, no chance. I'm just really pissed off that this is the way it is.\n Is anyone else here an Extreme shop, running EXOS series switches, with MLAGs and STP enabled? \n    submitted by    /u/smartiedude  \n [link]   [comments]",

Remove the VPN tunnel from one of the edge routers and that edge router reconnects back to the pfsense box. Re add the VPN and the connection drops.\n ​\n We have tested each VPN separately and all works fine. Its like - once a edge router talks to another edge router, it kills all non-edge router connections. Very odd. \n ​\n So my thinking is there is some type of limitation in the edge os that is causing this issue.

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm curious what is the general consensus regarding the preferred underlay routing protocol to use in an ip fabric network that is made of 300+ switches ?\n From what i've gathered using a IGP like OSPF seems like the easiest choice given how simple it is to deploy and it would allow you to use ip unnumbered interfaces which reduces the complexity of the deployment. However you would end up with LSA floods anytime there is a topology change, but maybe that is no longer a big deal since switch CPUs and memory have become more powerful nowadays.\n On the other hand there is BGP it's less \"noisy\" allows for better administrative control of the underlay network, however it would increase the complexity of the network configuration although that might not be a big deal thanks to network automation tools.\n    submitted by    /u/ghoststalker2k  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the past I've worked with QSFP-DD and OSFP transceivers that had internal PRBS engines, but I don't know if this is standard for QSFP modules or if that would be a standard feature on the PHY's in a switch, and I'm still trying to parse the CMIS standard.\n Would it be as easy as just getting a switch like the FS S8550-6Q2C, and some different 1310 and 1550nm QSFP modules, or would it have to be done using multiple QSFP28/+ Evalboards?\n I apologize if this is off topic, but we're trying to emulate an enterprise network at layer 1 so I hope it's allowed, and i'll try to answer any questions to clarify things.\n    submitted by    /u/HexOmega10032  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a customer who is purchasing a large order of branch routers and requires configuration before shipping. They have a project where they need static public IP addresses for I think 12,000 devices. They've determined that port forwarding is not an option and of course there is no way to get that many IPv4 addresses. Problem is, the device we have to ship for whatever reason does not do automatic prefix delegation properly. Even if I manually configured router advertisements using the ISP's statically assigned network prefix, it still doesn't route properly.\n After a week of back and forth, finally engineering admits that the product doesn't support prefix delegation for the LAN side and that the only way to configure this is to use NAT66. I'm well aware of how NAT66 works and I'm aware that it serves no purpose in the IPv6 world. I agree that thinking NAT improves security is just silly.\n With all that out of the way, unfortunately I don't have any other options and we have to ship these routers out as working to the customer. I've read the RFC and seen some of the potential negatives of this, but I wanted to see if anyone has a real world scenario where a NAT66 deployment failed or caused issues. I don't know exactly the specifics of what this customer is deploying. Only thing they said was that they wanted 12,000 devices behind a gateway to have a static public IP address.\n    submitted by    /u/noCallOnlyText  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are a WISP and have started our journey into network automation. During Phase 1, we would like to clean up our inventory before building the source of truth, as it has gotten out of control. Our current IPAM and several NMS systems are not in sync, and we don't know how many nodes are actually out in the field. The only information we have is the subnets the nodes could be on.\n The NMS system must have substantial discovery/scanning capabilities and be extensible, as we would like to integrate it with other systems (Nautobot or Netbox). It must also have a really good API. A huge plus if it is free/open source. Any thoughts?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/KitchenBeneficial358  \n [link]   [comments]",

When we disconnect the Cisco stack from the topology, the upstream ISP’s MAC addresses appear on the network a few seconds later.\n Links go:\n Cisco stack (dot1q Po6) -> Dell S4048 pair in VLT (dot1q Po27) -> Dell S4048 pair in VLT (separate domain) (vlan 998 access) -> upstream provider switches.\n The Dell switches use RSTP, PVST+ is not enabled on them.\n Is it possible for the PVST+ BPDUs from the Cisco to be passing through the dot1q links (Cisco to Dell to Dell) and then finding their way to the upstream ISP’s switchports which triggers their BPDU protections?

We currently have an Active/Passive Fortigate cluster in place, however, below the Active/Passive cluster is our core switch which is a single point of failure. My goal is to make the core redundant, I was thinking of purchasing two Aruba 3810M's and stacking them via backplane, however, I have also thought of just not stacking them. Please see my concerns below and feel free to share your opinions.\n Network Diagram - https://imgur.com/tR00ax3\n ​\n  \nI understand that stacking at the core isn't the greatest idea, because of the shared control plane, however, we aren't a 24/7 facility, however, I do like the sounds of being able to update the core switch and not having to worry about the network going down.\n Reguardless if I stack or don't stack the L3 switches, will I need LACP to go from the Firewall to my L3 core switches?\n What's the added complexity with not stacking the switches? I believe that stacking the core switches and making one logical switch reduces config complexity, right?\n  \n​\n What do you guys think, should I stack at the core or keep the L3 switches separate? What protocols/technology would you put in place to achieve this? \n ​\n Thanks for reading my post, I am looking forward to everyone's feedback from the community!\n    submitted by    /u/Mysterious_Ad_474  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or is it easy to find/set what wiring scheme the PSE is set to?\n And regarding Passive POE, disregarding injectors, are they all set to on by default? It seems possible to turn off/on by the user in some models/brands?\n Thank you.\n Edit: Oh, one more thing. Haven't really dealt with POE devices yet but from my understanding of the thing, the POE controller needs power for the POE negotiation before power is made available through the ethernet connection right? Do you guys happen to know where the chip usually gets it's power from when a purely POE powered device is first hooked up?

Can't figure out why, and was curious if anyone here encountered this before or know if its possibly a problem with GNS3 and wouldn't happen on real devices?\n More detail:\n Small network I am currently simulating in GNS3 to learn more about how to implement L2LS consists of 2 spine switches (VLT Pair), 1 standalone leaf switch, and 2 leaf switches that are a VLT pair. OOBM switch in place for VLT backuo links\n I have 2 VLANS i am using to test routing. On each leaf switch I have two docker containers connected to it on each vlan. I am not yet testing any kind of VLT port channel from leaf switches to \"server\" just single connections for now.\n LEAF1-P1 -> SPINE1-P1 LEAF1-P2 -> SPINE2-P1\n LEAF2-P1 -> SPINE1-P2 LEAF2-P2 -> SPINE2-P2 LEAF3-P1 -> SPINE1-P3 LEAF3-P2 -> SPINE2-P3\n SPINEX-P1 are in VLT-PC1 SPINEX-P2/3 are in VLT-PC2 LEAF2/3-P1/2 are in VLT-PC2\n VRRP setup on SPINEs with virtip 192.168.X.1\n On Leaf1 I have a docker container with IP 192.168.2.50 trying to ping the docker container on LEAF2 with IP 192.168.4.51\n When that happens I get 3 duplicate responses.\n Basically what is happening is that SPINE1 (the main VLT/VRRP) gets the packet to be forwarded from VLAN 2 to VLAN4, and routes it appropriately. SPINE1 then sends that packet over VLTi to SPINE2, and then SPINE2 ALSO routes and forwards that packet. So the 192.168.4.51 gets 2x ping request. THEN, the same kind of doubling occurs on the response back ending uo with 4 responses sent to 192.168.2.50.\n Has Anyone seen this before? Is this expected behavior and I am messing up by trying to do L3 routing in a L2LS Network?

          "description": "After a lot of troubleshooting, I figured out our Catalyst 9500 is dropping DHCP helper packets, causing clients obviously to fail. This happens cross vlan, and even cross VRF - so on the whole router. We have isolated and can recreate and verify that the reason is a HDMI-to-IP AV device that is using broadcast. We can through inspection of the COPP control plane policy commands see that the router is dropping BROADCAST (Policier Queue 0) packets.\n I have to say I am a bit surprised to see the 9500 has default only 750pps rate limit for broadcast globally. How are people handling this and making sure bugged traffic, DoS or even just AVoIP devices doesn't stop DHCP relay from working \"globally\"?\n The traffic is not DHCP traffic, it's UDP 192.168.0.1->192.168.0.99, but the L2 destination is ffffff-ffffff. And port is not 67/68. I'm struggling to understand why the Cisco would even queue these packets for CPU handling?\n Anyway, I know I can rate limit the specific client and what not, but I want to know what is best practice for single users like this not killing a several 1000-user network..

Like the title says, we are trying to establish a 10gb link to another site via our ISP. The issue that we have run into is, our 10gb link is active and working, however we are only able to pass 2gb of traffic because all traffic going to the handoff device is coming from a single source mac address. Since it appears to be one source device, our ISPs link policing is forcing a 2gb flow limit. Would the best way forward be to add some sort of load balancer between devices that splits the single flow from the our device into 5 individual flows so that we can appropriately take advantage of the 2gb flow limit?

But from Layer 3 (4) and below. \n So service mesh enters the chat and addresses connectivity but at L7/HTTP. Tunnelling exists through mTLS, and Istio/Linkerd have their way of making this possible. Side-car proxies act as routers on behalf of containers pods and terminate at another side-car\n But what else does a service mesh do? - rate limit (qos) - traffic shift - load balance - filter by http request type - give us tracing and observability thanks to b3-header info (L7 traceroute) \n Of course there still needs to exist a TCP (and below) layer for all of this to happen…\n And DNS.\n So my two questions: 1. Why am I not seeing more Networking Engineers embrace the likes of Istio/Linkerd?

          "description": "Hey all, hoping to get some info from PA experts from this sub.\n I am trying to understand how the self-signed certs on the Palo Alto gateway are trusted by the Global Protect client when they authenticate and sign in.\n Basically with one of our fw setups, the gateway has a cert that is self signed by the firewall itself. When we connect to the VPN, there is no ssl warning prompt for the cert being untrusted. \n I have checked that the root CA (also self signed by PA) is not present on the client machines. \n If this is the case, is there any significance of having this cert setup correctly? Does the client just accept the cert no matter the details.\n I have noticed, that when we first add the portal IP, there is a warning only initially but no warning when connecting to the gateway.\n I tried looking at docs but couldn't find what I was trying to understand here. Any info would be helpful.\n ​\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/matrixrice  \n [link]   [comments]",

The company I work for has the marketing slogan \"single pane of glass\" network management but after reading through reddit feeds, this is a term people are tired of hearing.\n I'm sure most companies don't deliver on that term, making it gimicky and overused, but is there really a valid desire/need to manage through a single pane of glass? Many people I talk to are using 3-4 different vendors, so I'm wondering if it's not really a \"pain point\" to manage a bunch of different dashboards for different parts of the network or if people have just never experienced a true \"single pane of glass\" so they don't know what they're missing.\n For example, i'll hear: we're using palo alto for firewalls, mix of ubiquiti and meraki for wireless, and aruba and cisco for everything else...wouldn't that be annoying to manage all separately?\n Thankful for all thoughts and lived experiences shared!\n    submitted by    /u/CometotheJuniperside  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was wondering what you all use and have used in your campus networks for access switches, how they have been performing, what features they have, and the cost. I've been mainly using Cisco and I have found that I really just need a L2 switch with secure mgmt. If I could find a switch that just has basic L2 features and a few that might not be so common, that would be great. My access switches just provide connection to thin clients, VoIP phones, and printers, so I don't see a reason to spend money on cisco products and licenses if I can just buy something more simple. But then again I don't really know if Cisco is currently the most expensive route.\n Here's what I'm looking for in an access switch:\n -RSTP, (and MST if possible)\n -802.1q\n -LACP\n -PoE\n -SSH\n -SNMP\n Things that would be nice:\n -TACACS+ (or other encrypted mgmt aaa)\n -802.1x and or MAB support\n -HTTPS interface\n Just curious what is out there that might be cheaper. It seems like every time I put a new switch in place I just add the vlans, enable portfast for the hosts, configure username/tacacs, disable services, prune the trunk and if I'm feeling crazy double check the root bridge. I don't need VRFs, VXLANs, or GRE. I definitely don't need BGP or even OSPF lol \n Let me know what you guys use for access switches.\n (I'm currently using Cisco 9200/9300s)\n    submitted by    /u/John_Greed  \n [link]   [comments]",

In order to do so we configured a VRF instance and local-as within the VRF's BGP configuration (it's a special case and normally we do not do this).\n Unfortunately, using this setup our own AS number gets involved in the AS-Path, ie instead of having an AS-Path of 12345 12345 12345 (with prepending), we have an AS-Path which looks like 12345 56789 12345 12345 12345 (with 12345 being the customer's AS and ours being 56789, of course these are not the real AS numbers). The BGP peers do not like this, so they reject it in their BGP filters.\n Is there any way to workaround the above issue with IOS-XR?

As I have the option to standardize our sites, I think using Aruba will still be a good option, but I'm all ears.\n Ethernet or SFP should be fine, I would be looking at deploying 1gb while we wait for hardware for 10gbe connectivity.\n Any suggestions on what I should look into?

          "description": "I've been trying to find a solution to a weird issue I've been having for a few days now, and this is my last hope. I've got a pair of SRX340 firewalls which I acquired in order to replace a pair of dell R330 boxes running PFSense. The goal here is to use them just for an IPsec tunnel into our GCP environment.\n As a precursor, the current PFSense boxes are in operation with one GCP tunnel each, sharing a GCP VPN gateway. When I run an iperf test over them, I can get up to 600mbps per tunnel. Plenty for what I need.\n However, when running a simple configuration in a test environment using the Google community guide for SRX devices, I'm only getting ~230mbps of possible bandwidth over the firewall. To be clear on this example, it's one SRX340 with one tunnel to GCP, dynamic routing, a gigabit WAN connection with a static IP on ge-0/0/0, and I have a laptop plugged into ge-0/0/1 on the device to run iperf3 over. Without the SRX340 in the mix, I can get 930mbps iperf3 over the internet to my test VM in GCP.\n My issue is with the 230mbps number. The SRX340 is rated for up to 733mbps of IPsec bandwidth, and I'm running the configuration given as an example in the Google guide. I just can't seem to break that speed barrier. Am I missing something or is this what I'm to expect out of an SRX340?\n    submitted by    /u/isonotlikethat  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems like it's not possible to say \"vlan 1 is globally Desktops,' for example, and have all org-wide site-specific Desktop prefixes be assigned to, and appear under, the same VLAN object. Is this correct? \n Right now I have (for example) a \"site_vlans\" vlan group for multiple sites, and an individual \"vlan 1\" assigned to each group/site.

Due to it not being seen as a major issue (no tickets submitted, just drive by comments) and we had other big projects in the works, not much was done.

          "description": "Happy Friday everyone, \n So, I manage a hotel's Wifi service. A recent change I made for them was to set their QoS bandwidth cap for their free GUEST wifi network to 10Mbps. After applying the update, I went to the hotels lobbies to test it out with my laptop. Interestingly enough, I'm getting on avg. about 4-6Mbps speeds and I'm also seeing that it will fluctuate from 5Mbps, then burst to 8Mpbs, then back to 4Mbps and so on and so on. I'm assuming this is normal behavior you see when you've placed a bandwidth cap on the wifi network, but I'm not 100% on this. If not, let me know.\n When I'm on the casino floors, I'm getting correct QoS speeds (The property is a hotel & Casino), I'm also seeing burst here and there but overall speeds are right on the money.\n Currently using Cisco WLC3504 with Cisco 2802i APs.\n This might be an easy answer for some of you Wireless Cisco ninjas. I appreciate any thoughts and inputs you might have.\n ​\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/heatseekah  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I am working in a company which develops safety-critical application. The company (railway operator) which uses our system in the field wants us to join their already deployed MPLS network. In this case, we need to share the network infrastructure with other systems like CCTV, IP phone etc. Otherwise we are going to install our closed loop for communication between control center and remote equipments, which is a general approach we have taken so far. Our concerns for sharing the common network devices with other systems are bandwidth, latency and security.\n As far as I know CCTV data is prioritized in MPLS QoS. Can our safety-critic data be prioritized higher than CCTV packets?\n Also in case of a failure in other subsystems, may a technician misconfigure the MPLS router in a troubleshooting process so that our routing configuration also be affected badly?\n I remember that with RSVP, pre-defined bandwidth can be allocated to a specific tunnel, can we rely on that?\n The good side of entering to MPLS network is that we don't need to spend a great amount of equipment cost to deploy our separate network. Also we won't need to worry for failures and maintenance.\n In case we decide to involve to MPLS network, we need some commitments from operator on bandwidth reservation and max latency we are going to experience, right?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/AdventurousComputer0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am hoping to get some feedback on how to improve my HA setup between my active/passive FortiGates, and a Cisco Nexus vPC pair acting as the layer3 core. \n Here is the topology with relevant config:\n https://i.ibb.co/hcmxVTs/Forti-Gate-Nexus.png\n Each FortiGate has two interfaces configured in an aggregate (ports 2 and 4). FortiGate1's ports 2 and 4 are plugged into Nexus1's ports 1 and 2. The same is done for FortiGate2.\n When I added the second Nexus, I initially tried connecting port 2 from each FortiGate into the same Nexus, and port 4 from each FortiGate into the other. However, this caused unexpected behavior. I can't exactly recall what happened, as there were a number of issues I was troubleshooting during this time.\n Fast forward a few months, I noticed Po5 was down on Nexus1, and Po4 was down on Nexus2. I removed these port channels and quickly realized this caused an outage.\n I have an opportunity for a maintenance window this weekend and would like to improve this setup if possible. Would anyone who has implemented a similar topology be willing to expand on their HA configuration?\n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/FitButFluffy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Network is fairly simple with just a handful of VLAN’s, RSTP, DHCP reservations/assignments, and IGMP snooping. \n Now, onto the setup; switch (Cisco CBS-350 8 port switch in a touring enclosure) has just two VLANs active: VLAN 11 and VLAN 21, with VLAN 1 being the native VLAN as per Cisco standard. One PC on VLAN 11, and one device functioning as a ping responder on VLAN 21. \n The problem I’m having is the pc on VLAN 11 is able to ping the gateway for VLAN 21, as well as ping the device on VLAN 21 (though the ping only makes it TO the other device, it is not able to be sent back to VLAN 11). Problem only seems to arise when the PC is provided an IP with DCHP, when the PC is set to static IP in the same range I’m unable to ping the gateway of other VLANs. Feel free to ask any questions about the setup that I may not have answered, I’m sure I missed some things. TIA.\n    submitted by    /u/IShouldntGraduate  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Looking to replace a Netgear GS748Tv4H1 switch that's been in production since 2012. It has worked well (with the exception of a fan replacement a few years ago) but I recently deployed a new batch of workstations that have Intel i225/226 ethernet ports. For some unexplained reason, these computers will show \"Network disconnected\" unless I manually set the link speed to 10Mb. My troubleshooting process has narrowed it down to some issue with the Netgear switch. Anyway, management has approved a replacement switch, and I was rather hoping to find something that has at least some 2.5Gb ports as the PC's with the i225/226 ports all support that speed. Most of the cables have already been replaced with CAT6 already.\n No fancy networking scenarios here, just a single location of 40 or so mixed devices and the only requirement is LACP for the link aggregates on two Windows servers and a NAS. I will have to replace the WiFi setup as well so the 2.5Gb ports will come in handy for that and POE would be a plus but not a requirement. Having researched for the past few days I've come up with these:\n Juniper EX2300-48MP (16 x 2.5 GbE ports)\n EnGenius ECS2552FP (16 x 2.5 GbE port)\n FS S5800-48MBQ (48 x 2.5 GbE ports)\n People seem to have fairly positive things to say about the Juniper and I'm leaning that way (if I can find it in stock anywhere in Canada). However, I'm just wondering if I'm getting myself into a much more complicated situation that requires support contracts and subscriptions to cloud things and other enterprise-y stuff that I don't need. I abandoned Cisco years ago because the beancounters didn't want to pay for the yearly support contract and I couldn't get any firmware updates after that. I did have an account rep at CDW that I would go to for info but seems they're ghosting me. Am I fine just purchasing the hardware or should I really try to find a different VAR to make sure I'm getting everything I need?\n    submitted by    /u/Raquel427  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I feel like I already know the answer to this question. I was having a discussion about design with one of my bosses and I think we are in a disagreement about security best practices and practicality of implementing this type of design. \n I think its normal to have your data VLAN, voice VLAN, WiFi/Guest VLANs, IOT VLAN, server VLAN, and perhaps others as needed. I also think its normal for a lot, if not all, of this traffic to hairpin to the local firewall. This may add a very slight amount of latency, but its worth it because of the added security letting the firewall inspect, monitor, and log traffic. \n I think we have fundamental disagreements about network designs. I think hed prefer everything to be as flat as possible, but that is extremely messy. And makes troubleshooting difficult sometimes. As well as implementing changes on the fly. If data and phones are on the same subnet, you can run into QoS issues if you just start throwing on SSL inspection. \n Anyways, my point is this type of design should not be considered \"over-engineered\" for even a small to medium sized business. MAYBE a mom/pop shop with 10 employees, a DC, a file server, and a couple printers its overkill.

          "description": "Hi, sooo, yesterday I got burned really really badly on a Palo Alto pair that I'm migrating traffic across to. Long story short, it was a mistake my end, I had a NAT rule where I wanted it to NAT to the interface address of the outside interface and I had it built like this....\n Original Packet: Src Zone: Inside Dst Zone: Outside Dst Int: e1/1 Scr Address: entire 10/8 range Dst address: any\n Translated Packet: Src Translation: dynamic-ip-and-port Address-object for outside interface IP Dst address Translation: any\n The problem was, the address-object on the translated packet was what is on the outside interface, including the subnet mask of a /28!! Which royally messed everything up! I'm guessing that it was proxy-arping out for all the addresses in that range/subnet and it ended up killing our current live outbound firewalls!\n What I SHOULD have done is have another address-object that was the same address but on a /32, is that right? That's what I have now, but holy fuck am I scared to switch it back on! Even when going through a change!\n I noticed you can set it to translate to the interface address, interface and IP Address as well? Would this do the same as above when I mentioned about what I should've done instead?\n The PA NAT is definitely a different concept when coming from an ASA and Firepower world! And I lost a lot of confidence and have been pretty hard on myself ever since that happened yesterday and not seeing that!\n Would I be alright doing either of the 2 revised ways mentioned?\n The reason why I switched this particular NAT rule on was that its meant to be a catch all for PAT to the interface address, we have a large routed range that is natted to specific public IP's and they're currently live on the ASA's, so I can't enable those specific ones on the PA's yet, so I needed a way to get the outside interface working to test a few VM's in one of the lower end environments\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m trying to size servers to host a network monitoring solution and I need to « guestimate » how many sessions per second (on average) you can see going through a 10GBit/s (RX/TX = both direction between two IP addresses, whatever the protocols over that) in an ISP network, a small Data Center network and the network of a Large Enterprise. I know it heavily depends on how many equipments are behind those, but… 🤷🏻‍♂️ - I’m starving for real life data ;-)\n And I know every network is different, but that would help me a lot if you could quote average and peak usages for those kind of networks you might have seen on 10G or even a 25G or 40G network (both North-South and East-West). \n I looked at research papers, but… I just couldn’t find anything useful.

I have been a staunch supporter of Arista in the datacenter but the 720 series just don't seem to make sense from a price to performance perspective (7 - 10k for a 24port POE switch...) . I really like Juniper's EX switches and the mist APs have been solid when I have deployed them in the past. However I am already deploying Fortinet / FortiAPs at other locations. I ideally wanted to avoid Cisco and have no experience with Aruba. I was thinking a mix of FortiGate FW \\ AP's and Juniper Switches (POE and Access) would probably work but would be curious to hear what other folks would opt for and why. Lets say for this exercise the site is 25k sqft over 4 floors with a comms room on each with structured caballing between comms rooms and to the floor ports. Cable runs for the AP's are already done. The Site will host about 100 - 150 users at peak. All you have to do is choose the hardware configure \\ install and manage it. Oh I suppose for external connectivity you could have dual DIA at the site with SD-WAN or P2P circuits to local DC locations if that makes any difference. \n ​\n  \nSwitches - Juniper EX (POE)\n Firewall - FortiGate 100 or 200f HA\n \nWireless (APs and Controller if required) - FAP-231G (FortiGate as the controller)\n  \n   submitted by    /u/apresskidougal  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n In our project we use PLC to control field devices with remote IO modules. This communication between PLC and remote IOs is handled by the PLC proprietary Ethernet protocol for SIL4 (safety integrity level).\n For troubleshooting reasons, we need to analyze the packets flowing between PLC and remote IOs so we set the port mirroring option in communication module of PLC. We can see other protocol packets with their respective IO IPs (i.e NTP) or ping packets. However, we can not capture the application data packets (UDP) with Wireshark. We tried port mirroring from both COM module and managed switch (to eliminate COM module mirroring feature bug) but no chance. Neither setup could capture data packets. Managed switch we used is Ruggedcom.\n Is there any restriction/limitation in port mirroring to not mirror the proprietary protocols or something? Are there anyone used this feature in industrial Ethernet environment?\n    submitted by    /u/AdventurousComputer0  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I could do that, it would not matter which network I built between them, it should work. I don't need internet access from the VMs, I just want them to talk to each other. \n Now, this is not that big of an issue on the FMC, as there only seems to be one interface connected, and I have put it on the same network as the FTDv. \n But I think the core issue is.. From the look of the interfaces, both devices are using loopbacks as the interface connected to switch in EVE-NG. I don't want to change the IPs on those interfaces, for fear that I lose the ability to console into the devices, which is currently working through the EVE-NG web console.\n ​\n On both FMCv and FTDv, both eth0 interfaces are configured for the desired management network.

          "description": "Over the last few months, I researched cloud WAN architectures (think of Azure OneWAN, so private infra between sites, i.e., PoPs or datacenters). The more I research them, the more I am convinced that they are really just like big (e.g., Tier 1 AS) internet service provider (ISP) networks. Cloud service providers (CSPs) face the same challenges and appear to use fundamentally similar technologies, except that they might be more \"agile\" in adopting new tech such as the latest flavor of SDN. Both do traffic estimation, traffic engineering, many CSPs also use MPLS tunnels like many ISPs, etc.\n Thus, my question: What are differentiating factors between a CSP WAN (think Azure's OneWAN) and a large ISP network?\n    submitted by    /u/iMrFelix  \n [link]   [comments]",

(I guess the same sort of question applies to the NAT and security policy rules to, that's how I've currently set it all up)\n Thanks all\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently, it's possible to create a bond with only a single network defined, and CentOS allows this. I can see how this might be useful during a configuration process, e.g. as a means of keeping bond settings around to copy from while configuring another, etc., but that's just UI sugar.\n Is there any use case for keeping it this way? We're trying to figure out if we want our GUI to even allow it.

Ours (Fortinet) is coming to end of support.\n We own a small commercial building with a little more than 48 ports in the building. 15 or so go to our own company, and the rest of the building is for executive suites that we rent out to tenants. One tenant may be solo, and another may be 3-4 employees. So whatever product we use needs to be able to isolate the tenants to their own secure network. Beyond this, fairly intuitive interface, good security, and any other bells and whistles that may be beneficial to an executive suites building would be great.\n All that said, they are suggesting Sonicwall. I get the sense that this is just who they've been using for a long time. They speak highly of the product they put out... but I did a little reading on a few posts and found they don't have the best reputation compared to others. Maybe in those instances it was for larger clients with different needs... I don't know these devices are a little outside my expertise :)\n Our building is pretty high end and I'd like our networking capabilities we offer to tenants to reflect that as well.

I've always had a passion for computers, networks, and programming, and shortly after, I started working with DevOps. Since last year, I have been working as an AppSec Engineer.\n Although I enjoy the technical aspect, I see it more as a hobby. Honestly, I have never felt completely satisfied working in this area, and I have always aspired to move into a management or consulting role once I gained more experience.\n I enjoy working with people and I am quite sociable. I hold certifications such as CCNA, Security+, and CySA+. So my question is: am I still too inexperienced to transition into pre-sales?\n I often read that this role requires a lot of technical knowledge, but when would be the ideal time to make the change?\n TL;DR: I have 3 years of experience in tech (1 year as a developer intern and 1 year in cybersecurity). I am not satisfied with the technical work and want to transition into pre-sales. Do I still lack enough experience, or is it possible?\n    submitted by    /u/fcsar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not a data center guy, I'm a transport/radio guy.\n My task is to properly connect the MPLS environment to the two Datacenters. (Currently only commented via legacy DC equipment at one Datacenter only) this task wasnt completed by our senior in 3 years they had to do it and now that person is gone so I'm up.\n My thought is to connect to each DC via EBGP where my MPLS nodes are AS1 and the DC environments are AS2-5 (vPC pairs with separate AS numbers. Idk If that's good design, I didn't set it up and I don't know DC/ACI. I'd almost think each vPC pair would share an AS but have separate AS per DC.)\n Regardless, I'd set route policies to only allow DC to DC traffic to traverse the DCI and any user traffic. From DCA site to DC2 site would traverse the MPLS backbone.\n What general approach would you all take to this?

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n We have been dealing with some issues regarding throughput on our 6e APs, leveraging the 6GHz spectrum. We are using a mix of Aruba 635 (2x2) and 655 (4x4) APs. Each AP offers 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz. We are also using the Cloud controller (Aruba Central, on v8.10.0.6_86193, tested with latest 8.10.x as well).\n We've configured a test SSID as we have begun deploying more 6e devices. We're seeing roughly half the throughput on the 6GHz as we see on the 5GHz radio with the same clients, running speed tests and iperf to local destinations (as well as Internet Speed Test reflecting the same). We see this throughput loss across 40MHz, 80MHz and 160MHz wide channels (it scales up as you'd expect with the increased widths, but we still see ~50% loss of throughput compared to 5GHz). …",

          "description": "I have an old slingbox that tries to reach out to the internet for connection to download configuration data several times a minute. This configuration data will brick the slingbox so it is not wanted. \n I see two solutions. One is to have a packet drop rule at the firewall to drop all these packets from the slingbox. I’ve tried this and it works but I hate the excessive logging. \n The second solution is to set a dummy gateway in the slingbox gateway field. Unfortunately the device would not let me set 127.0.0.1 and I had to pick a unused ip on the lan. This works great. Nothing is logged on the firewall and I can access the device from the lan as I don’t need internet access to it. \n So my question is from a network perspective. I’m assuming the dummy gateway on the slingbox to an ip not used on the lan will create additional arp request looking for it every time the slingbox tries to connect to internet for its bad config data via that dummy gateway.\n What would have the least network impact. The dummy gateway method or using the real firewall gateway and dropping all packets to internet?\n I’m assuming the dummy gateway method would free up any logging and load on the firewall but at the expense of broadcast additional arp request looking for the unused gateway ip. \n So what’s the better solution?\n    submitted by    /u/Proudx2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone. I've run into an interesting/potentially alarming discovery at the office and I wanted some opinions. I'm primarily a SysAdmin but I do have my CCNA so I'm not entirely useless with networking. Our previous NetAdmin left ~2 years ago and we've (I've) been slowly uncovering everything that's been done here as necessary. To say it's over-complicated is an understatement (~100 subnets for a company of then 40 people, not including the /30s for OSPF PTP).\n Background: Our ISP provides us a /30 as well as a /27 that we specifically requested. The /30 subnet is terminated (is that the proper term?) on the ISP's hardware: they provided us x.x.x.124/30, the gateway is x.x.x.125 on the ISP hardware and our IP is x.x.x.126. The /27 is terminated in our hardware connected to their hardware: with block y.y.y.160/27 our hardware has y.y.y.161 and acts as the gateway. x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 are on separate VLANs routable via a VRF.\n The question: is there any benefit to using VRF in this situation? Or is there any benefit to the subnet being terminated by our hardware rather than the ISP's hardware?\n Side note/question: These IPs and the VRF are configured on a switch, not a router and/or firewall. I've further discovered that both x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 provide console access to the switch PUBLICLY. I've since closed that via access lists, but are there any other security concerns regarding this situation?\n Flaired this as routing but it could qualify as security.

So I guess this post is for one of two things.... has anyone done anything similar to deal with one-off bugs that would be hard to identify in a lab environment before changes, and 2.... is there a solid Cisco API that I could parse against a keyword or software function (eg: BGP, SNMP, etc) and a list of device types/versions to try and proactively identify these types of issues? I'll be using Python, but language/nuances don't matter too much as I know not everyone here is super familiar with code.... more looking for if anyone knows manual methods or data sources/api's they've leveraged in the past that I can put code to in order to make a web front end that does these checks for us prior to changes.\n Thanks for any info!\n    submitted by    /u/syntax24  \n [link]   [comments]",

These were simple VPNs which allowed remote users to access their documents at their office.\n The method back then was to set up a vpn connector on the laptop, point it to the public IP, and set up forwarding for a couple of ports in the router. Then IIRC I'd set up permissions in their account on the server.\n I've been called upon to set up a VPN for someone, and it looks like things have changed remarkably. Whn I search in order to bone up, most returns are for commercial VPN companies who are focused on providing anonymity on the web.\n Has my method of creating simple VPNs become completely outdated? I assume that security issues and methods are very different nowadays.\n Are there any good resources out there to re-learn basic VPN principles and best practices? Perhaps as I've gotten older my search capabilities have dwindled, or else I'm so hopelessly out of the loop that I don't even know what to search for within the context of small office VPNs.

I was fairly confident in my skills, being a mix of a sys admin/network admin. \n I understood what I was reading, how to implement changes, why are some areas are wrong, and so forth. I felt I was mid to senior level based on situations I resolved and people around me congratulating me.\n Then I start doing interviews and I couldn't really answer most if not all network questions. It was a eye opener and I believe it was because everything I learned was self taught, (googling, help command, reading past sailors notes, and good old trial and error). \n My current gig title is a system/Network admin where I do software installs for ships and make sure no problems arise during the process. Not a lot of network problems pop up. I want to be a cloud network engineer in the next 5 years, so what is the best way to validate/better my skills as a network engineer in you guy's opinions?\n    submitted by    /u/Glittering_Refuse748  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know this is an 'older' switch to put it lightly, but we are running into some issues with some of our networks losing connectivity randomly. We have a palo alto router and the switch is acting as a l2 switch for several ESXi hosts, passing all traffic to the PA. Earlier we had some problems with certain networks in esxi not being able to reach the gateway and rebooting the switch resolved the issue, leading me to think it was an issue with an incomplete arp table. \n The issues from earlier have now reoccurred with networks that were not experiencing the problems earlier. Has anyone seen this before in this or other l2 switches?\n    submitted by    /u/lilhotdog  \n [link]   [comments]",
