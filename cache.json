Data recovery is in the process but it will take weeks at best and I am not getting any high confidence from the data recovery team. I have an online backup of user data but no viable backup of the actual DC or any other servers that I can restore. I say that, but there is a remote possibility that I can restore my DC from 6 months ago when we upgraded from 2008 to 2022 and swapped roles, etc., however, that is looking like a pipe dream as well (this would be the 2008 server).\n It is a Hybrid Office 365 environment with on-prem DCs and Azure AD (free) for authentication and all. I am assuming that if I were to create everything from scratch (new Forest and DC) there is a high likelihood of all mailboxes getting affected as well because the on-prem SIDs and GUIDs and Object IDs would be different from what they were previously. Waiting for weeks isn't happening but I need at least some domain functions back to survive the carnage.\n I am looking for some bright ideas to get out of this mess!!!!\n My terrible options at the moment are:\n  \nCreate everything from scratch and deal with hybrid issues later\n Hope and try to restore the DC from 6 months ago and minimize the impact to only new users from that point on.\n Can Azure AD be the savior here? - Can the information in the cloud be used to spin up a DC in the cloud? - If that is possible, does this mean I am not fully cloud-based domain environment, or can I then also have an on-prem spun up later?\n  \nI am sure there are some bright minds out there to help navigate this mess.\n Thank you!!!!\n    submitted by    /u/SomePen7659  \n [link]   [comments]",

Over the following months this shifted to, \"we have to post the position and you'll need to apply, but you're our candidate of choice.\" Interviews were earlier this month and I didn't make it past the first round of interviews. My director pulled me aside afterwards to say that I interviewed well, but he had decided to look for someone with more experience. It sucks but business can be that way, I'll just keep my resume updated.\n ​\n Later, it was dropped that the new manager won't be meeting with our team at any point during the interview process. This manager will also report to two directors; during my interview it became clear they had directly opposing ideas of what the new manager should achieve, (director 1 said it would be the new manger's job to take on work from their team and say no to new work from director 2, director 2 said exactly the opposite), and it very much gave me \"divorced parents arguing through the kids\" vibes.\n ​\n After thinking about this for a bit, I never would entertain an offer like this if it had come from another organization. If I was applying for a manager role and couldn't meet the team at least once and was expected to report to multiple directors with directly opposing expectations, I never would consider the role!\n ​\n While it sucks that I was strung along for so long, I'm grateful that it helped me see that this probably wasn't a position I would be happy with, and that a healthy organization probably wouldn't make these kinds of decisions.\n    submitted by    /u/garthand_ur  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just noticed that the FSMO role holder is also a GC. Now in the past i've never paid any mind to this, and the domain seems fine... for years even. But Looking at the microsoft instructions for moving FSMO roles, they clearly state: \"Do not put the infrastructure Master FSMO role on a GC\".\n Why? My domain seems to be running fine. Whats the difference between a DC that is not a Global Catalog, and one that isnt? Can it still be used the same way?\n I only have one DC at this particular site, if i switch off GC, will everything still function correctly?(Auth, Kerberos, etc).\n ​\n My other Domain controllers are also Global catalogs.\n for reference:\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/transfer-or-seize-fsmo-roles-in-ad-ds#identify-a-new-role-holder\n    submitted by    /u/Fizgriz  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's not fancy - we have a Netgear M4250 managed switch driving the network, and then a bunch of CAT6 run through the walls to our endpoints. I'm trying to add wireless for easier troubleshooting and access to the GUIs for my devices. I thought this would be easy (lol). That's the context, now here's the problem:\n I have installed the Ubiquiti Unifi Network application on my Windows 10 laptop, plugged both the laptop and the U6-LR into the switch (PoE+ capable), and am trying to \"adopt\" it to my Unifi network on the Windows app. That's what the documentation covers. However, the adoption always fails, then asks me to \"enter the device credentials that were set on the previously installed location under network device ssh authentication.\" Except that I didn't set any of that - this thing is brand new out of the box. I press the \"forget\" button, which says \"the device will be restored to facotry settings\". That sounds like exactly what I need, but in practice it just starts this loop over again. Same if I hit the hardware reset button. Adoption failed.\n I'm stumped. Does anybody have any idea what I'm doing wrong?\n    submitted by    /u/Squirrelous  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was stagnant in my previous line of work and wanted to try something new (I’m in my mid 30s). In a few years, I’ve learned a LOT, obtained the triad of CompTIA certs, VMware cert, CCNA, and some Azure certs. I assist in managing our VIP clients, and have been promoted 4 times to get near the top of the food chain on the help desk (about 50 of us).\n I love the type of work I do and it just clicks for me, but a huge downside for me is OT. I understand there is OT for every position out there. That’s part and parcel of work. But the daily 1-3 hours (and weekends) of maintenance and troubleshooting the inevitable issues that arise from that work each night is just something I will not continue to do. Give me 40-42 hours a week. Take your money. I want the time off, away from the office. I’m not going to spend 12 hours a day working when I have a wife and 2 kids at home. It’s just too much, I’m burnt out quickly, and I can’t give my family my full, undivided attention they deserve on a daily basis.\n Are there any options out there for me that I can work my way to that is a more traditional “9-5” job in the IT world? When I’m done for the day, I want to leave my work at work. Obviously a sysadmin role at a company is out of the question. Am I more suited for a solutions role or pre sales? Sales? Account management? I’ve only been in the industry for 5 years so I’m fairly new to what options may even be available for me, if any. So I’m at the point where I need to decide if another career move may be needed. \n Any advice at all would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/LikeAGlove91  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ties to their personal accounts. \n I spent the day preparing a full java minecraft package, to deploy at 11:59pm tonight to all systems, and have a custom message that will be pushed at 10am directing users play some minecraft and join xyz server. \n Once they join everyone will start at a specified point with some messages to read regarding the \"game\". They'll have the entier day to build the most elaborate home + an attempt to reach \"the end\". Most likely nobody will get there as its hardcore. Also, if you die you're dead. They've all been provided a named box with the same supplies to help them get started, food and a map.\n Its not much but I'm really happy I was able to get this approved and am able to give the company a few hours of fun before the holidays.\n Any ideas on change to the theme of the game for more fun?

We have to do after-hours support every three weeks for a full week. They are not going to pay us though. We have to volunteer. Now, in IT we've all canceled family vacations and lost money on plane tickets, yada yada.. It's not just happening to me personally, it's my team. My direct manager is great, and so is my IT director. They are very good human beings. I can't stress that enough. Mr. Rogers's territory nice. \"Good people\" if you're from the American Midwest. You know what that term means.\n I got a Teams call today from HR. I had used the F word in an email to my wife on 19 Dec 2023 at 0759 EST. I have a company phone and I had used a company phone to say the F-word in an email. OK fine. I violated company policy. I will endeavor to be mindful in the future when using my mobile phone, not to say the F-word or any other word that people find offensive. That list gets updated yearly. \n I said to the HR rep \" you called to chew me out about email usage, but a multi-billion dollar company is refusing to pay the IT department overtime when we actually work overtime? Can you see why I might be upset? You are not solving problems, you're just making problems up. You never just say thank you to us\". The HR rep said, \"Well, I guess you're thanked with a paycheck\". \n For the first time in 16.5 years, I started updating my resume. I can't continue to \"volunteer\".\n    submitted by    /u/fudog1138  \n [link]   [comments]",

But no.\n A worker for a state agency seeking child support from someone who MIGHT work/have worked for us was reaching out. Legitimate email. Now, did they send this to HR? Some high profile person in the company? No. Somehow they managed to figure out three of our internal distribution lists (likely more, but only those three accept email from outside the domain) and sent a blast out to all of them.\n This is already in \"Oh hell no\" territory. But it was worse. There was an attachment as well as the person's name. And the attachment, an OFFICIAL DOCUMENT, had the Name, Address, Family Members, and SSN of said person they were looking for. Sent to a distribution list with hundreds of recipients.\n HR notified, and well... I'd been putting off on learning how to mass delete things via Exchange powershell. Email is gone except for what's been saved as evidence, but that information was still accessible for several hours. To hundreds of people.\n In HR's hands now, and I really hope that state worker gets more than a slap on the wrist.\n Bless all of you who put tutorials online.\n    submitted by    /u/Draptor  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe somebody over here can help me out on this.\n Let's say my domain is domain.local and my domain controllers are DC-OLD and DC-NEW. I have promoted DC-NEW to be a Domain Controller and Demoted DC-OLD. When I look in my DNS I find:\n 1) zone _msdcs.domain.local, this zone contains all records I expect, SRV records / _gc records / _ldap records etc.\n 2) zone domain.local, this zone contains all servers / computers / etc.\n 3) subzone, _msdcs under number 2. This is a DNS Delegate if I am right (grey icon). In this subzone I only find a NS record pointing to DC-OLD\n The NS record under 3 is not updated by the DC promotion and demotion (number 1 is updated correctly). Feels like it is not actively used in my situation, if I do a lookup to _msdcs.domain.local it will answer with information found in number 1. I think this is some sort of pointer solution used in ealier versions of Windows AD.\n What is the right thing to do? I can think of 2 scenario's:\n a) Replace the NS record of DC-OLD with DC-NEW\n b) Do not give it any attention, let it just like this\n I think scenario a is the best option.

Whilst setting it up, everything worked well and Duo sent a push notification to approve the login.\n Now the user has it, the laptop is obviously not configured for their home wifi, so Duo complains that it can't do anything as it has no network connection. Putting the user in bypass mode makes no difference, as the client still can't connect to the Duo servers...\n Apple in their infinite wisdom doesn't allow you to connect to a wifi network from the login screen. Using the Option key to boot up and connect to a wifi network doesn't pass the connection through to the login screen either.\n I have sent the user a USB-C to LAN adapter which said it was plug and play on Macs, and although it works on their personal Dell laptop, it doesn't work on their company issued Mac. I don't know if this is because it doesn't work on M2 devices, or if the Mac needs to silently install something when it's connected, but because the laptop isn't logged in, it's not able to.\n I've ordered another adapter for the user which claims compatibility with M2 Macs, so I'm crossing fingers for that.\n The user is 2 1/2 hours drive away, so a visit is not really practical.\n Does anyone have any ideas on how I can best get this user up and running?\n    submitted by    /u/BigBursar  \n [link]   [comments]",

Especially if they are auto-forwards from another domain.\n Ideally, we want nothing to go into the junk folder (unless on the block senders list). So everything goes to the inbox, notwithstanding malware and phishing. With everything going to Inbox, it would also be nice to get some indicator of junkiness as a MailTip on the message, but we'd settle for pre-pending the subject.\n Have a ticket open with Microsoft, and here's what we tried:\n  \nChange the anti-spam policy. Any actions that say 'send to junk folder' have been changed to prepend the subject with 'Possible spam'.\n  \nThis doesn't really work. Yes, the subject is changed. But the email still ends up in the Junk folder. Maybe Outlook is doing this by examining the SCL. But there's also no way to turn off the junk filter in Outlook. Just in case, I checked the blocked domains/emails list, and it is empty.\n  \nSet up a transport rule to change all inbound mail to SCL -1. \n  \nThis works, but I don't like it because a) it doesn't prepend the subject, and b) it alters the SCL artificially, so by the time you get the message, you don't know what the original SCL was.\n  \nAdjust the rule to prepend a subject. Ended up pre-pending everything. So we adjusted the rule to only apply to inbound mail where the SCL was above 4. But then the rule seemed never to get applied.\n  \nAdvice?

          "description": "Hello, I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experience here before I jump down this rabbit hole.\n I'm in a ~80 user environment that has on-prem AD (probably not going away) that's using ADConnect to sync users to the cloud and O365/Exchange Online (for many years). Exchange has never been installed in this environment, so there are no Exchange attributes in AD.\n I have a few items I'd like to tackle (mostly cleaning up the GAL (hiding on prem DLs, hiding certain users), ability to add additional addresses to users) that seem they would be easier if I had the Exchange Attributes in AD. My understanding is I can just run \n XX:\\Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms /PrepareSchema \n and that will give me the attributes I need, not install Exchange and I can do basic management from ADSI. I know I'll need to refresh the schema in ADConnect, and I know that for \"msExchHideFromAddressLists\" to populate, \"mailNickname\" needs to be populated an unique.\n Here are a few questions I've come up with\n  \nWill this overwrite anything in the cloud and 'break' existing mailboxes (stuff like legacyExchangeDN or X500 addresses)\n Should I continue with the installation of Exchange server for management purposes? If I go this route, do I need to set up Hybrid Mode? Or is 'just installing' Exchange enough?\n Am I muddling my environment by adding Exchange? Should I instead take alternate routes to accomplish these goals? (like use msDS-CloudExtensionAttribute custom sync rules) For what it's worth, if I installed Exchange, my plan would be to have it on a server that's only booted when doing management tasks, but otherwise not powered on.\n  \nI'm wondering if anyone else has gone down this path before, and curious what you've seen... most of my worry is in overwriting something that was custom set on the cloud for a sync'd user, though I know most parameters must be sync'd from on-prem.\n    submitted by    /u/_TheKnightMan_  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I explain I've done that they ask another dumb question like \"are the mailboxes not being created?\" And then don't respond again.

Android is even worse where it seems to just display Android\n Have others had to achieve the above and if so how are they tackling this? Is the only way by enrollment?

          "description": "From Ars\n  \nResearchers recently discovered a Windows code-execution vulnerability that has the potential to rival EternalBlue, the name of a different Windows security flaw used to detonate WannaCry, the ransomware that shut down computer networks across the world in 2017.\n Like EternalBlue, CVE-2022-37958, as the latest vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers to execute malicious code with no authentication required. Also, like EternalBlue, it’s wormable, meaning that a single exploit can trigger a chain reaction of self-replicating follow-on exploits on other vulnerable systems. The wormability of EternalBlue allowed WannaCry and several other attacks to spread across the world in a matter of minutes with no user interaction required.\n But unlike EternalBlue, which could be exploited when using only the SMB, or server message block, a protocol for file and printer sharing and similar network activities, this latest vulnerability is present in a much broader range of network protocols, giving attackers more flexibility than they had when exploiting the older vulnerability.\n  \nGood news:\n  \nOne potentially mitigating factor is that a patch for CVE-2022-37958 has been available for three months. EternalBlue, by contrast, was initially exploited by the NSA as a zero-day.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/jacobjkeyes  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all,\n Context:\n I hack companies legally through called bug bounties. A few months ago, a Fortune 500 company gave me the opportunity to run phishing campaigns on their employees at a bug bounty event. \n For some reason, they believed they were \"unphishable\" and offered a bounty for each employee I was able to phish. They were using Okta & Duo for MFA. \n So, I bought a domain similar to theirs. I used Gophish & Mailgun to send an email, and Evilnginx to bypass MFA. I abused an XSS in one of their subdomains to redirect to a phishing page. Got 50+ pairs of credentials & Okta sessions, and full access to their AWS console within 2 minutes. I was blown away and terrified by how simple it was to compromise them. \n Questions:\n I'm looking at how people are defending against phishing.\n From what I hear, Proofpoint and Mimecast don't stop most phishing emails. Security education can only be done so often and techniques are evolving.\n Vendor email compromise makes it even more difficult to prevent. \n I know many people also run phishing simulations, but a recent study found \"that embedded training during simulated phishing exercises, as commonly deployed in the industry today, does not make employees more resilient to phishing, but instead, it can have unexpected side effects that can make employees even more susceptible to phishing\"\n You obviously can't expect everyone to be a tech expert and you can't expect email gateways to catch all phishing emails. If phishing simulations can have unexpected side effects, then what? Is trying to prevent phishing a hopeless pursuit?\n So, I'm curious:\n  \nHow are you currently tackling phishing (including vendor email compromise)? \n What providers do you use? (abnormalsecurity.com, inky.com, breachless.ai)?\n \n How often are you requiring security awareness training? With who & why them?\n How do you detect compromise? What do you do next?\n  \nThanks\n    submitted by    /u/sxcurity  \n [link]   [comments]",

If i receive a phone call from an unsaved number i ignore it and do a quick look-up to see if its some person from work, if it's not i answer i.e if they call back again or i will call the person\n next year im just gonna be ruthless and more strict with this thing. When i joined the org 3 years ago i thought some of the seniors are just grumpy fellows who dont like to instantly and joyfully help some users (not that they are always like that) but there would be instances where i thought a user was given a cold shoulder -but now i seem to start getting it\n    submitted by    /u/StrikingPeace  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've yet to come across a satisfying way of dealing with the inevitable issue of multiple people with the same name.

          "description": "I've stepped into a new role and have found a bit of a mess left behind by a previous administrator. \n There is a group policy in place for our O365 that prevents older word files (I.E Word 95) from being opened. From what I understand, this Group Policy was implemented aprox 3 years ago. This is a very sensible Group Policy and I don't want to change it. \n However, I've also discovered that there appears to be a raft of Word 95 documents still within the business. IT never converted the pre-existing Word 95 documents on our 8-or-so file servers. \n It appears the plan to deal with this was to be 100% reactive. If a user cannot open a document, they raise a ticket and the HelpDesk would manually convert the file. I believe the idea was that the Word 95 files used within the business would eventually get converted this way and this will become a non-problem. But 3-years on, this still seems to drive calls to the HelpDesk.\n I'd rather pro-actively convert all our existing Word 95 files and call it a day. My problem is it's probably been a decade since I've needed to do a mass conversion of Word documents like this. And so far my Google-Fu has been failing me.\n Does anyone here have recent experience with a utility that'll scan a file server and convert old Word documents en-mass?\n    submitted by    /u/peldor  \n [link]   [comments]",

The majority of the company's key data is stored on a 1 TB prod Azure sql database (with matching dev and QA, and another smalled 300 GB SQL Server on-prem DB. A few analysts do power BI reporting off these data sources, and one of them connects to a pricing app our sales team uses. We are a microsoft shop basically.\n We are trying to implement true data management program, knowing that we have these needs but also wanting to cover some that we aren't even aware we need. We do know we want:\n - Data dictionary/catalog so analysts know what are the main tables that have the data they want power BI reports and our own compliance\n - Some way to assign data stewards who can keep the data catalog up to date\n - Ways to tag data as PHI, or what it's retention time is, to encourage privacy and retention compliance\n - Seeing lineage of our pipelines\n - Features that help consolidate records and the 'golden record' pursuit\n - In general anything helping us get to the goal of practicing data management.\n The obvious answer is Microsoft Purview, and it seems to click a lot of boxes and we are a microsoft shop, but I'm worried about the pricing. It seems like it could get expensive really quickly with the pay for use model, beyond any value it brings. We have a reasonable budget for data management but it's going to be hard to justify huge bills for what to most people will just be a data catalog.\n Other's I've looked at are data.world, altan, collibri, and alation. Then I see these open source versions with apache atlas or linkedin datahub and wonder if I should be going the free route and spin something entirely myself? I'm not trying to turn this into a sales post because I am skeptical of all of them despite knowing we need something :)\n Has anyone solved similar data management wants with any of these tools?

We have a setup where has a pretty recent workstation with an AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM and an AMD Radeon Pro W5500 on Windows 11. The GPU as far as I can tell is the issue here, which is basically a cut down AMD RX 5700. When using the system normally, everything is fine, but when using it as an RDP host, connecting to it via a system with a Quadro K620 and a 4K monitor, it becomes a laggy mess.\n ​\n In group policy I have enabled the following:\n ​\n 1 - Prioritize H.264/AVC 444 graphics mode for Remote Desktop Connections\n 2 - Configure H.264/AVC hardware encoding for Remote Desktop Connections\n 3 - Use Hardware Graphics adapters for all remote desktop services sessions\n ​\n I have this setup on another workstation that is currently using an old GTX 1080, and performance is excellent (I get random artifacting every once in a while, but overall it's usable). For testing purposes I installed this card into the test system, and performance improved considerably. When checking stats on hardware utilisation, the Nvidia card shows GPU encode activity, whilst the W5500 (and my RX 5700 from my home PC that I brought in for testing) never show any GPU encode activity.\n What is interesting is that the GPU has no problem encoding when using something like OBS.\n ​\n Any ideas what I can do here to improve RDP performance on a 4K monitor using an AMD GPU? Latest AMD drivers are currently installed. I would rather not have to replace the GPU if I could avoid it, it should have the ability to encode properly.

The problem is, management doesn’t like transferring business data over to these companies. Solutions where the data remains on premise are preferred. I understand! \n Nextcloud is usually considered in these scenarios. I am not an expert. I have used nextcloud for personal use, and still learning it (eg, learning about different installation options). I also read a lot about it online. I personally like the software, but from my experience in the past years, I am a bit worried about updates getting broken between major versions, security vulnerabilities with a complex PHP app, and bugs impacting user experience. The web interface will remain open to LAN. \n Do you have any experience with nextcloud in a small business scenario? How secure, robust and reliable is it, as a working replacement to something like Box.com?\n Anyone deploys nextcloud in production?\n On the other hand, I see governments in Germany and France and various institutions use it. I suppose they audited and vetted the code before adopting it. If it’s good for them, it might be good for small businesses too.\n    submitted by    /u/chaplin2  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have undertaken a project that requires data to be moved from multiple locations (let's say 10 for example) to a Central storage server. The problem is that none of the locations will be online, and cannot be online ever, so data must be moved physically by transporting the disks to the central location and unloading the data to the server.\n The satellite locations will have RAID-1 storage pools of 2 disks. Each location will have 4 pools. So in total we have 40 pools of 80 disks that need to be transported to another location, somehow mounted and have all their data copied over to the storage server.\n This will need to happen every month for a year.\n Have you ever done something like this?

What I mean is that if you log on to the console you’ll need to do a ping -t and let it fault for 10-15 times before it starts responding and then works fine from there on out. I tried the last supported version of tools I could find, 11.3, but this didn’t seem to rectify the issue.\n I’ve also made sure to remove the Nutanix guest tools and everything I could think of that might be interfering.\n I’m not seeing this behavior on why if the 2012R2, 2016, win10, etc….

(When I joined I thought great!) \n The issue I have is I'm currently running 3 projects which require communication accross multiple teams, and sometimes even simple tasks like shared mailbox setup take forever as they come to me first, and instead of just doing it.. I have to send it to the messaging team, then have no visibility of the case, so chasing up what I can't see for a relatively simple case becomes a headache. \n On the other hand one of the other projects involves Setting up bespoke software (provided by the vendor) on a server provided by the production network team (None of whom are based in my country) and I cannot even install the software as their server is on their network, and their vlan that I have no access to, RDP copy paste is disabled etc \n This meant I had to log a case with them to request them to open SMB traffic/share to our network so I can transfer the files. To which they said no. And then messaged my boss asking what was taking so long... \n This isn't really a rant, some of the teams mentioned above are very helpful (rather some if their members are) and I have a good working relationship with them, however the above is a regular occurrence. \n Basically I'm looking for advice on how other people manage this if they are in the same situation, or any tips, cheers in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/afwmftw  \n [link]   [comments]",

I removed the /E and tested again, it looked like it was creating new directories, but when I looked at the destination it wasn't doing that anymore (like it think it should be working)\n I did see a blurb on the new Win11 RC version help page about them changing what happens on a certain system folder with /PURGE, but saw nothing about other changes to it.\n I did NOT go back and test older version, so maybe I only thought it was working and removing files from sub-folders if they weren't on the source. Don't know, and I won't invest any more time in that.\n So now with the added /S, but no /E its removing files/folders in sub-directories like I wanted/expected and not copying stuff.\n The /E option on that /PURGE line really screws the pooch!

While our IT department is a coworker and I + our boss who mainly does infrastructure, we are a company with a single office and about 160 people so until now we got by. Today the CEO dropped the bomb that we will expand from 1 to 3 offices over 12 months with around 40-50 new people for the new offices.\n My coworker and I are in the middle of organising and redesigning many processes and polices, together with a new infrastructure for a new software and implementing an intranet so 2023 was already packed. With the news we have to do the work that we planned on padding out over the year (also to be able to do our day to day tasks) in the next 4 months so we can develop solutions to our new issues with having more than 1 office (most of our infrastructure is in our local server rooms so we have to think if this will suffice).\n I am genuinely scared of the sudden rise in scope (neither our grown infrastructure nor our company policies and culture are, as of today, fit for the new environment), but also excited to not only execute the plan but also co-developing that plan\n    submitted by    /u/Auno94  \n [link]   [comments]",

My goal is to eventually become an SWE, and I've spent the last ~2 years self-teaching via Udemy courses, Harvard CS50, and other similar resources, learning Python, some JS, a very small amount of SQL.\n All of my professional work experience to date is in the automotive/customer service industry. The last several years I've been an automotive Service Advisor at a dealership in a wealthy area. I'm no stranger to difficult/entitled people and how to deal with them. I see this as one of my skill sets that may set me apart from others trying to enter the field. So with this in mind, I've shifted gears over the last several months a bit more toward the SysAdmin side to earn my A+ certification, and just this week I earned my Network+ and CIOS badges.\n My reasons for this are:\n  \nDevelop some more foundational knowledge of how hardware/software/networking work because having a greater understanding of that can obviously be helpful.\n Have something concrete to put on my resume other than \"I've been watching a lot of videos and practicing\".\n As stated above, entering IT on the SysAdmin side may be a clearer path to getting into IT for me, given my background.\n  \nMAIN TLDR QUESTIONS;\n  \nIs it common for people hoping to become developers to enter via help desk or similar role, then transition to SWE? Or is it generally better to pick one patch and go all in?\n Should I go for my Security+ and get the \"trifecta\" before throwing applications out? This leads me to the next bullet point\n I'm supporting a family of 5, and my wife does not currently work because our children are still young and not all in school yet. I need to make $80k+ to be able to afford our monthly expenses. Is it feasible for someone without a degree to enter the field making that kind of money?

As we don't have AAD and introducing MBAM did not seem to be worth the effort for our small scale environment, we decided to create just the policy and then activate encryption manually via script per workstation. It suits our needs as we slowly switching from old computer vendor hodgepodge to standardized modern enterprise Dell workstations. The policy was thoroughly tested and I've determined it works and is safe to use company wide, then GPO was applied \"wide\" on almost all workstation containers. I was 100% sure nothing will happen because everywhere i looked GPO managed bitlocker need a manual trigger of some sorts to encrypt the drive by design. Just one day after policy rollout we noticed some of our new Latitude 3420 we gave to the users earlier in the week have bitlocker encryption active. Good thing recovery keys are present in AD but loosing the control of the process is major concern. It's especially weird as it happen only to the latitude laptops. The optiplexes 3000 are behaving as expected. I've read about Dell OOBE bitlocker encryption but it shouldn't effect us as we reimage all computers straight out of the box using WDS. Investigation of windows events gave me nothing to hold on to. It seems like one time event per host because once decrypted it wont happen again. My hypothesis is that WSD <WillWipeDisk>true< is not clearing bitlocker partition containing some sort of residual Dell ransomware but it does not seem likely. \n What are your thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/Wyczochrany  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have contacted a few users of various technical proficiency to test out the instructions I have written up for them (a lot of older, computer-illiterate folks) and one thing I didn't anticipate (although I should have) is that quite a few folks were hesitant to download the MS Authenticator app, with some even outright refusing. Not everyone has a smart phone issued to them so we are still offering the option to authenticate with SMS. It's not ideal, but better than nothing. \n Other than reiterating that the app does not collect personal information and does not open your personal device up for FOIA requests, is there anything I can tell people to give them peace of mind when we start migrating entire departments to MFA? I have spoken with department heads and our city manager about the potential for unrest over this, but is it just a case of telling people to suck it up and do it or you won't have access to your account?

From looking at the logs, I can see the login attempt from a remote location and a Authenticator MFA notification was approved. The user tells me that they didn't receive or approve any notifications. I tend to believe them since we have the numbers matching and location based settings turned on for Authenticator and I would think they would remember typing in the numbers.\n The strange thing I noticed is that the audit logs show a change in authentication methods at the time of the login. An iPhone was mysteriously added as an authentication method on the account.\n Has anyone seen behavior like this before?\n Update: After reviewing logs it looks like credentials were phished then an MFA approval by the user. I don’t think their lying, they just didn’t even realize they were phished. This created a mess because the attacker sent out 100’s of emails from the account.

Business critical software is managed via Intune, will stay this way.\n PDQ Deploy and alike won't really work due to cloud requirement. I also don't want to rely on Intune for every app, updating it manually. I don't have the manpower at the moment. This is a one man department with MSP support. I need this to be smart and automated, while keeping it inhouse within my control. Something I can setup and let it do the work, like with Lenovo Commercial Vantage for firmware and driver updates on our fleet of devices.\n I'm looking into winget right now, specifically this spin on it: Winget AutoUpdate - WAU and I really like it so far, testing in the lab. Of course I know it won't cover 100% of my inventory, but it works really well for what it is.

This is set up in O365 via connectors and has an appropriate SPF record in our DNS.\n Could this be giving a false positive and passing on DMARC? In the header details, Authentication-Results comes back as a spf=pass, dkim=none, dmarc=pass but this is with the IP of our signature server so that is good because we want that to pass. Whereas Authentication-Results-Original returns a failure: spf=fail, dkim=none, dmarc=fail.\n Has anyone experienced this before and do you have any advice in how to combat this?

For example our Mailchimp account, [support@company.com](mailto:support@company.com) with a randomly-generated password. An employee leaves and we want to make sure they can't get into this account. Simple enough, change the password.\n What do I do when there's Mailchimp, Unifi, Namecheap, VMware, Cisco, 300 of these accounts? Changing all of these passwords individually when an employee moves on is obviously an option but there has to be a smarter way.

Maybe its the few people I have worked with. I've seen people at my last job hire someone with \"years of experience\" just to find out they cant use the home keys. Next thing you know I have to explain a process to them several times. training new people is exhaustive.\n I have been using a mouse / keyboard since I was a kid so I don't expect everyone to be a fast typer but I feel like there is a correlation between keyboard familiarity and knowing your shit.\n Have any of you seen someone break this stigma that I have in my head? are there people out there in senior management positions that actually know what they are talking about and are chicken peckers? or new employees you got in? \n Edit: a lot of people are taking this personally.

          "description": "We (the server/sysadmin team) have been managing SCCM for about 5 years. We use it for reporting, Windows client updates (monthly), some application installs, and other various means. \n Recently, our Systems Architect has decided the help desk needs to manage Windows updates for the clients, his reasoning? They are workstations, the server team is not responsible for them. Ok, from a high level perspective, I agree. However, the system used to manage those updates is our responsibility. \n He is really pushing this on the help desk, so I've decided him and I need to have a meeting about this. \n I find several issues with this line he is trying to draw:\n •The help desk does not currently manage nor know how to use SCCM (I understand this does not mean it isn't their responsibility)\n •The sysadmin team has been managing SCCM for 5 years (this doesn't mean it's our responsibility)\n •None of our roles define SCCM as a responsibility\n Typically, a Desktop Engineer role would buffer this, but we don't have that role.\n So who is responsible? Managing clients is a gray area, some responsibility falls on us, some on the help desk. This all started when I pulled the data on our ~800+ clients running 1909, critically out of date. He said the help desk should have known and been on top of it, and here we are. \n I have found little to no help desk roles in the industry where SCCM is a requirement, quite the opposite for sysadmin roles. \n I look forward to and appreciate all your input.\n Edit: Lots of good points about this being an opportunity for the HD folks to grow. The problem is, they don't want to grow, or learn SCCM, or apply for our open sysadmin role. \n I hope this provides some clarification on that front.\n    submitted by    /u/azguard4  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its just trying now to figure out how to turn this on and then begin full migration over to it from those that are using the less secure methods (SIM Swap/etc). \n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/Elderusr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, I'm not really experienced, when it comes to malware and viruses, so I don't know, where to start, that's why I'm turning to your expertise again. If you need more info, please go ahead and ask, and I'll provide any necessary info.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/xdernomad  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have worked in an array of different industries, most notably finance, manufacturing, and media.\n My previous position had me in DevOps engineering where I was able to master Kubernetes, Helm, CI/CD, and Infrastructure-as-code best practices. Unfortunately due to various reasons I reached that \"burn-out\" point where I was underpaid and overwhelmed with the work being requested of me, so I found a new position earlier this year, working in media.\n A few months in, the transition between the two environments has been, well.. extreme.\n Pros: Finally getting paid what I'm worth, in an industry more to my liking, with less responsibility!\n Cons: Mostly Windows environment (few hundred servers, mostly bare-metal), no documentation aside from a handful of spreadsheets, inconsistent communication within the department, no one's even heard of a code repository before, management is very resistant to change. \n I'm someone who's done all the DevOps things and enjoys doing them when the workloads are reasonable. This is the path I want to grow in as (from what I can tell) the world is moving more towards microservice/IaaS models. \n Am I in the right for wanting to gracefully push the place more towards modern standards? or should I just accept that this is the culture in the new industry and maybe this position isn't a good fit after all?\n    submitted by    /u/roguesaxophonist  \n [link]   [comments]",

TLDR; it's less secure than AES256.\n Step 1) audit your domain controllers for RC4 in use. Just replace DC01 with the name of your domain controller. 0x17 events means RC4 is being used.\n Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Security' -ComputerName 'DC01' -FilterXPath \"*[System[EventID=4769] and EventData[Data[@Name='TicketEncryptionType']='0x17']]\" \n What this uncovered is that Azure AD Connect for hybrid environments was using RC4 (it creates a computer object called AZUREADASSOACC). I guess the reason for this was that until sometime in 2020 AES wasn't supported?? So if you use Azure AD Connect, you might want to look into this to improve security.\n Anyway, this article nicely outlines the steps needed to get Azure AD Connect using AES https://azuregeek.io/en/secure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac/?q=%2Fen%2Fsecure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac%2F\n After following these steps & rolling over my Kerberos decryption keys I now see Azure AD SSO now using AES (0x12 in the event log)\n    submitted by    /u/MediumFIRE  \n [link]   [comments]",

It whitelists all salesforce IPs for example, even if it's a newly set up gmail etc. There are a lot of ways to exploit this list that I've observed since reporting the issue and just two weeks ago we had something very malicious make it through.

We quickly found out that was not what should have been done and they should have had the command, Enable-MailUser run on them as they are external contractors and we simply want to have them as AD Users that have an external email address that mail is resolved to.\n Okay, simple enough I thought. So, I went ahead and ran the following for each user that was affected:\n Disable-RemoteMailbox -Identity <users> -Confirm:$false\n Enable-MailUser -Identity <user> -ExternalEmailAddress <[user@theircompany.com](mailto:user@theircompany.com)>\n We also wanted their Email field in the General tab of AD to match their UPN, so after running the above commands, AND before AAD sync happened (unfortunately) we updated their Email field to match that of their UPN. When we run the Enable-MailUser is makes their Email property their external email address. Well, that appears to have messed up those users where now On-prem they are showing as MailUsers, but in 365 they are showing still as a UserMailbox for RecipientType.\n We are struggling to get this update on both ends. So far, I have tried taking one of the users and running Disable-MailUser, letting that sync over to 365 and then running Enable-MailUser again. No luck. I have tried having the user set up as a MailUser On-prem and then stop syncing them with 365. Once they are no longer synced, I then re-sync them, but again, no luck.\n What's even stranger is we noticed that when we disable them On-prem as a MailUser, and then re-sync them, one property keeps getting written back it would seem from 365 to On-prem...\n Within the user's proxyAddresses, one address shows up. The x500? I'm wondering if I am missing a step here or if something else needs to be updated for these users to finally sync up as a MailUser On-prem as well as in 365?

Now, I don't have anything important on it and really isn't a big deal whatever happens to the system, but I would like to know what even could happen. How does an unpatched system get infected if I'm just on the internet using an updated browser? Everywhere I read that missing security updates is a big no no, but I want to know how. If I used trusted updated software, don't download and run anything shady, how does my system get infected then?

I'm really happy about this, considering that I fell in love with it. Recently, we had some internal \"problems\" with the cybersec team (which is not in the IT dept anymore), and the question of the day is \"who should do what?\" Now that a lot of stuff has been migrated in the Purview portal, I think it's harder to identify who should have access to it and, in particular, define all the permissions. I think both the exchange admin and the security admin should have access to the portal, and it's mandatory that both the part talks before making any changes.

The main repo server will be the only one able to go out to the web, everything else has to point at it for their packages/updates.\n 100% ubuntu environment with server and desktop\n I've played with aptly in the past but the process of having to do the mirrors/snapshots and publishing and everything can be a bit of a hassle to update the repos often. Not major gripe but it's just something.\n Apt-cacher-ng as a proxy seems promising as well. Haven't used it but pretty straight forward.\n Would it be better to just utilize the proxy instead of storing an entire mirror of all ubuntu repos locally? I feel it would be, since that would be a huge waste of space if we only use maybe 20% of the actual packages in the repo. Not going to waste time figuring out exactly what packages each system uses but if we utilize the proxy then it can cache what's needed and other systems can just grab from there if it's cached and cut down on network traffic going out.\n One main concern is being able to freeze the updates/packages so that we can update our test string, verify it works and then update the prod string with the same package versions and everything.\n Obvious workaround is just to take note of package version #s when we do the update to test string but while doable that would be annoying for some of the admins i'm sure and I want this as simple as possible.\n Is there a way to set apt-cacher-ng to have 2 cache directories?\n    submitted by    /u/HauntingDebt6336  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn’t want to hurt the guys feelings so I told him I need to be remote to be able to support my family more which is true but mainly I was sick of the constant lack of support while being handed project after project while trying to be an entire IT department for a large organization. \n I kid you not I got the 5 stages of grief from him.\n In no particular order:\n Denial- what do you mean? Your not putting in your 2 weeks notice are you?\n Anger- There is no way I am going to be able to replace you by the deadline! Who gave you an offer? How much?\n Bargaining- Would you stay if gave you 5 grand? Can you please stay until march, I’ll let you work from home! We can work with you. Please let me work with you!\n Depression- I thought we were friends. I can take care of you. Give me a chance please! \n Acceptance- you’ll want to hand in a formal notice of resignation if this is what you really want. \n I didn’t want to tell him I accept an offer anywhere else but he kept patronizing me by telling me that money is gonna be tight and shit so i finally told him I got an offer somewhere else that gives me more freedom. He kept fucking grilling me to give him a chance to do good by me but it just felt weird. I told him I’d sleep on it cause I felt bad but I told him not to expect me to change my mind. Now he’s fucking texting me outside of work saying he spoke with the ceo so they can “make it work” for me to work remotely most of the time.\n TLDR; Gave 2 weeks notice and tried to be nice by focusing on a personal priority of mine instead of telling my boss what i really think and it back fired. \n I’m handing in a formal resignation tomorrow hopefully it’s all just acceptance from there out.\n    submitted by    /u/red_plate  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Is there even a big software company that provides even middling support these days?\n This weekend was a final migration from on-prem file server to Box. Users had been warned for weeks that this was coming, that the Box app had already been pushed to their computer, and that they needed to sign in to see how it worked so they would understand how everything worked and how to access shared files once the server is down.\n Of course most users ignored this and so, expecting exactly that, I was on site first thing today to get them going.\n Unfortunately things went sideways and most people who hadn't already signed in were unable to. The company uses Google Workspace so Box had been added as a SSO app through SAML, but signing in with their Google credentials either produced a prompt to create a password (???) or an error saying \"invalid credentials\".\n I immediately created a ticket with tons of detail and SAML traces, got a pretty quick reply from a T1 tech who said that the accounts I referenced didn't have passwords and could I please have the users create them. After a bit of back and forth about what \"SSO\" stands for he escalated the ticket.\n Hours passed. Frantic web searches yielded nothing. I looked through the SAML traces myself and couldn't find anything (I know nothing about web dev but figured I'd try). I called the Box account manager, who also \"escalated\". Updated the ticket email with more details. Called the account manager again. Had the customer's CFO call the account manager with me on the line.\n 5 hours later I got a reply from someone claiming to be a T2 tech, asking for a SAML trace from an affected user.\n    submitted by    /u/aeolist  \n [link]   [comments]",

A year or two ago or so, one of the UniFi \"controller\" upgrades put a bunch of our older, perfectly-functioning AP's out of management scope. They still run but we can't change any SSID settings or even see how many clients are connected because the hardware is EOL. I could understand a nag screen or something, but to actually take functionality away from perfectly functional hardware? Come on now.\n So we bite the bullet and pick up some new U6-LR AP's. Oh fantastic, now they are pulling 16+ watts each and overpowering the PoE switches, leading to constant reboots of the APs. Cool - it's one of the bugs that is fixed in the new UniFi \"Network Application\", let's upgrade that again.\n Nope! That requires installing Java 11, which seems to be either unobtainable or undetectable, because I've installed at least 3 different versions of JDK, OpenJDK, some weird third-party extraction of JRE 11, and some other garbage, just for the UniFi installer to tell me it still needs Java 11 and quit the installer. Why does the latest Unifi software not use the latest Java? We're on version 19 now for God's sake.\n So now I can't access old hardware, can't use new hardware, can't upgrade the software, and if I'm able to install it I'm sure I will run into some other new stupidity, plus have to hack my way into making it a service again because it's only a console application for some ridiculous reason.\n /rant\n    submitted by    /u/AmazedSpoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My company is a late adopter of the cloud, though they want to go to the cloud. For On Prem we use mainly Hyper-V for Windows and RHEV for Linux. I am on the Linux side and trying to create a gold image as we don't want to use the Market Place images, due to costs and mnagement. We have about a half dozen subscriptions for Azure and each one has many resource groups. \n ​\n In tests it looks like the market place image is easy to deploy, though it isn't what we want. Looks like custom images are tied directly into the resource group and I think, if I undrestand it correctly, we need to have a gallery to be able to use an image within the other resource groups in the same subscription, though need a seperate gallery for each subscription? It feels like there are a lot of different settings when it comes to creating an image and Azure is very picky, yet very unforgiving about things. Simple things like changing names of the image can't be done, you have to create a new image w/ the name you want.\n ​\n Due to inforced RBAC, we can only create and delete VMs, we can't create Images, which is an internal problem that we have. So it doesn't help that we have a seperate team working on it, though we are trying to have that role added to our group. The other team, which is part of the Windows Team uses Market Place Image for their stuff, so they don't have much experience with creating gold images.\n ​\n Also the latency between the cloud and our on prem enviornment seems to introduce a lot of other issues, we have to up timeouts in tools that we have no issue communicating across the country to our sister DC, though communicating between our DC and Azure in the same side of the country has time out issues.\n    submitted by    /u/DogNamedCharlie  \n [link]   [comments]",

After some misshaps in my personal life, i've had difficulties finding a job as a developper. I then decided to apply for helpdesk positions at multiple local companies and landed myself a job at the local university.The job was advertised as a \"helpdesk\" position.\n I've been working there for the past 1.5 years. The transition with the person before me was a little rocky at first since i had so much to learn in so little time (AD / GPOs / Imaging / Networking ...) and i'm still learning new stuff everyday.\n I manage around 150-200 Windows 10 machines. The department uses a variety of CAD softwares ( CATIA / Inspire / MoldFlow / MSC Patran_Nastran / Vericut ...) but they mostly use SolidWorks.\n The person before used to create a windows image every year with the latest version of the softwares they use. This created a problem where the images he created were at the very least 75gb. I've been able to move away from this by automating most of the installs with scripts.\n Now that i think i have the basics down, i'd like to optimize the process and find ways to deal with SolidWorks configs in a multi-user environment.\n    submitted by    /u/Delicious-Stay-8550  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I work in the IT Department of a company with a couple of hundred remote users, who are a mix of technicians and sales people who use their devices constantly. Occasionally I need to configure a device and have it sent to them, and because they use it all day, they need it to arrive already configured, logged in, applications set up etc etc.\n ​\n We're using InTune with AzureAD authentication, a mixture of Windows laptops/tablets and Android phones. We're encrypting the devices before sending them out etc.\n ​\n The main issue I'm having is that before I can configure a device, I need to contact the user and ask for their password. Sometimes the user is unavailable, and I can't get hold of them, which delays things, and I also worry that taking a note of their password is a bad practice.\n ​\n I wonder if there is a way that I can configure the devices and sign into the user's corporate accounts on the devices without needing their password. If not, then what is the best practice to do this?\n    submitted by    /u/RealChloe  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to open the SSH port on this server so that the ssh connection is allowed only after VPN authentication.\n Which of the following firewall rules is correct:\n  \nspecifying the tunnel:\n ufw allow in on tun0 from any to any port 22 \n \nspecifying the VPN IP address:\n ufw allow from 10.8.0.2 to any port 22 \n \n Let’s say the server is at 10.8.0.1, and there is only one client at 10.8.0.2. \n For the second rule, the interface tun0 is not specified. The IP address 10.8.0.2 is not unique. What if the packet comes from an external private IP 10.8.0.2 to the default interface eth0, not from the 10.8.0.2 in the tunnel ? It seems to me the interface must be specified not the IP, to restrict SSH to VPN.\n For the first rule, I suppose the request from 10.8.0.2 first goes to the VPN gateway, say, 10.8.0.0, and then to 10.8.0.1. So shouldn’t it be “from 10.8.0.0”?\n Another question: For the “to any,” if I specify “to 10.8.0.1,” would that prevent NAT masquerading, thus login rejection?\n    submitted by    /u/chaplin2  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has around 400 users( students, teachers etc) and has around 200 computers but there not managed by a ad server or any server, there are some print server and smb share but it's kinda minimum for that many devices. So I asked if I could set up a ad server for loging in and deploying software. They said there's no money for buying a windows server standard license. My thought to overcome this issue is to install ad server on a Linux server. But with that many users and many features like wsus and many other features not present in Linux ad implementation is it a good idea or should I just leave it alone and make milion local users\n    submitted by    /u/Terrible_Reception79  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was just wondering if anybody had any tips for getting some of my clients' Office 365 software clients synced and running correctly. So far my process has been this:\n - Remote in through Teamviewer\n - Open Outlook\n - Backup .PST files (some of these folks have multiple mailboxes, so I make separate backups for each, which is a total pain and very tedious and time consuming)\n - Delete Profile from Control Panel > Mail Credentials\n - Run Outlook & Put In Email Address & P/W\n - Import .PST Files\n There has to be a better way. Like, I thought I should just be able to tell the email software that Hey! This is now Office 365! And then it just automatically swaps over or something. Is this really the only way to do this? Thank you for any help/tips. It is greatly appreciated as it looks like I'm starring down the barrel of a full week of 10 hour+ days if this is how it has to be.

Also noticed a fan was down in the logs in the idrac. \n Okay, put in a service ticket as it's under warranty. Go home and think nothing of it. \n 2nd shift tech shoots me a message in the middle of the night that he noticed something revving up in our DC but couldn't pinpoint it - then goes home. While everyone is sleeping the idrac shuts the NAS down on it's own overnight. I come in next day, can't remote into it so I find out it is offline, then plug in a crash cart. All the volumes showing as foreign and the config is gone.\n OK - little worried. Check the idrac and see all the volumes disconnected from the raid controller. Bump up the escalation on the service ticket and engineer comes out within a few hours. \n We replace 1x drive, 2x fans. Bright orange dell fans were now black and a little melty. Forced to acknowledge all the volumes as foreign and reload the config. Thankfully everything boots as it should and that knot in my stomach releases a bit.\n Apparently if you lose 2 of 5 fans, the unit shuts itself down to protect from heat damage. The more you knowwww!\n Not sure why the config was wiped other than perhaps the shutdown was not the most graceful.\n    submitted by    /u/E__Rock  \n [link]   [comments]",

My original idea was to just drag all the emails from their Google Workspace into a local pst file on Outlook desktop app then after changing over to M365 to copy them back across. More labour intensive but safer?\n Also if I do the migration for a 15GB mailbox I expect that to take several hours and theres a good chance emails will be received during that time so what happens to them?\n Have I missed anything out?\n One thing that does concern me is that at the top of that page it says \"Effective from December 2022, the classic Exchange Admin Center will be deprecated for worldwide customers. Microsoft recommends using the new Exchange Admin Center, if not already doing so. \"\n The further down in step 5 it says \"IMAP migration is not available for new EAC. \" \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/wagglyears  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was able to install and set up the machine and share the drives that they wanted to be shared but I'm unable to allow users to enter their credentials to connect. Currently the only way it works for me is if it's passwordless, otherwise anytime anyone tries to connect it says that they're not authorized to do so. I figured I could solve this by adding the server 2019 machine to their domain but so far I haven't had any luck. I keep getting an error saying it found the DNS but can't connect. Can anyone help me out please? I'll edit this with the exact errors soon I'm heading in to the office now\n    submitted by    /u/Solid_Sleep1738  \n [link]   [comments]",

A lot of users are using laptops. When they connect their laptop to a cable, their WiFi is still connected. Because of this, a lot of users are using two IP addresses while only one is needed.\n I found some solutions.

However, I don't think this cancels the IP Lease that the WiFi connection has. Is there a way to make the WiFi disable AND the leased WiFi IP to be released again?\n The GPO solution would be the best, as we wouldn't have to do this on every pc individually. I found the following policy: Computer Configuration -> Policies ->Administrative Templates -> Network ->Windows Connection Manager > Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows\". I am not sure if this also releases the IP-lease of the WiFi connection from the DHCP pool.

          "description": "Hi to everyone,\n Next year I will quit my work as system and network administrator and I plan to travel the world for a year. \n Does someone know where to find \"remote/freelance\" job offers or has already experience with this situation. \n I am still undecided how and whether I want to work at all. On one side I would be happy to have an income to cover my expenses a little. On the other side I dont know if it would limit me too much in my plans.\n I cannot be sure to be always available (internet connection in rural areas all over the world?) and the time differences would also cause problem. Of course, I also want to do and see as much as possible during my trip. To work would also mean a daily loss of time. \n It is not about the money. I don't necessarily have to work to be able to afford the trip. However, it would be helpful.\n I could imagine working a few hours a day as 1st Level remote support. But I'm not even sure if I should. \n Do you think it makes sense to look for a job in IT at all, or are other fields of work better suited. For example, as a sales agent. However, I have no experience in this or other sectors. \n Background:\n Working in IT for more then 10 years. More or less fluent in 3 languages. \n 3 years first and second level support with basic tasks. (mostly onsite computer repairs, helping on user requests with office etc, some network and server administration)\n Afterwards in a small industrial company where my colleagues and I have been responsable for \"everything computer related\". From Backup, Network, Mailing, Virtualization, Software, Hardware, Printers, Mobile Devices, Security and so on. \n I would say I have deep knowledge of most areas a normal company uses, so I would not need to much training in something \"easy\". \n ​\n But as I already said I am unsure if this would even fit me. \n Let me hear what you guys think about my thoughts.\n    submitted by    /u/Bottibottas  \n [link]   [comments]",

The salary is good, and you know the usual 9-5 job, I decided to give my notice to my current employer to join this company.\n Mid my notice period, a startup company that is funded and supported has offered me a position, the salary is the same as the one I received from company I'm moving into, although the base salary itself is higher by around $500/month, since they don't have the same benefits as that company, they decided to pump my base salary in order to match the offer that I received from the big company.\n Overall, both companies offered me the same salary, although the big company got more now such as bonuses, among other benefits.\n The startup does not have any benefits beside the monthly salary as they are pretty new right now, I asked them about bonuses, and they said its planned but not yet confirmed as they've just started. They also do not provide equity, and they could not provide me with an answer if they plan on giving equity or not.\n I'm honestly pretty confused right now on what to pick, I was gonna pick the startup as I bet it would be more relaxed (in terms of environment not work), but if i'm taking a high risk, what's the high reward exactly if there is no equity provided ?\n Sorry for my bad English, please let me know your thoughts about this :(\n    submitted by    /u/Live_Ad_74  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone. I was looking for some opinions here. I searched for other posts similar to my situation, but I wanted to get some advice since many posts were a few years old.\n We could have better backup storage at my company. Currently, we have two sets of external drives attached to our backup system onsite, sitting in the same room on top of each other. Each set of drives hosts an independent copy of all of our backups. We are also copying a set of these backups into Azure.\n I was permitted to look into upgrading these off-brand external drive enclosures into a rack-mounted solution for Site A and then putting an offsite backup into Site B. I got a quote for a Synology system, but the fact that they're forcing you to use their branded drives doesn't sit well with us. Additionally, it would be about $10-12k for one of these systems - which was more than they wanted to spend on two systems.\n As I was thinking of alternatives, I remembered we have two SuperMicro servers (that we used to use as Hyper-V servers) that aren't being used, each having 16x drive bays in them. Both have 256GB of RAM and plenty of processing power, even though they're ~8 years old. I was thinking of loading TrueNAS Core onto these servers, loading up the bays with storage, using these as our physical backups at sites A and B, and then still copying a set into Azure. I have never used TrueNAS before, but I think it would accomplish what we need. I can also get some 18TB Iron Wolf Pro drives for $300/ea - so ultimately, the cost of this buildout would be the cost of the drives.\n Would you have any thoughts on this setup? Pros/cons? Alternatives I should look at? Our total footprint is 50TB, but we're currently not doing Client Backups or O365 Backups, so that will be my next project - so I need room to expand.\n I appreciate any opinions.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/MurrghFromIT  \n [link]   [comments]",

This previously worked.\n We did have RM (UK educational network software vendor) remote in and tell us some GPO changes we made were in the wrong place (GPM, rather than RMMC, the RM management software), but i'm unsure if their changes have affected it. (though i'm sure it worked before they remoted in). RM themselves are as stumped as we are.\n Inheritance looks OK, the GPOs have the right settings, but for some reason, it's just not picking up the user GPO. The affected accounts largely seem to be legacy Roaming Profile accounts that have been converted to UEV.\n Anything i could have missed? Could there be legacy cruft affecting it?

We are having plenty of difficulties patching third party applications and don't have the man power to keep packaging apps.\n While we looked and trialed PatchMyPC and worked really well, a subsidiary of ours isn't using MECM and has all their devices enrolled into Intune/Endpoint Manager. This was fine, until we went to enroll the terminal servers, which at that point realised Microsoft doesn't support Endpoint Manager for MS Server.\n So now we are looking at RMM tools to help us with, application deployment and patching. I have come across a number of tools, and NinjaOne seems to be on top. But their pre-sales are frustrating and constantly want me to do a demo session with their techs instead of just giving me a price on the 2500 devices I want to cover.\n I checked out Gartner, but it doesn't do quadrants for this in particular, more so unified desktop management which brings MS Endpoint Manager to the top.\n If anyone could chime in on if you had a blank slate, what would you do? Also the business will not touch SolarWinds with a 10ft pole because of the scandal last year/year before and I have heard mixed reviews on ManageEngine's Desktop Central.\n    submitted by    /u/LLOB_O  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the day to day pc replacement, we just use the dell default image, go through the oobe and install everything by hand in-person, then manage the rest with our RMM. For a re-image, we just use the media creation tool image and once again go through the oobe, join domain, install software. \n For large scale replacements, (When win7 went EOL) we had a process where we would upgrade the PC to win10, and then use Macrium reflect to clone the PC onto a brand new PC. This was relatively quick and effective at the time, however over the last 2 years we have had constant issues with a lot of the cloned machines and ended up re-imaging most one by one. \n I have been asking management to start doing the Dell Image Assist, where we get them from dell mostly pre-imaged, but they decline every time. \n Well, now, one of our larger clients just had 150 new Pc's delivered, that they need installed, and the ticket has been just dropped onto me to get it done.

No issues save one - an old VPN software from the state. No user or IT complaints so far. Some of our data is under federal regulation and cannot be on unpatched or unsupported systems so being on an unsupported OS is not an option. We have other systems and unregulated data on very old software written for Win XP that has no trouble running on Win11.\n To minimize IT support and troubleshooting and dual documentation for end users, I am hoping to make the transition quickly.

Sure we get dickhead users and silly requests like everyone does, but somehow the way the company manages all of this make this a non-issue.\n All that corporate mumbo jumbo about culture, all the Richard Branson quotes, the LinkedIn posts that talk about stuff - this place actually does all of that, for real, and no one waffles on about it. A recruiter emailed me the other day offering an interview for a position with better working times and 25% better pay and I replies saying not interested before I read the full spec. \n I don’t have a motivational quote or a moral lesson to finish off on, just felt like sharing.

One thing they found was a high number of users that had adminCount set to 1. Their recommendation was to clear the adminCount for all standard users and see how many of them return to an adminCount of 1 the next time SDPROP runs and review the list at that time.\n I inadvertently cleared the adminCount for ALL AD objects instead of just the standard user objects. In other words, the builtin groups that are supposed to be protected were also cleared. When I realized this, I set the adminCount for those groups and 2 users (administrator and krbtgt) to adminCount=1.\n Admittedly, my understanding of how SDPROP works could be way off but my expectation would be that when SDPROP runs, any users of those protected groups should have thier adminCount set to 1, inheritance disabled and their ACL replaced with the same permissions as what are on the AdminSDHolder object.\n However nothing is getting the adminCount set back to 1, not even domain admin group members. I don't know how to check to make sure that SDPROP is running or not. I checked the PDC for the registry entry that controls the SDPROP frequency (HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\NTDS\\Parameters\\AdminSDProtectFrequency) and it doesn't exist so it should be running every hour by default. I even tried triggering SDPROP manually.\n Any ideas of what I could check next or what I might be missing?

          "description": "Hello !\n ​\n First of all, sorry if i make gramatical/technical mistakes, English is not my first language.\n So, recently, my company started to use Azure AD for using Office 365 with a federated Domain. We set a SSO with Shibboleth linked to our main domain. Then, if a user try to connect to the domain, it redirect them on the CAS page, and if they're already connected, allow the authentication. This was done with our network engineers, actually in charge of the OpenLDAP (one of the domain is on Samba 4 and the other only have and LDAP and no samba)\n ​\n Since then, we though of some amelioration and I was trying to log in windows with work account (so an account present in the azure A.D). It works for the account in managed domain, but doesn't for the federated domain.\n ​\n I know it's logical since the Windows authentication can't redirect them to our CAS, but I read online that some people can login with federated domain username and password. My question is, how ?\n ​\n I believe the main mistake was during the first implementation of the SSO with the command Set-MsolDomainAuthentication. We used the command as :\n Set-MsolDomainAuthentication -DomainName $OurDomain -federationBrandName $FederationBrandName -LogOffUri $LogoutUrl -Authentication Federated -PassiveLogOnUri $LogonURI -SigningCertificate $certData -IssuerUri $uuri -PreferredAuthenticationProtocol SAMLP \n We didn't use \"ActiveLogonUri\", but I'm not sure if this is usefull, nor really sure about what that property can do. Still, this command work for the web-based applications but obviously not for Windows authentication \n Is this the problem or am I completly out of place ? Do you have any idea about the origin, or a solution ?\n ​\n Regards,\n    submitted by    /u/Keysrin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Yesterday I discovered that 463 of the 1801 Dutch government domains are unnecessarily vulnerable to code injection and XSS attacks due to the use of static `nonces` in the Content-Security-Policy. A `nonce` should not be guessable and should be generated randomly on every request. The official documentation is clear on this: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#security-nonces.\n I have reported to the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), and they confirm the incorrect implementation but do not consider it a security problem. \"We will, therefore, not process your report further,\" said an anonymous employee. In addition, I was still imposed that I may not disclose which domains are involved.\n I stumbled upon this problem by chance and selflessly took the trouble to map out the scope of the problem and report it properly. I am not in this for a bounty or anything; I just wanted to help out.\n It is disappointing to see that the Dutch government cannot implement basic security measures according to specifications to protect visitors against malicious parties. This was an absolute waste of my time.\n    submitted by    /u/freddieleeman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "About two years ago I started at a small/medium business with a few hundred employees. We were almost all on prem, very few cloud services outside of MS365. The company previously had one guy who was essentially \"good with computers\" set things up but they grew to the size where they needed an IT guy full time, which isn't super unusual.\n But the owner was incredibly cheap. When I started they had a few working virtual host servers but they had zero backups - absolutely nothing on prem was being backed up externally. In my first month there I went to the owner and explained how bad things would be if we didn't have any off site backups we were doomed. I looked into free cloud alternatives but there wasn't anything that would fit our needs.\n Management was very clear - the budget for backups is $0, and \"nothing is going to happen, you worry too much\"\n So I decided to do it myself. I figured out how much I could set aside each week and started saving. I didn't make a whole lot but I did have extra money each month. I was determined to have a disaster recovery plan, even if they didn't want to pay for it.\n And some of you may remember, Hurricane Ian hit a few months ago. We were not originally predicted to take the brunt of it, and management wanted no downtime, so we did not physically remove the server from the premises. The storm damaged the building and we experienced some pretty severe data loss. \n So it was time for my disaster recovery plan. The day after, we gathered at the building and discovered the damage. After confirming we had lost data, I said \"I quit,\" I got in my car, and lived off the 6 months of savings I had. Tomorrow I start my new job. Disaster recovery plan worked exactly how I planned.\n    submitted by    /u/disasterrecoverywhat  \n [link]   [comments]",

Essentially, it will be on a website with two options, the main one being to print a label that a user has been emailed. Clicking that button opens the camera and scans a QR code, once code has been read it will prompt the user to click a print label button where i'd like it to silently print said label to an attached label printer. The site is all working and tested fine.\n So i've created an intune profile for the browser, using Microsoft Kiosk Browser app rather than Edge so that it displays fullscreen with no navigation bars etc. There is an additional configuration profile setup to Force Allow the browser access to the camera. The first part works fine, However the print page takes me to an error page (the page works in normal edge so i know it works) the error shows:\n sorry that file type is unsupported blob:[mywebsiteaddress] \n So i'm assuming that the Kiosk Browser app doesn't support printing?.\n If i then change the browser in the configuration profile to MS Edge, printing will work fine, however, its not a full screen browser window and has navigation options, I still get the prompts to allow the camera, and I also get a print dialog screen which i really don't want. \n My questions are:\n  \nCan someone pin point where that first error might come from with regards to printing in the Kiosk Browser app\n If not, is there a way or an option that im missing to force edge into full screen mode and allow the camera access and disable the print screen.\n  \nThe Kiosk Browser is the prefered option.\n    submitted by    /u/slothmeister  \n [link]   [comments]",

Essentially undoing the dedupe.\n My Archive server has 1.1TB free space on the data volume (which is the same size as our production file server at 2TB) and also has deduplication service enabled.\n I do have the capability to spin backups of these VMs up in a lab to test the move works but with that amount of data it will take quite some time, so hoping someone here can provide some insight into their experience moving similar sized datasets.\n Cheers\n GD\n    submitted by    /u/Gh0styD0g  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As the title says, what makes you believe online password managers like LastPass, 1Password etc are really end to end encrypted, there are no intentional backdoors or that they won't sell your passwords to any 3rd party? Is it just their privacy policy? \n Or is it just the fact that the benefits of using a password manager at all greatly outweighs the risks of password manager company \"turning to the dark side\"?\n By using a password manager, you are in fact completely trusting your digital identity and privacy to them. If I were any government's agency, I'd sponsor my own password manager so that all people are willingly handing their identities over to me and I wouldn't even need to move a finger...\n Personally, I'm using KeePass which is open source so that much wider community is able to review it's code for possible weaknesses and, more importantly, backdoors. I'm also using a composite master key to unlock the database. One part is stored locally on my devices while the other part is a password that I regularly type. This way I can keep my password reasonably short for greater convenience and still practically impossible to brute-force by anyone that could possible get hold of my database. This enables me to keep the database in the cloud, which I also do not trust.\n    submitted by    /u/peca89  \n [link]   [comments]",

We also have an insane amount of file shares because of each raid.\n Would a scale out solution like CEPH or GlusterFS be a better solution? Would we be better off keeping RAID configurations? What other solutions could provide for this?\n I had a hard time wrapping my head around which solution would be best because of I/O density/etc.\n We aren't against vendor supported builds but would prefer to learn and grow our experiences in storage to provide direct support later down the road and grow our professional portfolios.\n Funding and time aren't huge issues, and we've been given some funds to build a small \"proof of concept\" for whichever system we can find that fits the criteria. This would include training/etc.\n    submitted by    /u/CameHonor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We have a LoB app that uses the %TEMP% location to save attachment content for emails. User clicks task in the app, a %TEMP%/123/45678.pdf is created (both 123 folder, and 45678.pdf). Once done the app seems to rename the contract_90123.pdf. effective permissions also show full access for this location.\n That rename appears to be intermittently failing, so the expected attachment isnt present and the email fails to generate. procmon shows 'path not found' on the rename operation.\n From the information i've gathered so far, it's an infrequent failure but when it happens appears to occur for a period of time. We appear to be fine for a week but last week we had it occur for all generated email attachments and was 100% reproducable.\n The infra is RDS2019 (6 servers) using UPD's, which runs on S2D storage. %TEMP% was not originally included in the UPD but as of an hour ago now included for testing. I doubt that will have any fix due. There's no apparent heavy resource usage or noticable performance issues when the issue occurs to suspect heavy load.\n We seem to have no other issues on the RDS's other than this rename operation failing. Running the app locally also has no problems. LoB support say it's an issue with our environment and with it only occuing on our RDS's, i'm inclined to beleive them.\n Any sugestions on what to do to further diagnose this one? due to the seeming isolated file, i'm out of ideas as anything i can come up with (eg: bad disk/ram/network) would affect far more than this.\n    submitted by    /u/veehexx  \n [link]   [comments]",

One day the server's PSU fell over, and while one on-site tech was fixing it the office manager/company director asked \"has the server failed because there's too much WiFi?\".

But does it only query the web-page and pull the Apache version that way or is there more going on under the hood?\n I'm not able to find any .nasl script files for these plugins either, so if you could point me to a resource where these exist, that'd help too.\n    submitted by    /u/basonjourne98  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is the best scenario to have one or the other?\n - Does OCSP respond if the current client certificate is valid? Is this statement valid for regular CRL CDP as well? How do clients knows to check the ocsp? Is it embedded on the certificate as an AIA point?\n - I have noticed that when setting up the AIA you always point it to the root CA certificate, why is that? Regular CDP point to .crl files but not AIA.\n - If I don't set up a custom IIS server with CRL, do clients pull it from default points such as LDAP? is IIS custom CDP best practice for DMZ external clients where LDAP is not accessible? why CRLs cannot be accessed through HTTPS?\n - What is the objective of using multiple SANs in a certificate?\n - What are the considerations when migrating CAs to other servers? Does it work by backing up old CA, turn off the server CA, create the new one, install role, restore CA registry backup but manitaining IP and server name? Would that keep the default CDP and AIA settings as well as matching DNS zone records. What about the IIS servers hosting enrollment and CDPs if any? What about the NDES role if it is present?\n - Can I change renewal key lenght on capolicy.inf if certificates are required to increase key length? Is there another way to do it? What tasks are needed to be done after that?\n - What is Certificate Transparency what are CT logs? How does ADCS implements it?\n What is a CAA NS record, and how does Microsoft implements it in DNS or ADCS?\n I'd be thanking anyone who can help on answerings these questions as I am really curious about the topic.\n    submitted by    /u/erudes91  \n [link]   [comments]",

At some point with the newer os’s, won’t I encounter one(like 2019, 2022?) that won’t recognize or allow the new server to become a secondary dc to the existing primary one running such an old functional level?

I see 3 options here, which are below:\n  \nPurchase a step-up transformer to plug into the 120v outlet, to give the UPS 240v output\n Use two different out-of-phase outlets on different circuits and wire them to a single 240v plug\n Pay an electrician to run a new circuit dedicated for the UPS\n  \nObviously Option 3 is the most ideal option, but running a new circuit will be somewhat difficult and expensive due to the layout of my house. Option 2 sounds sketchy as hell, but should theoretically work (I have two different circuits in the server room).

Am I the asshole or do I have one as neighbour?\n ​\n Any advise, pat on the back or other form of moral support is appreciated :]\n    submitted by    /u/sbudde  \n [link]   [comments]",

General infra like VMware, storage, sysadmin etc. I have moved to use the cloud in the last 7 years as well. I have (finally) been promoted and now find myself Head of Infrastructure. It's a lofty title for what I actually do but it's good. I have two teams I supervise, an infra team of more classic sysadmins, and a DevOps team which is developers who are interested and work in infra stuff. My role is extremely hands-on around 50% still doing infrastructure engineering but I am gaining more staff so that will continue to reduce with time.\n I am planning for the future and looking at similar roles to see what I need to be aiming for. What I am interested in right now is what sort of interview questions should I expect for these sorts of roles. Since I didn't interview for my Head of role I've never had a management interview. \n What are the general questions I should expect, is there any changes to my interview style over engineering roles I need to anticipate? (I found being extremely relaxed and personable worked very well, but I understand cultural differences here come into play as London and Stockholm, where I have worked, are very relaxed environments for engineering roles where that might not be the case where you are from). Any other general advice anybody might have?\n ​\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/codechris  \n [link]   [comments]",

This issue is at 12 hours odd now, to still be in the investigation stage says they know what’s wrong, it’s big, they don’t have a fix, or, they have no clue, which 12 hours in is a worry. \n At this point, if you have users in rack space hosted email, I’d be looking at standing up a new solution to give functionality from now, and worry about historic data later - I fear this may not be a quick fix, or even something with a full fix. \n I can’t think of anything that would create a 12 hour outage of exchange/hosted exchange that’s still in investigation (figuring out wtf is wrong) beyond something that is known, and the investigation is how the fuck do we unfuck this!\n Be prepared for the worst, hope for the best!\n    submitted by    /u/jimbobmccoy779  \n [link]   [comments]",

Today we use PDQ Deploy + Inventory and love it, but it's limited to on-net management. PDQ Connect is coming and looks like it's going in a good direction, but I've got almost 1,000 PC's to a manage now, so I'm open to alternatives - and the solution that keeps coming up is Microsoft Intune. \n We would like an application deployment solution that is flexible but will also let us run Powershell scripts, create groups and reports, and ideally provide a way to access the remote computer over the internet. Bonus if it works for Mac as well as Windows (though we are 99% Windows). One of the things I've seen with Intune that I really like is the ability to create PC profiles and once a user logs in to Azure AD, Intune (or Autopilot?) automatically deploys a profile to the computer. That seems powerful. \n Other thoughts on Intune as a potential alternative (or accompaniment?) to PDQ?\n    submitted by    /u/nakedmeeple  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our phone provider (a voip pbx provider using voip.ms as their trunk) says they are not able to identify the original number but have confirmed the numbers are spoofed. The attacker calls periodically and berates the receptionist looking for some information that we don't have, and has told her they will jam up our switchboards until we give them the information. This has been going on for about 3 weeks. The caller has said they are in south africa, though the numbers they call from are 10 digit north american numbers. My receptionist took it on herself to give the attacker some fake information that she thought might satiate them, but it was quickly identified as false and seemed to enrage them further.\n I discussed this with the RCMP (canadian police force) and they were able to call to one of the numbers that the attacker had called from and speak to them and told them to stop. However that was about as effective as you'd expect. The RCMP said there was nothing additional that they could do and to contact the anti-fraud division (which I'm going to be doing today with limited expectations for success)\n So, given that I am not able to block the calls as the call ID keep changing and my phone provider isn't able to identify the actual source of the calls in order to provide to law enforcement, what options remain?\n    submitted by    /u/e7c2  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was an issue with the previous version of the AV client that would fill the drive with shadow copies, however this was resolved in the latest patch.\n We believe that there is still space allocated to, or hidden shadow copies, however windows reports that only approx. 90gb is used for shadow copies.\n We're stumped on this one, any ideas?

Has anyone else felt this way? It's like imposter syndrome but only because I'm doing better than some others.\n I can usually find the answer to any problem or work with the right people effectively to solve most issues but I feel like I'm lazy, I make mistakes, I don't go after certifications, I don't homelab, I have lukewarm social skills, I'm not amazing at interviews, I don't network very well, my written skills are average at best, I can't clearly state my thoughts to executives, and sometimes I'm just overall inefficient at my job. \n Yet I know I'm capable of doing my current job without a doubt, but I worry about being replaced by someone better constantly.\n So when I see someone stuck in a T1 job for like 4 years, it makes me question whether or not I deserve to be in IT Manager role after only 6 years.

I never really liked IT, but was generally good at it and it paid well. The best jobs are when I had a fun team, worst have been from bad management. I eventually change jobs for whatever reason: company closing, management, bored, whatever. I have always thought about changing professions during my career, but I don’t know if I would feel better doing that or not. Or have any idea what I would do anyway. I don’t like the idea of continually changing jobs, especially in my 50s, I average about 2-3 years per job, but I am pretty sure I am not in the right place to finish my career in 15-20 years.\n I never felt fulfilled or proud of my career path, and dread mondays and going into the office 3 times a week, but the days go by quickly given that every day is different. All in all, things are ok, I’m hybrid, get paid well, little work outside my 40 hours, my management leaves me alone, I’ve always gotten good reviews when I had them. I don’t really connect with my team, and fear I would be released if layoffs come. Some days, it’s a struggle staying above water from both the complexity and quantity of work, most days I stare at the clock waiting for quitting time.\n For the most part I’ve been an admin: windows, linux, storage, virtualization, cloud, and dabbled a bit in of security, databases, scripting, networking.

          "description": "I find that I get along really great with my end users and I can explain most of the issues in layman's terms but when working on a larger team of system engineers or very techy people they look at me like I am an idiot or I just do not mesh well with them.\n I had a job for three months with an MSP and none of the techs liked me there. I got fired due to culture fit. At my current job I am bashing with my bosses boss as well as an app consultant because I am asking questions or detailing the frustrations that the users have with our equipment and software when it seems like nothing is getting fixed.\n How do you learn how to keep your head down and work with technologies or even people you think are inferior? Is it the fact that I don't have the knowledge that I think I do? Is it the politics of crappy workplaces? I have 8-10 years of IT exp and still generally help desk support at various roles/companies, could that be the reason? \n Why do I think IT should be about investigating problems and making sure they get fixed and do not reoccur when in reality it is actually about putting bandaids on things until you can't take it anymore and leave? I guess this is why they call hell desk hell.

          "description": "Hi guys. Our company is evaluating the transition from on prem servers to cloud servers, and I'd like to ask for your advice. Our current environment includes 2 sites while each site has 1 Windows server (to work as DC, DHCP and print server) + 1 Windows file server. GPOs are in place to mount network drives and printers. We also have NSA to work as firewalls and VPN connections for remote users.\n Our major plan is to replace the file servers with Nasuni edge appliances. That will bring us 'small cache file server' to each location. But the executives are considering replacing the current DCs to cloud VM. \n From my premature understanding of cloud resources, this looks possible by running a VM with site-to-site VPN connection to on prem networks. Remote users will still connect VPN before they could reach the DC for authentication. But would there be any issues/concerns for the features like AD, printing, DNS, GPO, etc.?\n    submitted by    /u/Tonyluo2001  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then they forgot the code.. and the devices had already been deleted from airwatch....\n I've looked online and all I really see are jailbreakers and paid pin unlock suites, I'm wondering if anyone knows of a free tool that can either remove the pin, or fully factory reset the devices (I've tried iTunes and the usual recovery with no joy), or if there is a way to re-enroll the devices back into airwatch temporarily to use the pin removal tool?\n    submitted by    /u/afwmftw  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m six months into this new job and have suddenly been thrown into a couple projects. \n Unfortunately for me, my boss threw me into an ongoing project cycle due to one of our sys admins being out for several weeks, so I’m in the fire. I’ve been given a technical documentation by our vendor which I’m told is full of useless and confusing information and I need to basically decipher and translate it to work for the environment we have. I’m still new to our environment and applications so figuring out how to make this work within our infrastructure is extremely daunting. There are people I can ask for help but many of them are busy with their own tasks and projects and I don’t want to come off as helpless. \n The company I work for is ridiculously understaffed and unorganized, so there is zero structure or timeline to these projects as well as very conflicting deadlines. I’ve literally been asked if it was possible to take this new project given to me and implement the entire thing in a non prod environment within 24 hours, no freaking way. All the while being asked by product managers and my boss for constant updates on other projects assigned to me. It’s extremely soul crushing. I’m so new to everything that it seems impossible to get anything done within the time frames they’re asking for and give updates. The micro managing is extremely severe to the point where I am asked for a project update every single hour, most of the time I’m still trying to figure out what to do and don’t have an answer. If I’m lucky one of the more senior guys will schedule a meeting with me later in the day to point me in the right direction. I’m starting to feel like I’m just not smart enough for this role and want out of IT completely because it seems like I run into this same issue with every job.\n    submitted by    /u/ShowIllustrious5373  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there,\n I am a sysadmin in a company and I manage around ~170 Servers. Some of them are phyiscal, some virtual. Most of them run Windows Server 2012 / 2016 /2019 as their OS, but we also got some Linux Servers.\n So now our issue: We literally got almost no documention for our servers. We have list of our hostnames, but that is it.\n To better understand our current state: Recently our main FTP Server broke down because the Windows OS was broken. The server was not bootable anymore and therefore the config for the FTP server (IIS) was lost. Of course, no one knew how the FTP Service was configured in terms of directories, local users and other software. So we build up a new Server from scratch (which was the easy part) and talked to every service provider usising this FTP Server and telling them that the credentials and hostname / IP has changed (which was the not so nice part).\n We recently got the brilliant idea that it might be good to know what kind of Servers we have, which applications they are running and how they are configured.\n The first idea from one of my colleagues was to make a word document for every server, where we can wright the specs inside, which applications it runs and what steps were taken to configure the software (with screenshots). But yeah, let's just not do that....\n And now my question: What is the best practice for Server documentation? I googled a bit of course and found some tools for documentation, but most of them are not free for testing or just don't look that good to use.\n The way to document should have some kind automation to it and have a nice usability, so that my colleagues stay motivated to document.\n So should be just something dull like Word, Excel or Visio (which is easy but frustrating to use) or some kind of software, which scans our servers and document them? I think a hybrid of both things would be nice\n    submitted by    /u/Sp4stie  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a question for publishing printers by site bsaed on the following design requirement:\n Implementing a print release system to use follow-me print across all sites.\n Management want just one print queue published\n We could publish one print queue from one server and allow the system to manage the follow-me function, but there's also the requirement to ensure local print facilities are available in the case of a single site failure / link failure.\n It appears to be a limitation of the system we are using (or the design we've gone with) to have failover across sites - though I am also checking with our managed print provider, as I'm not the project manager just the technical lead.\n Currently using group policy, print perferences then item-level filtering to say if at X site then create printerX@serverX.com\n If at site Y create printerY@serverY.com etc.\n What I'd like to do is avoid a build up of printers in their list though, so if at site X I only want X printer deployed to that device. If they then take that laptop to site Y, deploy printer Y on login but remove printer X. The plan is the queue name would be the same on each server so to the end user it \"looks\" like one queue wherever they go\n Is that even possible? I worry it could increase logon times\n Any other suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/The-Hound-of-Hades  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We use shared local admin accounts with password auth on the infrastructure I inherited (~6 admins, many (hundreds) of machines). This worries me, any ex employee will still have access unless we go and change a lot of passwords. Automation is not really a thing here yet (I know, I know).\n Looking for a better solution I started to create an ansible playbook to roll out authentication via sssd/ldap. This basically works, everyone from the \"sysadmin\" group can now login via ssh and their individual passwords on my test machine. Accounts are automatically granted sudo rights based on group membership.\n Now, I have a couple of questions with respect to this approach:\n  \nIs there a way to preseed the sssd cache before first login? An admin might have to handle an emergency on a machine he’s never logged into and at that moment ldap might not be available. If not, any recommended alternative approaches?\n \nI would prefer key auth over passwords but I don’t have much control over the AD/LDAP infrastructure so I don’t think I can store public keys there (and delegate ssh key lookup / caching to sssd). I could rollout and revoke keys via ansible but I’m unsure on how that would play with sssd/ldap. Like, when an account is locked in AD but still has an authorized key, can they still login?\n \nGiven all admins have sudo rights, what would be required steps to make sure they can't access servers after they left? E.g. would we have to cleanout their authorized_keys in addition to disabling their users in AD/LDAP?\n \n Any inputs are appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/No-Finger-42  \n [link]   [comments]",

I jumped from a systems admin role to IT Manager with only 2.5 years of experience. Even then, I was only handling lower level tickets and worked for an MSP for a year where they literally only had be call Comcast whenever a site went down.. Anyways I feel extremely incompetent as now I’ve been pushed to a director role just 6 months of being here. I just got an intern that I am now training to help me with tasks, but even that requires so much of my time to train on top of dealing with executive meetings and last minute requests from management. \n Anything related with equipment is basically my responsibility even if I have no idea where it came from or how it got purchased. We have a programs team that is the biggest department in our organization and yet they’re the ones that fail to manage their things and I’m now having to take ownership of their mistakes. I wonder how common this is, and what was your experience as a one man/woman IT. \n What has helped you with stepping into a leadership role? I’m currently reading the IT Manager Guidebook since that was the only book I’ve found so far, but even so I’m so freaked out at the fact that I don’t know anything and I have so much yet to learn that it’s so overwhelming. Appreciate any advice/resources that has helped you manage a similar situation.\n (btw no disrespect to my intern when I say “1.5” they are just not fully available to assist me. So still it would be a 2 man IT department, don’t want to diminish their contribution )\n    submitted by    /u/TraditionEven5659  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just today we had an issue where one of the terminal servers went offline and we had to reboot it, causing multiple staff to lose their work. Upon rebooting the server everything looked fine, but we were recieving multiple calls asking if something was down, or if it was safe to log in again.\n I was thinking, it would be great if the IT department had a website we could share with users to just have us post a quick \"this server went down, but services will be restored soon.\" or \"Reminder, we are doing maintenance tonight at 10PM\" messages that staff could view throughout the day. Mostly just a status and maintenance update kind of site that we can send out when there's a known issue and an all clear.\n The purpose would be, of course, if there is something acting up, staff can bring up the page quick and see that there is a problem and what we're doing to resolve, so they do not have to call in or wonder and call us to ask.\n I'm imaging like a live webpage that we can post messages, but have them read only and not allow for replies, new items go to the top and old messages are pushed down over time. Maybe we can mark older issues a resolved and important information like \"If you continue to have issues, please try logging off and back in for better performance.\"\n Anyway, does that make sense? Is there anything like that we can utilize? I know we can send out emails to staff/groups for updates, but many things do not need to go to all staff, and not all staff need to be aware of issues impacting just certain groups or applications. We were thinking maybe Teams would have something like that, but even so Teams seems a bit underwhelming for that. I'm thinking just a landing page where we can push out quick updates.\n    submitted by    /u/This_guy_works  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey! Quick context. The company I work at NEVER deletes anything from AD. From disabled accounts to old computers/servers, they just disable them and let them be (they been doing this for like 10+ years).\n A couple months ago we started a project to clean everything and we still havent found a way to safely delete every disabled user/system (they never do it especially cause they hire a lot of consultants and a lot of them come and go and they just enable/disable their users).\n Pretty cool thing I just discovered (mind I have 0 exp on the area Im literally new on the job) is that you can export/import users. So I thought about exporting them, storage them in any fileserver and delete them from AD. If we ever decide to use them again we just import them with their groups and stuff like they where when we disabled it. Would this work?. \n Another suggestion we had was to make \"parallel OUs\" and storage every disabled/thing in the same OU with some kind of designated name like \"Logistic Users - Disabled\" or something like that. But this would still invovle having EVERY disabled thing still there.\n ​\n What do you guys do to keep AD clean?.\n Is there any tool to keep track of disabled/enabled users? I just use powershell for everything but Im sure theres a more efficient way.\n    submitted by    /u/RoloRolando  \n [link]   [comments]",

The owners of the 3000+ people company I work for bought three small companies (around 60 people total) about a month ago and want to merge those companies into one new company (our company will operate independently) with a new domain, Azure tenant, email, etc. IT was not involved in any of the initial discussions until the deal closed. We were told to drop everything and focus on this project but as other teams complain up the chain, the drop everything and focus on the merger goes out the window.\n ​\n This project needs to get done by December 31st and there's no leeway on that time. We talked to some consulting companies and even they say getting it done by end of the year, especially with the US holidays is not possible. We have also been told that if this doesn't get done by end of the year, we may all be looking for new jobs. Oh, did I mention that we still do not have any access to the other companies yet to even start any migration, IT from the other companies are dragging their feet with this information.\n ​\n I guess this is where the rant/frustration comes in, but with a message like that from our management and a timeline that does not seem achievable by companies that dedicate their business to mergers (consultants), I don't get what chance our small and understaffed team of IT people have at getting this done by end of the year.

This server does not host any DNS/DHCP services and is only running Avigilon server. Any ideas what may be causing this behavior?\n    submitted by    /u/NancyPelosisVagina  \n [link]   [comments]",

I consider myself reasonably intelligent and have been working rather successfully towards industry certifications. Now, as many of you rightly point out, certifications don't equal experience. All they serve to do is fill gaps in my theory, such as being unaware of how networking works until studying OSI model, TCP, etc.\n So the question then becomes, how do I learn how to do things right? Many folks on here talk about homelabbing, and I'm slowly but surely spinning up things with Azure credits and Raspberri Pis, but at the end of the day, all of my work relies on internet research. If some yahoo on StackOverflow says to set it up one way or another, there's little I can do to verify that this is a conceptually sound process, because I lack the experience - I don't know what I don't know.\n Of course, many people would next say 'get the experience.' But how can one do that if one does not have the experience to get the job in the first place? That is to say, my goal is working my way into systems administration. In such a job they might want me to produce an effective backup storage solution, but if my knowledge comes from tainted sources, how can I do this?

Those apps source the SMTP Adress from the AD mail property. I really don't like this setup, but that's something grown.\n However, this is making some trouble with syncing to the cloud, since those SMTP adresses are already registerd with the tenant of the supplier, which makes absolutely sense. But we need those accounts synced to AAD, because we're using AAD as Identity Provider (IdP) for several apps.\n Qeustion to the community?\n How have you solved a challenge like this?\n From my point (Exchage/AD) I can only imagine a solution with Exchange mailboxes for those users with a forwarding to their primary work address. But thils will cost a license in the future, when we move those mailboxes to Exchange Online.

Now we would like to utilise Inactive Mailbox instead.\n We are running Hybrid Exchange, so to my knowledge to create an inactive mailbox, this is the process:\n  \nMove the user account to an OU that is not synced to Azure AD while the account is licensed in O365.\n This will cause the account to be deleted in Azure AD while licensed. The license then goes back into the pool and the mailbox is converted to inactive mailbox.\n We can then disable the user account in On-Prem AD and then delete it later on.\n  \nRetention Policy has been setup in Microsoft Purview to retain items indefinitely.\n My questions are:\n  \nIf you remove the license then delete/unsync the account from Azure AD, will it still create inactive mailbox?\n We used to convert user accounts to shared mailboxes so we have disabled users objects in our Active Directory.

I decided to leave this job due to being the only on site IT resource, which required 7 day weeks with 10 hours on site and the rest on-call from Black Friday through New Years Eve without receiving any extra pay during those times. In addition this company treats IT needs with extremely low priority until an outage stops production, and kept moving my office anytime someone decided they wanted that space (currently I am in a mice-infested storage closet). \n I found out late last week that they will not be able to hire a replacement for me until after the new year aside from a weekend temp that has almost no IT experience (weekday needs will be covered remotely by the already-stretched-thin corporate office). This is likely to mean outages that will cause them to miss SLAs and put an already threatened facility perilously close to being shut down. \n Should I feel guilty about this? I’m getting lots of guilt trips but find myself not really giving a crap. \n My wife suggested offering to do consultant work for them on my off hours, but called me an asshole for saying that I wouldn’t even think about it for less than $250 an hour.\n Edit: For those questioning if the office moves were real, here are some photos (censored so I don’t dox myself): https://imgur.com/a/CnPwoiu/\n    submitted by    /u/infinite_zero  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All,\n Our small organization has been archiving media content with our own tape library as a standard practice for some time solely dedicated to our ingest/post-production footage, now we are expanding tape backup writing for other non-critical departments.\n The other departments have had a few TBs backed up in their \"unlimited\" (Google) cloud storage using our corporate network for a few years, now we need a mechanism to access the content in the cloud and download them to an on-premise storage machine with access to writing to the tape library. Additionally, a checksum validation of the files should be done after writing to tape. \n So far we expect existing content to be around 12-15TB for the newly included department, the data is expected to grow to maybe 20-25% per year. This content will need to be stored for 8 years for data compliance, and we cannot maintain a single (cloud) copy for their department, hence writing to tape is a hard requirement here. \n What we have so far as a current setup is, \n  \nMac machine with an in-built storage of maybe 500GB free space currently.\n Access to the cloud content via the desktop application (Google Drive).\n Standalone tape writer with connectivity to the mac via thunderbolt 2 (We don't have the infra for a windows system to connect to standalone tape writer as of now)\n Rewritable LTO-7 Tapes @ 15TB capacity\n  \nFull disclosure, on our side of IT we have not been looking into the tape writing side until this requirement came up. On a high level, this new project seems to be very tedious as the backup will be of many individual objects, and not sure whether an MD5 checksum for a list of files contained in a folder using the mac terminal is possible, or if somebody can suggest a safe third-party software app. \n Would like to know what will be the best approach here? Is using the mac as the storage medium the best option also? We don't plan on investing in external hardware.\n    submitted by    /u/Klipspringer112  \n [link]   [comments]",

Essentially I have a dotted line to IT, but other than back end things like HR and email, I am responsible for everything else. I’ve been doing it for over a decade so in some sense I don’t have imposter syndrome directly in the role, but at the same time I don’t have deep professional IT experience, and just get by on my own. I leverage a consultant for engineering and largely perform systems administration and support in addition to my others roles. I’m lacking in best practices, oversight and auditing, and ultimately feel like an amateur due to no one requiring anything from me other than “are things working?” \n I’ve managed fine, overseeing and supporting 9 physical offices, virtual infrastructure and workforce etc, but I feel like I can’t get another job because I’ve largely done everything on my own with little direction and just keeping everything working with the bare minimum. \n How can I prepare myself for a potential job within an actual IT department with IT professionals that likely have more knowledge than me? And how do I accomplish that without going backwards? I’ve leveraged myself into a senior leadership position within the org beyond just IT, with a heavy emphasis on operational project management and strategic planning (non-IT). \n Ultimately I don’t feel like I have the skills I need to be successful and I don’t want to be where I am forever.

          "description": "So we manage sites along the retail/hospitality line that have guest wifi. We normally see maybe 1-2 DDOS attacks per year. We do not host any domains, or any services for that matter, that would allow someone to find out the IP's of the sites remotely. Except for a select few, none of the IP's are SWIP'd in arin either.\n So that leads me to be believe someone on the guest wifi at these sites does something to piss someone off on the internet, or its a random/driveby/typo. Typically they are short lived, single incident or maybe two within an evening/day.\n Its almost always in 1hr or 2 hour intervals, which leads me to believe its a DDOS for hire type thing. Always volumetric, so dns/udp/icmp reflection/fragmentation. So since its volumetric and these sites dont have bgp, there isnt anything we can do from our end.\n Most providers arent that helpful, because they want you to pay for their DDOS protection service, which is normally at least 2x+ the MRC of the actual internet service itself.\n Dealing with one now that is lumen/centurylink. Had an event Monday evening, then again last night (didnt notice this as it was 12am) and now this evening again. We stopped using the IP they were hitting, changed the NAT pool to a new IP, but they are still hitting the old IP. To their credit they did do some filtering Monday, but said it was a one time thing and we needed to talk to our account rep. Looking at the bandwidth graph on the lumen portal, looks like it starts out at over 1gbps, but then settles in around 700-800mbps, and we only have 500mbps at the site. Im inclined to just go to 1gbps if im going to throw money at something, but they could just throw more DDOS at it at that point.\n Anyone have any thoughts on this other than it sucks?

The sysadmin I worked for had a red flag come up and had to fire someone and was torn up because the guy was a genius and it was right before Christmas holiday break. We drank heavily about it. Then after we came back to the office he had to clean out the guys office and put it into a box and discovered the biggest pile of pornography known to man he had created on thousands of CDs, disks, zip drives. They found the guy had written macros completely automating his job and spent 100% of his time collecting, indexing and catologing porn for absolutely no reason. \n If I recall right ( I was drunk when told so could be wrong ) the company had to call the police incase anything illegal was on the disks but it was so much they didn't have the time/budget to go through it all. They tried speaking with the guy but he had moved out of state when his building access got locked. \n In the end the sysadmin got the full fury of the company for not knowing what was going on and the poor admin spent 2-3 months 7 days a week working to create and implement new security processes and traveling to every branch to install them.\n The guy was only caught because one of our female coworkers had been in the adult industry briefly when she was younger and he somehow recognized her ( they said he had a photographic memory ) and accessed the HR database on her home addresse which was monitored by law.\n I will say this for the company. They put the sysadmin through 3 months of hell but once he finished they gave him a promotion and paid vaca.\n Edit: Because people are saying he stalked her. The sysadmin was able to speak with him once via his mother and the guy said he wasn't trying to stalk her only to put her address into the index he made. He was brilliant but OCD about data.

So I got approval from the IT manager to audit all login/logoff/login failure activity and put it in a database.\n So, I turned the auditing GPO's on, however they feel very junky and the login failure logging doesn't even seem to work. Current issues:\n - Someone logs in and event viewer logs it 4 times and than it says the account logged out 3 times, even though all he did was log in once.- Someone fills in bad passwords, but nothing appears in the event viewer even though the GPO's are turned on for auditing/logging this.\n Is there a way to make it more reliable and work? Or is there a better option that I'm unaware of?\n ​\n Edit: I'm just a junior network and sysadmin, they won't even bother listening to me implementing a paid system since I'm very new to the company. I've been working on making a Powershell script that nitpicks and exports the Event Viewer data to the DB and from there on to a Grafana Dashboard.

It’s all well and good if it’s just personal productivity gains like automating some sort of spreadsheet processing but when it’s creating or modifying data that multiple people use we obviously have a problem of not knowing where it originates or what to do when a person vacates. \n From doing some Googling it seems to be a bit of grey area with Microsoft licensing as to whether it is appropriate to set up what would essentially be a service account managed by IT to run all these Power Automate tasks and allowing users access to it. Has anyone else managed to solve the issue in their environment of centralizing Power Automate?\n    submitted by    /u/UniqueArugula  \n [link]   [comments]",

That share had logs being read by a PowerShell scheduled task which filtered the important data and outputted a CSV, which then hopped to another server that had network access to write to the final destination for the admin assistant to get it and provide daily numbers to the CEO, mystery solved and I hate it, but also thanks all, your suggestions were very helpful!\n    submitted by    /u/Low-calAdministrator  \n [link]   [comments]",

Depending on the workload of your DCs and the amount of time since the last restart of the server, LSASS might continually increase memory usage with the up time of your server and the server might become unresponsive or automatically restart. Note: The out-of-band updates for DCs released November 17, 2022 and November 18, 2022 might be affected by this issue.\n Workaround: To mitigate this issue, open Command Prompt as Administrator and use the following command to set the registry key KrbtgtFullPacSignature to 0:\n reg add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\KDC\" -v \"KrbtgtFullPacSignature\" -d 0 -t REG_DWORD \n Note: Once this known issue is resolved, you should set KrbtgtFullPacSignature to a higher setting depending on what your environment will allow. It is recommended to enable Enforcement mode as soon as your environment is ready. For more information on this registry key, please see KB5020805: How to manage Kerberos protocol changes related to CVE-2022-37967.\n Next steps: We are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release.\n    submitted by    /u/maxcoder88  \n [link]   [comments]",

All of the virtual machines still running without disks basically. The storage server basically died on me while I was asleep at home. After fixing issues with the storage server (some faulty hardware and a failing RAID), I powered back on our hypervisors and started restoring from backups.\n For a minute, I thought we lost all of our data, all of our servers, and were not going to be able to bring anything back online for a few days. But I was able to fix everything wrong with the storage server (since the power issue was due to a PCIe card failing, and did maintainence) and bring back online most of our VMs without issue. The only VM we lost was a test server that was created that night. \n Although I was able to recover basically everything, I still have decided to improve our backups and retention system. It was a life safer this time but I think we definitely could have better backups. \n It's things like this that make you not regret doing the extra work for backups and fail safes (even if they might suck to set up at times). Made me definitely feel good about my backup systems and plan in case this kinda thing happens.

          "description": "I've been looking for views on this and keep seeing conflicting points. Some say everything should be virtual, others suggest a physical DC.\n The issue we're trying to address is at present all our DCs are virtual - all our hypervisors are Hyper-V\n We recently did a full shutdown to carry out some electrical work. What we realized is that if the DCs didn't come backup automatically for whatever reason with the hypervisor then we wouldn't be able to authenticate with domain credentials onto the Hyper-V host.\n Alternatively I guess we could use local admin, but we use LAPs so again we need domain access to pull up the local admin password.\n As a bonus question - we have a Veeam backup solution which is also currently virtualised. Again my question is should this be physical? It's not using tapes, just backing up to separate SANs.\n If we couldn't get into our virtual environment, we wouldn't be able to do anything with our Veeam backups? We'd have to quickly build a Veeam server to access and restore our backups? Am i missing something\n    submitted by    /u/The-Hound-of-Hades  \n [link]   [comments]",

Which I obviously recommend. \n And as I listened how very preventably and with constant complaints to managment somebody ended falling in boiling acid, I couldn't help but be thankful. I worked in a lot of poorly configured environments, poor security, poor performance, poor management... Who hasn't. And I have also fucked up a few times. Who hasn't. \n But NOBODY IS GOING TO DIE if I don't convince management to fix a big issue, nobody is going to die if I fuck. Productivity will be lost, Data may be lost. You may get screamed at, you may be fired, your company may even go under. But nobody is going to be seriously injured.

During the time they say the issues are happening, no maintenance, or backups are occurring. Something tells me to check the routes on the customer edge router at the site and I see that all of iBGP learned routes are recently learned. Flapping has crossed my mind so I check the logs, and around the same time users “lose”connectivity to the sites, one can see BFD adjacencies going down between the CE spoke and a WAN reflector we have in another location. \n Interestingly enough, the websites users are attempting to access are not suppose to be learned via iBGP. They are externally redistributed in EIGRP. During the issue, when checking the time of the EIGRP routes, they are days old. So how could users not have access to the sites? When you run a trace to the website during the issue, it makes it there. When you check the ISP vrf, the route to the PE is still there. No circuit issues are seen. \n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/Busy-Recipe9840  \n [link]   [comments]",

Obviously there are several VLANs within it, but we have to propagate them over the backbone links, preventing us from segmenting the network.\n The problem is the following: every time we put a new PC on the network, it starts a NetBIOS boradcast storm that propagates to all our switches, causing us many problems. We have intercepted the packet with WireShark and we are certain that this is the problem, what we don't understand is why the packet continues to run even after disconnecting the offending PC. We have already taken steps to put in the broacast limits (storm constrain etc) but we would prefer to solve the problem at the source.\n Has anyone ever had a similar problem? Is there any way to prevent the storm, apart from disabling NetBIOS? Could this be due to a malware installed on one of our networked devices?\n Thanks to all those who will respond!\n    submitted by    /u/MasterrdaM  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, \n I was watching a video on switches that stated a switch can store MAC Addresses in it's CAM table after there has been an attempt to communicate from A to B and then a reply from B to A. That would store the MAC addresses of both A and B, but if this is the first time either of these are communicating on the switch I assume it would have to broadcast the entire message from A to B to all ports (similar to a hub) and listen for where the reply comes to map B to it's proper port. If that is true could that be a security risk? \n My other thought is that it would just be one frame (since after first frame it would all be routed directly A to B) so it might not be a huge deal. All of this for the main question of is it possible to have the switch send essentially a \"discovery\" frame to every port and map the replies so that it wouldn't have to send an initial message to all ports. \n I also think I may be overthinking a relatively miniscule detail but it just caught my attention and was curious.

          "description": "Hey all. I hope this is the right place to ask.\n I am developing what has turned into a small mmo. Every tick of the server sends an update packet for the actors to each connected client. There are other times a server will queue packets for other events to download partial compressed contents (zip) for the next area if the player does not have it. \n The network code is very simple. We use UDP and have our own packet processor that handles queuing, waiting, sorting, chunking packets for various data-types types. \n Lately more players are reporting a lag. The servers are taking longer to reply, some cannot start isolated P2P combat sessions when they could before, and so on. I have no expertise in this area except for the protocols I've read about and network architecture to for games. \n Is it possible that ISP's are throttling unrecognized packet types? Since our packet structure is in-house, and each one varies, my hunch is the ISP is scrutinizing and scanning this traffic because it looks suspicious. I wonder if we wrap our packets in a well-known protocol like WebRTC for instance, if we'd get faster response times. \n The code itself isn't the culprit because the players reporting the issues are using the latest client which has not changed in a year now. If it's possible the packets are being throttled, my next step will address that. But if it's not likely, then I will need to consider other factor causing online stability issues.\n    submitted by    /u/legalizekittens  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has a single nic\n that terminates on a security VLAN on just that one switch. \n If I leave all VLAN's trunked across the peer link then eth1/1 gets flagged as an orphan port. If I prune the security VLAN from the peer link then that flag is removed. \n My question is...is there any downside to just leaving the VLAN on the peer link and having an orphan port? If the peer link goes down nothing would happen to an orphan port or non-orphan port by default and we want this port to stay up if the peer-link fails. If the entire switch fails then we would have to physically move the uplink to eth1/1 on the secondary so that traffic would leave out that path.\n Correct me if I am wrong, but I feel like the orphan port concept is more geared toward active/passive devices where you want to explicitly shut a port on a switch that has shut its vPC ports to prevent black holing of traffic.\n    submitted by    /u/wobbypetty  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use Azure AD Connect to sync on prem AD to Azure. \n The idea is this -\n If our Main site's SonicWall were to go down, the boss would like for users to be able to seamlessly connect to the disaster recovery site without needing to change binding/URLs.\n How it works now -\n If the Main SonicWall were to go down, users can type in the URL to the secondary (DR Site) SonicWall's VPN Office Portal. From here they can bind their TOTP, then log into NetExtender, change the \"server\" on Net Extender to the DR site's URL, and log in with their credentials using the DR sites 2FA token.\n How they want it to work - \n Main SonicWall goes down, users go to the same URL and can use the same 2FA token to login. Users would not have to change the \"Server\" on Net Extender. \n I'm planning on setting up Radius regardless, and I'm looking into alternatives like Azure AD 2FA with NPS, though I'm having a hard time finding articles/research to help me achieve what I need to accomplish here. Anyone able to offer suggestions/ link articles that could nudge me in the right direction? My experiencing with load balancing is not the best I'll admit.\n    submitted by    /u/CorrectExcuse2547  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been advised by the provider that this is an 'internet issue' and there's nothing they can do.\n We have multiple 1Gbps internet circuits from the same provider, and an identical test from an alternate circuit shows me getting the full 1Gbps up/down, that to me proves it's something on their network.\n What other tests can I perform to help build my case with the supplier? \n Appreciate any advice\n    submitted by    /u/Mr_Slow1  \n [link]   [comments]",

The customer has two routers from us that are configured with redundancy (VRRP). Recently we tried to configure another gateway on their equipment and we suddenly see a increase in bandwitdh.\n When the VRRP group address is configured on the interface to the customer they only manage to measure 50 down and 50 up, while if we change the IP to one of the available IP's in the range, for example the next IP, the customer suddenly measures 900/900..\n The issue only seems to persist on one of the VLANS that is configured, with a /29 net\n As long as they configure one of the other IP's in the range as their default gateway they have no problems, but if they use the VRRP IP the problem appear.\n My understanding is that for the failover to function properly the customer has to use the VRRP IP as their default gateway, or else the clients dont know where to send their packets if R1 fails.\n I would greatly appreciate any tips for this problems.\n Keep in mind that I am new to this so my explanation may be lacking.\n    submitted by    /u/Snuusern  \n [link]   [comments]",

There's an online process and constant handshake that needs to be maintained and so my idea won't work. But this has opened up other ideas that are theoretically easier. Appreciate the responses!!\n ***Original\n If I am a complete idiot for this line of thinking please don't hesitate to let me know.\n I am currently running two identical separate networks (Main and Backup) each with only two machines on them - one \"controller\" and one \"server\". These networks are very static both logically and physically. Always the same computers.\n Everything is on the same subnet and the controllers can be any IP I want but the servers have to be the same IP. If they're not the same IP I have to do a ridiculous amount of reconfiguring every time I copy things from Main to Backup.\n Here's my question:\n Is there a way I can send the same TCP/IP to two identical networks or IP addresses?\n I was thinking about getting a 4-port mini PC and trying to use PureData to create a routing system and trying to use Mac addresses but maybe there's an easier way? Or maybe this won't ever work at all (because of what I say next)?\n I realize this is a situation that networking is generally designed to avoid but this isn't a typical data network - it's a live show TCP/IP based control network with no external connections and/or surprises.

We are noticing that in some of our load tests, we start seeing our dropped packets start to increment. When we dump the nic statistics in ESXi, we see Rx Missed counters are increasing. Someone told us that the Ring Buffers were dropping packets, and that the solution was to enable Receive Side Scaling (RSS). So we looked into that. \n Inside of the ESXi operating system (VMWare proprietary Linux), the adaptors are using a driver named i40en. The driver is loaded as a kernel module. Per VMWare docs, enabling RSS involves passing parameters to the kernel module. We noticed there were two RSS Parameters (DRSS and RSS), which led us down a path of trying to figure out which one we needed to be configuring. We learned that there are two types of Receive Side Scaling: NetQ (RSS), and Default Queue RSS, the latter being newer. Since we didn't see any mention of DRSS in the Intel X710 documentation, we proceeded to set the RSS values to 4 queues per adaptor. We re-ran the test expecting a Eureka result, but nope - we still see the Rx Missed. \n On this issue, we keep flapping between VMWare (who owns the OS), Cisco (who owns the server) and Intel (who makes the X710 adaptor). Can anyone shed any insight on this Rx Missed issue, and point us in a direction to go down that might fix this issue? We have to figure this out before we can allow a service to be rolled out.\n    submitted by    /u/Lanky_Barnacle1130  \n [link]   [comments]",

When i create two concurrent flows that go e.g. from h1 to h3 or both from h1 to h3 and from h1 to h4, the bandwidth they get also adds up to close to 1Gbps.\n However, when i concurrently have a flow running from h1 to h3 and one from h2 to h4, their summarized bandwidth is way worse and almost never exceeds 300 Mbps.\n There are some more retransmissions shown in iperf3 in this last scenario as well, but i don't really get why that is and i think that just the workings of congestion control causing a decrease of link utilization to below 30% seems unlikely.\n The retransmissions come in small bursts and those appear only every few seconds on average, which also seems too large of an in-between time to have me think that packet drops are causing this. This sounds more like timeouts, but then there should be quite some ACKs being dropped and why would that be?\n Cubic is configured on all end hosts. RTT measured by ping is mostly between 80 and 130 microseconds.\n Before i dig down further into the depths of congestion control (calculating timeouts and looking at whether the ACKs make it in time), i was wondering whether someone had any insights on whether that is normal behaviour or what else could be happening.\n Both memory and CPU utilization of any of the cores stay below 100%.\n    submitted by    /u/tmp7654  \n [link]   [comments]",

Switch 2 interface for Port-Channel 5 and 6 have repeated state changes and appears to be related. The state change doesn't happen at the same time and is not consistent but does happen almost daily. Also, only the fiber switch side's interface is having this state change.\n Troubleshooting:\n Both fiber switches have been rebooted.\n Swapped the SFP modules from Sw 1 to Sw 2 and vice versa. State change issue remained on Sw 2.\n Only thing I haven't done yet was to move the SFP modules to completely new ports as this is remote site and I'm waiting on an onsite visit to get that accomplished.\n I am aware of the \"why\" this is happening, insofar as the MAC flaps caused by the end users roaming between APs that are on different switches, so it sees the MAC twice. What I'm perplexed on is why it's causing a couple interfaces to constantly drop. The drop is not causing noticeable issues and doesn't bring down the port-channel, just constantly state changing.\n    submitted by    /u/GreedyLunch7206  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n tl;dr: How do you provide internet to multiple locations and have it tie into your main network?\n I want to preface by saying that I have very little networking experience. However, the facility I work for no longer has a network administrator so I'm trying to learn some more of how it's setup. \n Currently, there is one main location, and several satellite locations. From what I understand, the network comes in to the main building, and at some point is literally beamed over to 4 other locations. This is accomplished via emitters and receivers by Ubiquiti. As I've just found out, when one of those receivers goes down, Ubiquiti offers no support to help troubleshoot, or replace if needed. And replacing one involves climbing a long ladder with another ladder to reach the point that the receiver is on, mounting the equipment to the roof at a specific angle, and pointing it at the emitter at a precise point to receive the internet connection. All things that sound really specialized. \n In any case, previously I worked at a school district. There were 19 locations, and no Ubiquiti or something similar wireless emitters in sight. \n My question is, is something like this usually done by getting separate Internet connections configured, one for each building, and tying them into the main network? One of the Ubiquiti receivers is several miles away (so I've been told), I'm actually shocked it works at all. It seems like a really odd way to take care of something that seems mostly self explanatory... but I don't really know what I'm talking about.\n    submitted by    /u/Kiwihara  \n [link]   [comments]",

The PC retains the same IP address all day.\n Lease time is 4 hours, I'm told (can't confirm on my own PC, working from home right now).\n .\n My first thought is that the user closes the lid many times during the day, and the PC will negotiate a renew on the lease when it wakes again. However, my colleagues insist that the PC should retain its IP when going to sleep (not hibernate). My Google skills fall short when trying to confirm this.\n But even if the PC renegotiates every time - it would mean that the user closes their lid every 10 minutes or so during an entire day, and opens it immediately afterwards. This seems extremely unlikely.\n I've asked the DHCP guys at work about this, but they're out of office these days, so I'm trying here meanwhile.\n Does anyone have an input as to why the Logpoint logs show ~150 DHCP entries for a single PC during one work day (assuming normal user behaviour)?\n    submitted by    /u/TerjiD  \n [link]   [comments]",

The organization's main office is moving from one location with multiple one-story buildings to a seven-story office building over the next year or two. Until now, our scheme for data has mostly followed 10.111.X.Y, with X being an arbitrary VLAN ID associated with a specific department and Y being the host. VoIP has typically mirrored that but with a VLAN ID equal to X + 100 (i.e. VLAN 50's voice VLAN is 150), and wireless has been a single VLAN across the entire organization. \n At our new building, we are tentatively planning on sticking with 10.111.X.Y, but with X being an arbitrary VLAN associated with the floor, not the department. The idea is to hopefully simplify management on our end since there will be multiple departments per floor but only one switch stack. We're planning on the same voice VLAN scheme. We're undecided on whether to do a single wireless subnet or one per floor. We're also considering adding another VLAN schema (like X + 200) for various maintenance devices on each floor of the new building, like cameras, HVAC equipment, etc.\n Does this all make sense? Is there a more efficient way of doing this? What's worked in your experience? We don't have too large a number of end users or devices, but we figure if there was ever a time to adjust our addressing it would be now. As a side note, what is standard practice for VPN pools? Right now we are using a completely random range (10.100.20.x). Would it make more sense to use something in the 10.111.x range?

          "description": "I have an HP L3 switch connected to a Cisco L3 switch and am in the process of migrating SVIs. They are connected via 2x10G links in an LACP port-channel. This trunk carries a number of VLANs. There are devices hanging off of the Cisco switch with the HP core still handling the routing, and that all works fine.\n I created a test VLAN on each switch and added it to the trunk on both ends, with the intention of testing the SVI on the Cisco switch and only L2 on the HP side. I don't know if it's coincidence that this is happening with the test VLAN, but I can't get the test VLAN to pass any traffic across the trunk. Devices connected to the Cisco switch can talk to the SVI, but anything on the other side of the trunk can't connect. I've done variations of testing and essentially, any devices on that test VLAN can talk to each other unless they are physically located on the other side of the trunk. I've moved the SVI to the HP side and anything on HP side is now able to talk to the SVI and anything on Cisco can no longer talk to it.\n If I run a packet capture on a device from either side, it sends ARPs and gets no replies, furthering my suspicion that this is just a L2 trunk issue.\n I suspect there is some sort of bug with this VLAN not getting passed because I added it later than other VLANs. I plan to shut and no shut the port on the Cisco switch during a window. I have encountered something similar when using VTP in the past.\n Just wondering if I'm missing something - this seems fairly basic so I'm astounded it's causing such an issue.\n EDIT: No VTP in use. The Cisco switch is a pair of stacked 9500s, and the trunk port is cross-chassis etherchannel. \n    submitted by    /u/save_earth  \n [link]   [comments]",

Eventually, the new appliance would be doing all the work. At that point, remove the old appliance and plug the new one directly into the ISP's modem. \n Is there a more common way to work through this scenario? Are there any gotchas?

          "description": "Hello. Would love thoughts/opinions on the best devices or type of devices or service. I have recently started at a small but growing enterprise. Company has 4 locations in the US and 3 in Asia. 3 locations have 200-300 users each and the rest are tiny. One of the larger sites hosts a single public facing application, accessed by our partners, nothing else is hosted publicly in the enterprise services (with the exception of client VPN). The rest have users mostly accessing Office 365, other SaaS applications and a smattering of internal applications. So far the long term goals of the company are:\n  \nTo ideally consolidate all sites on a single platform - not a hard requirement if something else makes sense but right now it's a hodge podge and current gear is up for renewal and/or end of life. Everything is basic firewalls right now, no NGFW/UTM/SWG etc.\n To implement a greater degree of filtering/inspection/prevention/reporting and to ultimately integrate with an EDR/XDR platform for better visibility.\n To ideally eliminate our MPLS in favor of an SD-WAN, with redundant ISP's in each location\n To move all server workloads, including the single public facing app, to public cloud\n  \nThe security vendor who my boss (CIO) has a relationship with is pushing him to buy their EDR/XDR platform along with their UTM's in every location. This is running a pretty high price tag and causing him to think about whether he can afford two for every location to have redundancy/fail over. I have a good networking foundation but my background is more on the server and storage side. At this point I am thinking that these UTM's at each location may be overkill for users surfing the internet. I am thinking there might be better/more cost effective alternatives. Or whether a hosted solution like zScaler or a competitor would be more cost effective. Ideally whatever solution we choose should have some way to integrate with an XDR platform.\n WWYD?\n thanks\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/moneydontjiggle4sure  \n [link]   [comments]",

It acts like a firewall issue, but I've tried many things that make me believe it's more of a fundamental limitation of QEMU/Libvirt/virbr0.\n I've have created several tunnels with Strongswan, but this roadblock has me stumped.\n Has anyone successfully created an IPSEC tunnel with KVM host using strongswan and the default virbr0 network? I'd like to have my VMs reachable over the IPSEC tunnel and also allow the VMs to reach my local LAN.\n I can reach the VMs without issue, but I can't connect from the VM to my local LAN. I noticed the issue when trying to connect two KVM hypervisors over the internet with Strongswan IPSEC. I've been running Strongswan to connect to my VMs in the cloud for over a year, but never realized the tunnel really doesn't work in the other direction (other than ping/ICMP works).\n The basic oddity is like this: I can ping a remote LAN host over the tunnel, but if I run traceroute, it tries to go to the public interface first, which leads me to believe it's a limitation of virbr0.\n If anyone would like to help, here are my iptables on the kvm host.\n Local LAN = 192.168.7.0.24\n Remote virbr0/KVM LAN = 192.168.222.0/24\n Here's the strongswan config.\n I think the workaround is to create a tunnel using Wireguard, but I hate being defeated and would really like to learn what I'm doing wrong or not understanding.\n Thanks in advance to anyone willing to contribute.\n    submitted by    /u/voltswagner  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sorry if this doesn't fit here.\n The issue I've been having, is that from a oracle cloud ampere server (with a 4 Gbps link) located about 1200 km away, with 34 ms of latency, I cannot seem to get more than about 100 Mbps to my local connection. \n I have tested it using iperf3, and even if I tinker with the settings to adjust threads it will not get any more than 100 Mbps. I have changed the mtu on both machines, changed the max tcp window size, and tried to change the hardware settings for nics on both of the machines. When I run a udp iperf3 test, I can reach the maximum speed my connection allows (1 Gbps).\n The reason why I believe more bandwidth should be possible is that when I use a wireguard vpn, I can reach tcp speeds through that connection to the server, above 600 mbps. Also, a speedtest from the server to a local speedtest server is about 1500 Mbps, and my connection to that same speedtest is at 1000 Mbps.\n I am not sure if this is just bad routing, or bandwidth delay product.

I am seeing in a Wireshark capture multiple other connections going through the same edge FWs are negotiating at TLS v1.2 and are successful. But only this one is negotiating by default as TLS v1.0 by the client and then getting a reset (since we reject v1.0 and 1.1). I have tried forcing TLS v1.2 at the browser level on the client and it still negotiates at v1.0.\n The only thing I haven't tried (since I don't have admin access to the VDI machines) is doing the windows OS-level registry change for removing TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1\n Any suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/Xibbas  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I'm looking to learn more about colocation and networking in the data center environment. Essentially, I have a few servers that I want to put into a rack in a data center but I'm tossed up on what direction I should start with.\n The first topic is the choice of networking equipment. The data center provides a 1 Gbps SFP connection. Now, I could plug that directly into a switch and have a server in the rack that handles DHCP, but are there any good cheap switches that have a DHCP server built in that also allows for easy remote management? \n The first setup I was looking at using was a Ubiquiti Dream Machine SE and a Ubiquti Pro switch. I would plug the SFP from the data center into the Dream Machine, then another SFP from the Dream Machine into the Pro Switch. Ubiquiti was a choice due to the familiarity of knowing how to manage the settings on both devices.\n The second setup was looking into Cisco Meraki devices, however, I'm not familiar with Cisco's product lineup. I do have my CompTIA A+ and Network+, so I am somewhat familiar with using the CLI, but the program I was in only had us focus on managing Cisco devices on a LAN through the CLI only. I was scrolling through threads on WHT and several times Cisco Meraki devices came up. Does anyone know if Cisco Meraki devices have a built in DHCP server? If not, then I would still need to have a DHCP server setup in the rack.\n Also, does anyone have any recommendations on material that I can use to help better understand networking concepts and practices in the data center regarding how to setup and manage BGP, how to assign IPv4 subnets to specific devices, or personal advice with first time colocation experiences?\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/fallen0523  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not a networking person, more of a SysAdmin, so I admittedly don't know a ton about networking equipment.\n During the cutover, one of the corporate IT network guys said there were a bunch of CRC errors on one piece of network equipment or another, and that this was causing really bad slowness. We were then instructed to replace any fiber cables shorter than 2 meters with longer ones. We had a number of 1M cables in place. Apparently (I didn't see for myself) the errors went away after this was done.

Just recently got a new job, doing some higher level infrastructure for a company of 1600 people and 60 locations, with an IT team of 4 (me being the networking guy). I’m just starting to really grasp tunnels, VLANs and trunking concepts in a large company. I’m currently doing network discovery for these locations as they dropped their MSP last month. I worked for a msp previously but we generally supported smaller offices with pretty basic networks without switches, subnets, and VLANs. They use several VLANs across the network at my new job. They’re using fortigates and dell switches primarily. I’m trying to familiar myself with these concepts to help understand the network more.\n Now looking at the static routes on the fortigate firewalls I can see and understand how VLANs and different subnets are communicating. My question is, do you need to setup static routes on a switch with VLANs as well? I’m thinking they would have similar static routes, explaining what IP schemes can communicate over a L3 switch? Or am I overthinking this?\n Thanks for any advice! We’re a small team and sometimes I feel like I have nobody to lean on for questions like this.\n    submitted by    /u/Tatu2  \n [link]   [comments]",

This switch has dhcp helper information for each vlan\n Now, the oddities:\n -I can't find any other dhcp server on our network of any kind, in any of the vlans\n -Only certain wired vlans are affected; the data vlans for end user PC's. Our wireless, phone, security camera, clock and management vlans are unaffected.\n -We don't exhaust the pool; we will get a random number of bad address entries, usually about a third of the amount of wired desktop PC's\n -I have set the DHCP lease time to 6 hours, which results in much fewer bad address entries. If I bump it up to 2-3 days or more, I will have double or triple the amount of entries.\n ​\n I'm suspecting it might be some of our Dell desktops (optiplex 3060, Win 10 and 11 Enterprise for clients) that is the issue; in the 5 vlans affected, all of the desktops are the same model Dell.

Also sorry for the wall of text. There will be a TL;DR at the end, but I hope the context is important. \n On Monday my business had some sort of power event that caused our firewall, main switch (hp-2510-48), phone system and one of our active directory/dns servers to power cycle before coming back online. After that in a seemingly random pattern, various end point devices can no longer connect to the network, and for those devices that can, the network latency is through the roof. Before, on average packet loss would be maybe 1/100 if we were looking, now it is 40-60% packet loss. \n Our initial investigation showed that plugging directly into …",

          "description": "Hi r/networking, \n I'm relatively new to networking and have a weird circumstance that I'm not sure how to tackle. \n I connect manufacturing equipment to our client's WAN on a regular basis. Our manufacturing equipement has an internal LAN with the IP scheme, 192.168.100.XXX, and I use a router to NAT to static IPs on our client's network that they provide. \n It's usually smooth sailing, I configure the router to the dedicated IPs the client provides and we're good to go. \n My trouble is my client's WAN is 192.168.100.XXX as well. So NATing would be pointless and I cannot reserve all of IPs of my machine on their network. \n Would there be a good way to not create conflict? My initial thought is to use a VLAN so my equipment's LAN sees the VLAN and their WAN sees the VLAN and neither ever sees each other, I don't actually know if this is possible or the best course of action. Any guidance is much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/njbruggeman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been trying to spoof the #1 and 2 IPs. So that the messages goes from #1 to (ME #4) then to the #2 Multi then #4.\n It doesn't really matter the order as long as I can see a loss, delay effect on either end of the network.\n ​\n  \nWhat I need:\n  \nI need a way to intercept and control the flow of these packets. I need to represent a loss of packets, and delay the time which the packets send at.\n ​\n  \nThings I have tried:\n  \nI have been using Ettercap and TC Qdisc to try and make this work. I can receive the packets with Ettercap, but when I try and use TC Qdisc it doesn't have any effect.\n I originally tested just going from IP1 to IP2 and used Ettercap to spoof these ips. I then used TC Qdisc to control the loss packets, delay, duplicate, and corruption of these packets and it Does work.\n ​\n In my original test without multicast you would see this on wireshark:\n 192.168.1.1 >> 192.168.1.15\n 192.168.1.15 >> 192.168.1.1\n ​\n With multicast you would see this on wireshark:\n 192.168.1.1 >> 235.1.200.1\n 192.168.1.15 >> 235.1.200.1\n I tired getting between the host and multi and tried applying the effects there but no luck. \n 192.168.1.15 >> (ME TC QDISC HOST) >> 235.1.200.1\n ​\n  \nQuestion to you:\n  \nWhat are my options here.

I'm currently doing discovery on this building, but I have no GUI/Web interface to log into for two of the three stacks.\n The MDF has no issues. I'm able to log into that via IP address no problem.\n I'm having issues getting into the other IDF stacks. I'm able to putty into them using SSH no problem. Credentials take which is a great sign.

          "description": "I seem to be getting conflicting information on how the IPsec protocol itself handles multiple subnets in a tunnel. I know different vendors have slightly different approaches to this, but I'm more concerned with what's actually possible in the protocol. I've heard the following so far:\n  \nMultiple subnets are agreed upon in phase 2, all in a single tunnel.\n Multiple phase 2 \"tunnels\" are created, one for each subnet pair.\n You can't do more than one subnet pair in the IPsec protocol. Therefore, multiple phase 1 tunnels are created, one for each subnet pair.\n  \nI think the 2nd answer is correct, but I can't seem to find any detailed information from an authority on it without diving deep into the RFC's.\n FWIW, I know it's possible to just make a big 0.0.0.0/0 tunnel and deal with the routing myself, but I'm trying to help a vendor troubleshoot their own stuff on a failover tunnel between us and them. The status on my side shows that in a failover event, only one of the subnet pairs is re-created.\n Edit: I'm now leaning towards the 1st answer because of the below link. It seems that you can have multiple traffic selectors. Some vendors just \"show\" this information as multiple phase 2 tunnels? But their terminology isn't necessarily accurate, and everything was only negotiated once in phase 2?\n https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/vpns/site-to-site-vpn-concepts/ikev2/traffic-selectors\n    submitted by    /u/j0mbie  \n [link]   [comments]",

Their old one was basically an allow all rule that configures the firewall like a router. I've told them multiple times this is not acceptable. \n Long story short I configured the firewall for them, but it did cause some things to break. (I don't actually work in their environment so its hard for me to know everything that goes on) \n Their environment is somewhat complex as they have multiple vpns belonging to clients. Also obviously clients don't give out all the security details of their programs so its been tough sledding to this point.\n My question is is what would you do if you were in my shoes? Is it not possible to block a lot of ports due to the size of the company? I've only worked at smaller companies so blocking multiple ports has never been an issue.\n I've read about doing network scans for 24 hours and then analyzing this data.

As a startup, we are essentially all \"floating\" right now --- we don't have a dedicated office with a dedicated network range, or any sort of on-premise presence.\n But, we need a way to access EC2, RDS, etc. without public IP addresses (and preferably without a publicly exposed bastion/jumpbox to get there). We don't have anything massively critical, and we will grow, so by the time we do, we can revisit this to really flesh out a sturdy solution. But right now I just need some basic items I can go through to ensure only our people can access our AWS resources.\n For VPN options that aren't site-to-site, \"Client VPN\" seems like an option: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/introducing-aws-client-vpn-to-securely-access-aws-and-on-premises-resources/\n If someone can just tell me if I'm warm or cold on this, and point me in the direction of the necessary service/tool that I need, that would be great.

The error is the same regardless of if I use any other iosxr method like for banners or logging which is why I tried switching to iosxr_command to rule out any weirdness but it's still there and only when pushing to the NCS540.\n I'm using network_cli for the connection and iosxr for the network_os in the group_vars vars file for this platform, same as the ASR.\n ​\n Any ideas?

The ISPs have 2 /30s and we are advertises out a /24. Does it make sense to have the switches handle the BGP or is it more common practice to have a device dedicated to that and the switches handle things like vxlan/spine leaf topology. \n \nHow do firewalls get implemented?

We have a Direct Connect connection from both of our DC's to AWS.\n ~2,800 of these sites use LTE and are on a private APN, they route to our 2 datacenters via MPLS circuits from our Telco. The speed at these sites averages between 15-20Mps.\n The remaining 700 or so sites use Internet, and route to our 2 datacenters via a pair of Internet circuits from different vendors. The speed at these sites is anywhere from 3Mbps (Satellite) up to 100+Mbps (Cable)\n Now to my question, I want to make sure our MPLS and Internet circuits (and AWS Direct Connect circuits) are scaled accordingly to support all of these downloads in this window. We want to make sure the downloads happen fairly quick (say less than say 10 minutes per device).\n Does anyone know of an online calulator that would help me do the math?\n I definitely plan on contacting our Telco to get their input, but I want to have some numbers (at least rough numbers) before engaging them to make sure they're not making shit up.\n As you can imagine this is a very large and very important implementation (we're on year 3 of the project) for my company and I want my portion (the network) to go as smoothly as possible.\n Any input would be muchly appreciated!\n ​\n MtM\n    submitted by    /u/mcdeath_the_mad  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "About a month ago, I cut over from a sonicwall to a watchguard firewall for a customer. One of the interfaces is an uplink to a meraki router. Apparently the sonicwall had DHCP configured for this interface but I didn’t catch that when configuring the new firewall. So the cutover happens and all appears to be working fine in the environment. Until today. The customer lost power last night and thats when the meraki router was no longer reachable. I spent an hour on the phone with the vendor who manages the meraki troubleshooting what could be the issue. I was out of ideas until they mentioned that they are configured for DHCP and that’s when I realized I never set up a DHCP sever for the interface (because when do routers use DHCP? Is this standard practice or something now?) Anyways, I configured a small address pool and the router came back online. I’m just surprised that the router maintained its lease from the previous firewall for as long as it did. At least I’m assuming that’s how it was still able to function.

They currently have a:\n Corporate Network (which I would like the VPN to be able to access) (10.*.*.*)\n VPN IP Range (172.1.*.*)\n Seperate Gateway VLAN (172.2.*.*) for servers they can access - these servers have an IP in both corporate and seperate VLAN, with gateway only entered on the seperate VLAN. This VLAN also has its own DNS which is what VPN clients are currently pointed to and provides the gateway VLAN ip address for these servers\n Issue is that people feel restricted, cant access file shares as if they were in work etc., have to remote on to an RDP server and productivity is suffering. My thoughts are that if the VPN is secure and has MFA in place, they can be considered secure enough to access all (or rather most - some is still locked behind other VLANs) corporate resources and work exactly as if they were in the office.\n So, to the issue - \n  \nI have put a rule in place on the firewall to allow fully authenticated users access to the corporate VLAN.\n \nI have updated the DNS on my computer to the corporate DNS. With this in place DNS works and I can ping ALL servers on the corporate VLAN except those with an IP address in both networks.\n \nPinging the other servers on their Gateway IP address works\n DNS gets the correct IP but I cant ping these on the corporate IP range.\n \n I suspect this is a routing and / or firewall issue but any pointers on where I should be looking would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Automatic-Ad7994  \n [link]   [comments]",

My test is downloading 46GB of data spread out over about 40k files, done by about 4k instances of the downloader process (this is done in a build system, so each instance of the downloader is run/cached separately,). This works out to an average of 10 files downloaded per httpclient instance and an.average of 1MB per file.\n Everything works fine until minute 4, when suddenly my download speed goes to 0. I have a timeout of 1 minute on the process and 5 attempts are made to download each file. About 2 minutes after the stalled downloads, it starts back up again. This is after the first two attempts timed out. The server logs show that it didn't even seem to receive the request that was being asked of it, and when it did receive a request, the server claims it handled it quickly.\n So far to troubleshoote I have tried to increase the dynamic port range, and limit the number of requests being sent at once to 75. Still this happens pretty deterministically around the 3-5 minute mark.\n Is there something I can check and try to figure out why it is stalling?

I have a big goal to eventually set up a mechanism to redirect past due clients to a \"Hey, pay your bill\" web page.\n Originally, I was trying to make this a function of DHCP with classes for user MACs that are active or suspended. Active clients will be given an IP on a subnet that is allowed out via NAT permit policy, wheras suspended MACs would be placed on a subnet not allowed out to the internet and has all DNS queries pointing to the IP of my web server (via bind9 views one using normal DNS forwarding and the other pointing to a local dnsmasq instance) with rewrite rules to my \"pay your bill\" page.\n This ALMOST worked, but when you have multiple IPs on one VLAN, one IP must be the primary IP and that put a halt to anything working. This was because the relay agent will always use the primary IP for the relay agent IP to determine which pool to grant an IP from. I can get a device from active to suspended if the suspended IP is the default, but it will not go back since the relay agent IP will always be the primary IP on the VLAN.\n This led me to consider RADIUS, since you can use Framed-IP-Address to reassign an IP.\n I have a working baseline FreeRADIUS server set up that accepts usernames, passwords and secrets and correctly responds. It is backed by MySQL. I can figure out mac-auth and the rest but I need to know how to make the HAPs authenticate themselves once they get on the network.\n The imagined flow would be DHCP on the primary (suspended) subnet. Radius processes if the MAC is active or not. If it is not it will stay on the suspended subnet. If the MAC is active RADIUS will provide an IP on the secondary (active) subnet.\n Is there a way to make what I am aiming for work?\n    submitted by    /u/SciensSciencia  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems it was an after thought as there has to be a local XML on every endpoint in order for the first connection to be made (after the first connection, the endpoint pulls the XML from the firewall)\n We don't think we can do this because of the mobile IoT devices that our company VPNs with. We also have some site to sites that are causing us to make VTIs and our company just keeps growing it seems and the firewalls are getting more complex with that.

Can the device behave as a standard client on the B interface (including receiving a DHCP address) but still allow AWS traffic to access devices on the network without being the default gateway for that network?

So far passing files from one to another is done using usb drives. I was thinking of connecting the PC with the internet to one of the PCs in the offline network and use a simple ftp server using Python scripts to automate this process. \n Now the question is, will that beat the purpose of the \"offline\" lan network security? Is there any standard way of keeping the Internet and the lan network fully seperate, like transfer the files ONLY through the python script and keep the lan network invisible from the Internet.

          "description": "I'm relatively certain I know the answer on this one, but wanted to get some outside confirmation - a type 2 route redistribution into OSPF will have a flat metric throughout the OSPF topology (1 if redistributing from BGP, 20 if redistributing from anything else, at least for Cisco's implementation). \n In contrast, for type 1 routes, the router doing the redistribution into OSPF doesn't try to add any cost based on the protocol it's being redistributed from. Say router XYZ is redistributing a static route to 5.5.5.0/24 as a type 1 route. Would it be correct to say that other OSPF routers in the topology calculate the metric for 5.5.5.0/24 based on their cost to reach router XYZ, and that router XYZ's perceived metric to reach 5.5.5.0/24 doesn't matter (static routes seem to have a \"metric\" in show ip route of 0 anyway)? If you had your reference bandwidth set to 10g, it wouldn't matter if the static route to 5.5.5.0/24 had a next-hop address associated with an interface running at 10g, 1g, or 100m; the OSPF topology is only considering the cost to reach router XYZ, and router XYZ won't try to artificially inflate the OSPF cost if the bandwidth on that interface changes.\n    submitted by    /u/AlmavivaConte  \n [link]   [comments]",

I get the security aspect and how it does more to authenticate users and devices than just saying \"Oh you're on the domain? You're good.\" However, it seems to be purely security. I don't see how it actually connects you to the network?

Topology is here: https://ibb.co/myN4xXn\n I did not design this network, I inherited it. My knowledge of BGP is shallow but I used it successfully in many simple networks.\n Site 2 uses Site 1's ExpressRoute to reach Azure when MPLS and Site 1's ExpressRoute are available. When not site 2 uses direct site to site VPN tunnel to reach Azure. Failover and failback work correctly when MPLS fails, but I am running into issues when ExpressRoute fails. When ExpressRoute fails Site 1 still advertises routes to Site 2 because it learns them through Site 1's site to site VPN. I don't want that.\n Site 2 uses weight to prioritize \"MPLS\" over Site to Site VPN to Azure. In Azure I am pre-pending AS to make one path less desirable.\n What I simply want to do is prevent Site 1 from advertising Azure routes to site 2 when they are learned through Site to Site VPN, but for some reason I can't wrap my head on how to do that. I know I need to use a route-maps to do it, but how to configure the route map and where to apply it is the question.\n Conceptually I think I need to first tag/identify routes when they are learned through site to site VPN Azure BGP neighbor, and then I need to deny those routes from being advertised to site 2.\n Right now I am using same route-map on site 1 for both Azure BGP neighbors. I think I will need to split that and use different route-map for each neighbor. \n It seems that I can use \"community\", \"origin\", \"tag\", and \"route-tag\" to make routes from one neighbor different than others.\n On premise equipment are FortiGate firewalls and ideally I like to make all changes on them. I want to avoid, if possible, to make changes in Azure.\n    submitted by    /u/interweb_gangsta  \n [link]   [comments]",

Getting old laptops or old pc’s running in attics would work but I’m looking for something small like a raspberry that I can plug into a switch in an attic get my stats and dump them into g drive.

I'm thinking about 'layering' functions like e.g. a geographical topology where I might open up a location, where I might choose between e.g. physical, L2 or L3 topologies pr. location, etc. A cascading system, if you will, where only the wished for information is displayed at a time.\n Hope the question makes sense!\n    submitted by    /u/TerjiD  \n [link]   [comments]",

So there is no way for me to re-route traffic to reach the new solution.\n All of the clients/servers on the webhosting side have their gateways pointed to the current interfaces on our web hosting ASA's (not on a BD in ACI). So these gateways would need to point to the new solution to. The new solution will have the same interfaces, ip's in the same networks etc... but will be different ip's. \n I need to find a way to avoid a big bang approach of just flicking over the all the servers gateways to the new firewalls with the migrated rule sets on and hoping for the best.

We are setting up a separate location using Comcast P2P. All the things at this location would need to talk to servers on a mix of VLANS. Eventually, we want to route everything but one of my questions is does it have to be done all at once? Our initial thought is to start with this location and then move on to everything else. \n Doing some research, I believe the most future-proof routing protocol would be OSPFv2 (correct me if I'm wrong). Is it going to be a huge headache to connect a 10.0.0.0 to a 192.168.0.0 network? Currently, everything is on 192.168. The biggest reason we want to move to layer 3 is that we have a data center connected to the main location via 2 dark fibers and 1 P2P fiber. Currently, they are separated from each other and the P2P is on a disabled port only to be enabled when the other 2 are down. The 2 dark fibers are redundant but we want to connect that 3rd one to the other 2 dark fibers. We either can't do that or can't figure out how to do that because the 2 dark fibers are 10g and the P2P is 1g.\n Is it feasible to move to layer 3? We have roughly 350 PCs, 100 printers, ~400 phones, 35 switches, and ~100 servers and I'm sure I'm missing more.

What I mean by interactive is, that you can hover over a country or location and see the most important information as well as being able to \"drill down\" by double clicking it.\n I know it is a lot, but and I tried several solutions over the years and found not a single one to create such a \"diagram\"\n - Visio - Great for detailed Branch Network documentations, but not intereactive\n - Miro - Interactive and easy to use for \"quick and dirty\" schematics\n - draw.io - same as Miro\n - powerpoint - Interactive but not really meant for network diagrams\n - lucidcharts - same as visio\n - NetBrain - expensive, kinda hard to master and not \"easy to use\"\n - Any other SDN tool (solarwinds, n-map, ...) same as netbrain\n - even tried some tools for scientific network maps - They basically do what I need but just to a certain degree\n - .....\n As you might notice I've tried a lot and might even have missed some things i tested in the past.\n Maybe one of you big brains out there has something in mind or created something similar in the past.\n I am looking forward for any tips, hints and suggestions :)\n    submitted by    /u/HighlightEven1406  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do I need a tac case for cisco to apply the 3 license I need (security k9 and app-k9) or is there a command I can enter to get these registered on my own?\n If I do a sho ver I show it does have Foudationsuitek9, securityk9\n    submitted by    /u/Accomplished_Bed7023  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a routed network, but these devices must have transparent layer 2 connectivity between them?\n If I have a Cisco 3850, Cisco 9300, and a Cisco 3650 in a triangle of routing, can I use a technology, such as VXLAN to span a VLAN across these? Do these platforms support this?\n What if I have a more complex network? Does each switch in the routing path need to be VXLAN supporting, or only the ingress/egress switches?\n Is there a performance consideration doing this, or should the switches be able to handle this traffic at or near line-speed?\n Is there a better way? I have no experience on VXLAN, outside of reading about it.\n ​\n There are two use-cases for this. One is for the above diagram, where I have a special system that must have layer two connectivity. Furthermore, if this works, there will be more than two endpoints, and I would need to provide a common Layer 2 spanning several locations. The bandwidth requirements are low. <10Mbps\n The second use case is to create a form of hyper segmentation, for security. I'd like to be able to span several VLANs out to certain sites for IOT, guest access, surveillance cameras, etc. All running back to a central firewall, or series of ACLs would control access between the segments.

The switch currently says it is delivering 3-4W PoE to all cameras, but the port lights only turn on for 1-2. In all cases, neither IP or link-layer pings can reach them.\n The switch is also delivering PoE to two Wifi APs and an unmanaged PoE-in 5-port switch. These three things have continued to function fine, with the Wifi APs being online even longer than the cameras.\n Also, the cables have been tested and verified. They are shielded CAT6 with solid 23 AWG copper wire. Should hold up just fine.\n Back to the cameras, I can't seem to get the online. There are 4 different models, all from Reolink, and only the oldest one (out of support) lights up a network port. I've also tried them on a ProCurve 2520-8 (J9137A), and it's the nearly the same problem, except that one old camera gets CRC/alignment errors showing up in the switch logs for it's port. Doesn't matter which port I connect it to.\n The only explanation I can think of, and it doesn't make complete sense to me, is that somehow a power outage bricked the PoE Reolink cameras, but not the other PoE devices, and not the PoE switch itself.

I have successfully set up OPNSense, a Brocade 6450, and a Ruckus r710 running the latest Unleashed firmware. My main SSID is set up on the AP and is running perfectly fine. My issue is when I got to setup a second SSID for IoT on my r710. \n Similar to PFSense, I have configured my router with a Vlan, different subnet of 10.0.10.0/24, DHCP server, etc.... The vlan is tagged as 10 on OPNSense. I have done the same on the R710.... I created a guest network, under WLAN set the VLAN to 10. \n Then on the brocade, I created a vlan and set the port 48 to dual mode so that the tagged vlan 10 and the untagged traffic should be able to flow, but that hasn't worked. I even tried to assign the subnet IP to the tagged vlan 10 with no change. \n The only thing that has worked so far somewhat is when I set the Vlan tag to 1 in the Guest SSID on the ruckus, but that similar then routes traffic through the untagged rule on the switch which does not achieve the true separation I want for my Vlan. \n What am I missing here? Any help or direction would be helpful! I have been reading documentation for several hours now, but I am no where closer to solving my problem. Am I missing something simple or am I WAY off base on my understanding of how things needs to flow? Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/Aurum115  \n [link]   [comments]",

My question is when radio waves are sent from the antenna of my wireless device to the router, how is the binary interpreted in the right order or reconstructed into the right order?\n My understanding is that the radio waves can reach the router out of order due to multi propagation where radio waves can take different paths of different lengths due to reflecting off of objects (which are potentially moving). \n Also, can someone confirm my understanding is right that only a single device communicates with an access point at a time because of CDMA/CA. This allows the access point to know which device is sending it signals right? I realize in the newer 802.11 ax, it can split a channel into subsections and interpret signals from multiple devices at the same time so does it need CDMA/CA?\n Thanks for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/infinity123248  \n [link]   [comments]",

The APs and switches won’t arrive for long and I need to fix internet ASAP. It’s super bad. Some areas aren’t covered at all. Even cable internet keeps disconnecting. \n Fortigate is in stock and available. I can start requisitioning them and fixing office network. \n I do not have ANY experience with Forti and I do not want to make a rushed decision because of time constraints. \n Can any of you tell me what your experience with Fortigate has been?

I've seen a few posts suggesting that Nexus 9K devices should be used to replace the 6509's, there is also a colleague who suggests the same. I was thinking today (when working on a couple of Nexus devices), that they are a bit overkill just for a site? Especially when most of our access switches are still 3560 era.\n ​\n I really do not have much Nexus experience, so I am genuinely interested in what people think and the advantages/disadvantages of them. \n A colleague and I were speaking today that replacing a C6509 at a site with 2 x Nexus switches in a VPC seems overkill. Especially when there are a maximum of 15 access switches (this is our largest site, some only have 5/6 access switches). We both agreed that a 2/3 stacked 48 port C9300's or equivalent could be a good replacement on the 6509's going forward. They have 10G access and uplink ports and the pair of us agreed that they're easier to set up in terms of HSRP (stacking them will do it). We are also curious to understand the benefits of VPC over standard port-channeling.\n ​\n Sorry for my ignorance on this one, but as I mentioned my Nexus knowledge is poor!\n ​\n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Pleasekin  \n [link]   [comments]",
