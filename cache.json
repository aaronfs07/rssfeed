I'm in my 40's now and just met someone and don't want this on-call stuff now. I have multiple area that I'm interested in, my latest Cisco cert being the DevNet Associate as I'm increasingly becoming more and more interested in a Python orientated job. However, I'm more geared towards using it for automation and DevOps kind of stuff, though I am also learning Django for a possible business idea, and I have an real interest in ML.\n Anyway, back to my original thought, my interest in networking has seriously waned over the last few years and was looking at cloud. I read that AWS is king of cloud platforms, however I also notice that here in the UK, I hardly ever see job requiring AWS, the vast, vast majority want Azure.\n Now I know as far as the customer is concerned, the difference between them at first glance is mostly aesthetic; different interface etc.\n Given that I really like working with Python, rather than Powershell, what would be a better option between AWS and Azure?\n    submitted by    /u/MrFanciful  \n [link]   [comments]",

Using the database function I can create unique SKU labels with OEM automative part numbers, SKU barcodes and qr codes to URLs from an excel spreadsheet.\n I can also add numerical counters to these functions. Making them sequential off the excel cell data which represents each donor vehicles individual ID number.\n What I would love is to add a product image to the label which is also the first image on the eBay listing.\n I can't seem to embed any images into the excel cell. All 3 label making softwares are reading the image from the database as text and displaying 'picture' instead of the image.\n I can manually add images to each label but it will take way too long.

The company swapped the motherboard in all the Chromebooks with another. To get the motherboard to sync with the Chromebook, they entered Dev Mode and switched the serial number to match the original Chromebook.\n When we got them back, it prompted us to re-enroll them, so we did. Now, the Chromebooks all have the same issue. When using wireless, it does not auto connect like it is supposed to. You can manually enter the CBNet Wi-Fi and password and use the Chromebook, but once you power off an on again, it doesn't auto-connect (although you can still click on the network and connect because the SSID and password are saved.\n We called the company, and they said that it is not an issue they've had, and they bought their motherboards from different manufacturers for the 3100 and 3100 2 in 1. We have tried an OS recovery, but we can't powerwash because we had it disabled in the Admin Console (it still appears to be disabled). We also can't powerwash through the console. It shows the last activity on the Chromebooks as months ago. When connected to the network with an ethernet to USB adapter, you can login to the Chromebook and use it.\n We have tried manually connecting to other Wi-Fi's, and that works the same as with CBNet. The only difference is that when connecting to the CBNet network, there is an exclamation point to the bottom right of the Wi-Fi symbol.\n ​\n Any help would be appreciated!!\n    submitted by    /u/StudentTechMV  \n [link]   [comments]",

So that means that I have to interview all over again, which I don't mind. The part that I do mind is having some cocky kid ask the most asininely questions to me during an interview about my skills or background. I'm not sure whether they are meaning to be asses to show their worth to their boss and use me as their example or if they genuinely do not know how to do an interview. For example, only a few years ago I had this guy ask me what I would do if a user reported they were having an issue while printing. Seriously??? A freaking printer problem?? That's Tier 1, at best, and I'm Tier 2/3 my entire career since about 1995 and this guy asks me about a printer issue and how I would resolve it?\n So, what's the most assinine thing you've been asked during an interview as part of your experience?\n    submitted by    /u/NormanRB  \n [link]   [comments]",

We were advised by Sage's business partner in my country to set up a cloud instance with 16 GB of RAM, 4CPUs and 120GB SSD storage which we did. However, we logged in four simultaneous users and it seemed to be a bit sluggish. Given that during normal business operations, we'll have more than 10 simultaneous users logged in, this didn't seem like a good fit. Now, the confusion is this, the business partner had asked for a lot of money to set the server up. They say that there is a way you set up the server so that it becomes faster, he even mentioned that he has a server with the same specs handling more than 18 simultaneous users logged and working seemlessly. The question is, what is this \"way\" they are talking about? From my understanding the steps of setting up a server are pretty standard, I mean, chose the package (In my case AWS Lightsail) and then launch it. Are there any tips and tricks I am missing?

I've recently inherited the setup here so trying to get all sorted and all up to 2019 / 2022.\n Our domain functional level is 2012 R2 as we still have 1 2012 R2 DC that's due to be replaced with 2022 in the coming months, but I've noticed our forest level is showing 2008 R2. I decommissioned a 2008 R2 DC yesterday, and increased the functional level to 2012 R2. Is that because of the 2008 R2 servers kicking about still or is it likely still updating in the background?\n    submitted by    /u/signal-tom  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a desktop guy at a small org, doing everything from help desk to server work. Intune management, laptop, phone setup, on off boarding, printer management, paper refilling, swipe card setup, desk relocations, visitor queries, water cooler repairs, the whole shebang.\n I have real problems with getting busy and forgetting what I was doing and I'm wondering how to manage this.\n I had a user ask me to do something, and between walking from one end of the office back to my desk and sitting down, I'd forgotten what it was was sitting down to do and proceeded to instead do the other two things I got asked about on the way. Sometimes I'll read an email and go to action it then forget what I was doing halfway through, or answer a question and then forget about the email completely. \n It's this kind of forgetfulness that keeps getting me in trouble with the boss. How do you guys manage this when you run into it? I have rules on my inbox to flag emails as they come in now, as well as a task planner in teams, but I still keep running into these issues whenever I get busy.\n I've mentioned it to my boss before, but short of moving to paid overtime to clear my to do list I'm not sure what I can do. I'm one of the lowest salaried staff at my org from what I understand, but I can't move jobs because I otherwise like my job and can't do things like that in my life (if someone had a gun to my head and told me to move jobs or stand up for myself I'd just take the bullet)\n Anyway input on how to not forget things would be great.\n    submitted by    /u/8ftmetalhead  \n [link]   [comments]",

However it does not seem to remove the current set of unapproved updates. I have also tried to run some script's found online but alas this has not worked either.\n Would really appreciate some help as I'm really struggling to make progress on this one.\n Thanks\n Sam\n    submitted by    /u/Galvex  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our anti-spam policy is, as of now, set to the weakest setting and unfortunately, we are not seeing any improvement by training the AI. There is no really help from Microsoft. The escalations we already made do not bring any solution. The want to sell us a high price support contract although we've evidence the spam detection respectively the AI is bad (much too agressive). We're in contact with another organisation they've been fighting with this behaviour since about 5 years. \n Fun fact also serious mails from MS or other organisation/companys using EOP, MDO and Exchange Online are classified as spam.\n Has anybody similar experience like we?\n And found a way to tweak it?\n    submitted by    /u/keysersoze-975  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the carelessness is deliberately filtering for victims already. \n I have seen some very high quality spear-phishing attempts recently, that don't have \"mistakes\" in them. They have email addresses that look very plausible - sometimes spoofed, sometimes belonging to the .co.uk for a .com or similar.\n Occasionally coming from a personal email that looks like it could be a legitimate member of staff. Etc. \n But elegantly crafted, personalised and a very plausible sort of request or warning. \n The only way to spot these is to be skeptical about all of them. Don't rely on lazy scammers to be obvious about it, because that makes you vulnerable to the ones that aren't.\n If you want an analogy, then lets go with foraging for mushrooms. There's a load of varieties of mushrooms that are edible and very tasty.

It's doable but not fun at all. \n Is it possible to \"trick\" the domain into avoiding the tombstone at powerup? Say for example, going into each machine at initial powerup before the OS is loaded and setting the BIOS clock back close to the last time the domain was live, and then moving the clock forward after all the machines have synced up?

I'm sure many of us work with one, or have worked with one. \n The person who intentionally sets things up in such a complicated way that only they know how to administer it, maybe to feel a sense of importance or job security? \n We have an admin who refuses to use a windows computer and does everything via Mac, even though our environment is 99% windows. We have a small team of media relations people who use Mac for graphic design, video editing, and a few apps that are specific to Mac. This is around 3 people. \n This same admin, when tasked with rebuilding a Windows 2012 file server, insists on using Linux/Samba because it \"will probably play nicer with the Macs\". This is 2023, I highly doubt a Mac can't connect to a Windows SMB share. At the same time, he also insists on running BIND DNS inside a FLAR container on Solaris, when he is the only one that knows Solaris - these boxes also haven't been patched in years and run insecure versions of BIND.\n What do you call these people?

The server was hosting six production VMs, and due to a single PSU failure and motherboard issue(My finding), it completely failed. The worst part was that the previous system administrator had not backed up the critical databases.\n As the new guy, I was tasked with recovering the databases, and I was totally freaked out. I tried to recover the databases, but the server was unable to POST the ESXi, which made things even more challenging. After some trial and error, I decided to unmount the server from the rack and take it to my desk. I disassembled the server, removed the RAM, cleaned it with a vacuum, and rested it for over 10 hours.\n To my surprise, the hypervisor loaded successfully, and I was able to dump the six database files from one VM. However, the server suddenly went down, and I was unable to shift the dumped files. I tried again, and after a few attempts, the server worked for two hours before crashing again.\n At this point, I knew I had to act fast. I backed up everything and restored the system the next day, which was a challenging task, but I managed to get it done.\n I'm curious to hear about your experiences with server failures and database recovery. What are some of the worst cases you've encountered? And how did you handle them? Let's share our stories and learn from each other.\n    submitted by    /u/prosaugat  \n [link]   [comments]",

Had to use these tools because the environments didnt allow to install any other ones. This was my first time doing a transfer of such a scale with such tight constraints on tools and managed to complete it in approx. 3 months. Given this information, I wanted to know what the wider market thinks of this. How much would you give this effort out of 10? Or on a scale of (1) I'd hire you for triple the pay (2) Ok.

The system is setup with C: as the OS and D: as has the Hyper-V files.\n Typically, a rebuild for this array takes about 12 hours. Right now, it's estimating 12 days! The odd thing is, the entire system has slowed to a crawl. Any IO on C: or D: brings the system to a crawl. Programs lock up for a few minutes.\n Looking at the event logs, and I'm getting a bunch of the following events:\n  \nEvent 9, Hyper-V-StorageVSP - An I/O request for device 'C:\\Virtual Hard Disks\\XXXX.vhdx' took 10675 milliseconds to complete. Operation code = READ16, Data transfer length = 4096, Status = SRB_STATUS_SUCCESS. We are getting this error for both C and D drives.\n \nEvent 129, percsas2i - Reset to device, \\Device\\RaidPort0, was issued.\n \n We also use VeeamOne and are getting disk latency alarms for both drives.\n I am able to export the VMs across the network to a different system without any issues.\n At this point, I'm thinking maybe a raid controller or backplane issue. Any thoughts? I'm super tried so pardon my if my post didn't make sense.\n Notes: Yes, I know the R720 is ancient.

I have another appointment with a doctor that is going to go through some things with me to give me a \"second opinion\" on my conditional diagnosis.\n A month ago when the post was first put out there I read it in full, comments and all, and almost everything that people were putting out there seemed to jive with how I am. \n I dive deep into MANY MANY things/hobbies I'm interested, I misplace things easily, I jump from topic to topic, or task to task at work, and many other things that jived with the post/comments.\n My therapist also explained that many folks who undergo many stressors during a young age, like I was brought up, don't usually get diagnosed with ADHD. Their brains bar for stress is much higher and it's usually chalked up to that. \n I want to thank /u/sobrique for bringing this topic up and leading me down an enlightening path. \n I have recently seen on reddit posts after the above post that ADHD is very heavily linked to alcoholism and I with alcoholism. I don't drink during the day( or even think about drinking alcohol), and only at night a little too much and things have become unmanageable with relationships in my life. I have been seeking help with alcoholism for quite some time, I had a long hiatus from alcohol and fell back in recently after some stressful situations. I am hoping that this diagnosis, with a coupled medication(dopamine levels normalizing, and not partaking), can help me get off of alcohol and get the old me back. \n I have blathered on too long and need to go to bed now.

In the last month or so, this has brought something new our way with a series of what I'm quite certain are DDoS attacks. Nothing that would crash Facebook, but HTTP requests for our landing and login pages at a rate of ~1000/second without follow-up for the page's resources. Attacks are happening maybe a few times a week.\n I've been building an IP blacklist from the points of origin, am rate-limiting these pages by IP, and have split login onto its own server, so that when these pages get flooded most of our users are not impacted. All of that has done a lot to mitigate the effects of these attacks.\n What's the long-term game, though? Should I be concerned that we're seeing regular attacks, or is this just a product of seeing more traffic? Are there other measures I should be taking? Can I be a better citizen of the internet by reporting points of origin to somewhere?\n Thank you so much for your thoughts on this!\n    submitted by    /u/base736  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So we have PingID for SSO and MFA and have our M365/Azure authenticate through it. Here recently we've had some key users get locked out of AD constantly. This is because the authentication requests go to our DC to authenticate each SSO authentication, and because it's a brute force attempt, it's constantly locking out those users. \n I reached out on multiple occasions to PingID and they dismissed it as \"non issue\" or pointed the finger back at us. I finally got some escalation and was taken semi-seriously at pointing out this issue (exploit??) and here was there recommendation: \"Turn off AD lockout\" What? So remove a security measure to open up an even bigger risk? Let them brute force the crap out of each user until they get the correct password, then move on to the next steps? Why would we give them that ability? We've asked Ping to provide logs of where the attacks are coming from, IP's, location, something. They refuse to give any. Their dashboard doesn't provide logs because they never (yet) have made it past the first authentication factor. It only logs on second factor.\n Ping recommends buying another product (Ping Federate) to solve this issue, but has not provided any details on how that fixes the issue. We also don't feel we should have to purchase more products from them to fix \"their\" issue.\n Here's where I'm stuck. Azure shows no logs. Purchased Azure AD P2 hoping that would help. No change in Azure AD logs. Nothing showing where the authentication attempts are coming from. Tried various geolocation and IP reputation blocks on Ping, nothing because it doesn't block until second factor. What else could be do to stop the AD Lockouts without \"turning off AD Lockout\" as Ping carelessly suggested?

I believe I have been trying to do the job of about 5 ppl. Initially I even stayed full nighters and work next day without sleep. There was so much demand and pretty much have been treated like garbage. There have been many crying alone days and near a complete mental breakdown. I found a new job and gave my notice and what I feared would happen is happening. They will try to bully me into a consulting deal. I gave them one and a half week notice as I had not clearance yet from new job. They’re saying I have a moral obligation to stay longer to train someone since I’m the only person that knows these systems for years. I told them I will write all documentation necessary. I know they prob asked their lawyer as a lot of legal terminology is used when talking with me so that tells me they’ve been asking their in house lawyer what are their options. They tried to promise matching salary and hiring more ppl but I don’t trust them and they’re bullies. I’m glad I didn’t tell them where I’m going as I’m starting to see their ugly character hidden thinking about ways to threaten me in one way or another. Idk how they do it as I know they’ve bullied others that have resigned into something similar. But I want nothing to do with them. I need to focus on my new job. They’re saying things will break and I leave them in a very bad position.\n Any advice is appreciated to how to handle this situation. I know once I finally say no to everything they will look for ways to threaten me or get back at me or get me in the hook w signing something that will make me liable.

I highly recommend buying AT&T from a company with better customer service. \n A lot of companies just want to kick the ticket back to you by always asking for more stuff.

I've already enrolled all of our Windows devices in Azure/Intune and wanting to replace Kaseya. I know there are many unattended remote control solutions that would replace what I primarily use Kaseya for, but one thing I can't seem to find without an RMM is something that gives live device inventory: what PC's are currently on, users that are logged in, IP address of the PC, last reboot time, last agent check in time, and hardware details. Azure/Intune give some but not all of this. Most importantly I'd like to know what computers are on and connected and if anyone is logged in. I'm sure you can run custom scripts with Powershell and/or Microsoft Graph, but looking for something on a web interface. Is this possible with any of Microsoft tooling, and if not, what other solutions would provide what I'm looking for?

Most of our central services is already hosted by an MSP, but not this (and they don't want to).\n So we have an alarm system to mobilize our workforce in an event. Central Server; calls a list of numbers; maybe do it again. I got this system handed over with following specs: old desktop pc; 2 LineCards for connecting to a PBX via ISDN.\n Now we came to a point, where we want to have geo-redundancy and multiple tenants. In the fist meeting we came to the conclusion it would be alright elevate the pc to a VM, connect to the PBX via VoIP (which I already planed). Create a second VM do the same, connect to a second PBX and use the build-in clustering mechanic from the software. Sounds easy enough with an second MSP which is selling the software.\n So my point is: In second thought I remembered there is a cloud solution for this software. Now I'm kinda torn between self-hosting or SaaS. SaaS, would solve my and my team lacking knowledge in PBX-tech and geo-redundancy (or at least outsource it). As the system is kinda critical, I'm questioning the reliabilty of the cloud, which would be better than right now, but if we self-host we can call the internal deskphones without external calling.\n TL;DR: would you move a critical alarmingsystem to the cloud or not?\n    submitted by    /u/GelleSkelle  \n [link]   [comments]",

Once email hits our internal mail servers if the recipients mailbox is in O365 the email is forwarded to O365 over a send connector. Outbound mail for on-prem users goes out through 3rd party filtering service. O365 senders mail leaves through EOP.\n I am reviewing the non-accepted domain report on the O365 Exchange admin home page and I see a large number of emails listed in this report. These emails originate from the Internet and are routed from on-prem to O365 mailboxes. I am assuming they are not being delivered but I have not heard anyone complaining yet. Unfortunately I don't have the ability to dig into the results from the report. So what I have been doing is taking the domains listed there and using message trace to track emails by the domain. I don't see anything getting blocked. Can someone explain what I am apparently missing here? Are the emails really being delivered but for some reason since it's coming from our on-prem servers they are marked as non-accepted domains?

The URL that Gophish needs to listen should be public but can't be directly set to 2.2.2.2 when creating a campaign it should be localhost(1.1.1.1). I've got an SMTP relay service setup with verified identities and can send emails successfully. The problem is that usually everything gets hosted on the internal VM(1.1.1.1) in my case or in articles is shown on EC2 instances with Gophish installed, and domain pointing to it. But in my case the internal VM is not open to the internet and connection must go through 2.2.2.2. My goal is when a link in the email is clicked to lead to my domain example.com?rid=516313 and to open the landing page I've configured, and when the link is clicked to somehow find its way to 1.1.1.1 through 2.2.2.2.

My jaw dropped when he said they are going the chiplet route like AMD since I was afraid they will do that.\n Pretty much all of our clients use Oracle Standard 2 on Intel hardware for our product. We can't use AMD because if licensing. Essentially if you have an AMD Epyc with four chiplets, you need FOUR CPU LICENSES. Yes, really. Which means you would need the Enterprise edition which costs more than I want to know (ranges of tens of thousands of Euros).\n Now that Intel does the same, there are multiple options.\n a) Oracle will change their licensing (highly unlikely) to allow chiplets\n b) It will not apply to the Intel implementation (it is a bit different to AMD)\n c) We start working immediately on moving our product from Oracle\n d) Our customers will need to just buy old, pre 2023 servers.

I absolutely hate using access because it is not in the cloud but it does everything I need as a single person, and in less than an hour I can go to database that will show me a dashboard of what I want to know and generate reports.\n I know there's so many cloud options right now but every time I try something new there's something that is not quite straight forward and takes more time to figure out and just leaning on my old trusty Microsoft Access skills. I wish I had time to learn as there are so many cool cloud tools these days, and sure if a customer is interested in a specific product I will learn everything about it and become an expert in it. In this case I'm falling back on access because I've already spent too much time dabbling in Microsoft Teams, messing around with building a small ticketing system within to organize tracking packages. When it comes to learning more for the sake of non-tangible endeavors it is often put on the back burner.\n And I'm not wasting time posting this because I can walk my dog and ponder at the same time.\n    submitted by    /u/No-Wonder-6956  \n [link]   [comments]",

The design decision overall makes sense, it’s just not optimal for some use cases. The end-result for forwarding to third-party systems, like Zendesk, is that messages flagged as phishing still get forwarded to the external system because the forward occurs before the content filtering by design. Some of these third-party systems have far less sophisticated content filtering that EOP.\n Short of implementing a legacy-style content filter, where you change your MX records, in front of our entire exchange environment, any ideas on how to forward messages after content filtering?

          "description": "In recent years, technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning have become increasingly important in practically every aspect of our lives. Based on these technologies, there are also promising identity and access control strategies. But what function do they truly play in identity and access management?\n The use of artificial intelligence to find anomalies in user behavior is one strategy being studied in this context. Algorithms examine user activity within a system and spot any unexpected behaviors that might point to a security problem. In this approach, possible assaults can be discovered and countered at an early stage.\n In the area of authentication, there are also interesting methods based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Systems that examine a user's voice or behavior to confirm their identification are one example of this. With no further user action required, high security authentication can be accomplished in this way.\n The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in identity and access management is, however, being questioned by certain critics. One explanation for this is the possibility of faults with these technology. Users may be mistakenly blocked or unauthorized users may obtain access to secured systems as a result of a flawed system.\n How do you feel?

I've had anything from the application simply not opening, to it disconnecting from exchange, and other spontaneous issues. Everything stays up to date and it seems to only affect our 3500's, not our Latitude 5000's. The only way solutions I've found are rebuilding the Outlook profile, M365 repairs, and if all else fails a user profile rebuild. \n I don't mind doing my job and fixing these issues, but it's getting to the point where I'm just genuinely having my time wasted with users having the same Outlook issues over and over again. Hell, I've even completely wiped and redeployed a machine and that same issue happened again.

A couple of days after installing KB502289, users complained about data shares not being accessible. We noticed that the ACLs on each server weren't listing domain members, and that led to figuring out that the secure channel/trust relationship was now broken on each of these servers.\n Tried multiple fixes including:\n  \nrolling back update KB502289\n Secure Channel repair\n domain unjoin/rejoin\n  \nNone worked, and we ended up just moving the data off of the servers (as we had planned to retire them later this year anyway) and re-creating the shares. We're still not 100% certain how this could have been remedied if we were forced to keep the servers in production.\n I'm fairly certain that this issue was caused in some part due to Netlogon protocol changes/hardening but I can't prove it, and I'm somewhat concerned about how this could end up affecting other servers in our enterprise further down the line. I know this Netlogon hardening is considered a KABOOM so I've been trying to mitigate against issues, but wasn't anticipating this one.\n    submitted by    /u/Jaymesned  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, as an IT apprentice this has been effecting me more and more, especially for my portfolio.\n For my portfolio I have to fill out a KSB table (Knowledge Skills and Behaviours) where I have met each topic, e.g. applying the appropriate skills/techniques for secure working. Every time I go to look at it I feel a little overwhelmed and not sure where to start due to this weakness. \n Moreover, when providing on site support, as I am first/second line support, it can be difficult for me knowing where things are. Although I know where users are as I have learned their names after being there a while, if someone says one of the clock in machines isn't working I have to get them to describe where rather than just saying the area name.\n I wasn't entirely sure where on reddit to ask this, so if there is a better place please advise me :) However, I thought this would be a good place as my issues are effecting my ability in my career and I am sure someone else has likely experienced this.\n    submitted by    /u/BethGayming  \n [link]   [comments]",

These are issues that seems to relate to their drivers and the interaction with the rest of the network/print server ecosystem. \n Our experience when contacting the different Copier/Printer suppliers is mostly rejections saying that the issue is with our systems - e.g. once we had a technician connect a laptop directly to the ethernet port on a copier, print a page and conclude that there was not a problem printing to their device. While I can understand the technician's point of view, in regards to his domain with technical support of the copier itself, I am guessing it is fairly few organizations who buy a copier for one person to connect directly to it via ethernet cable.\n Other times they will say we can only use one specific driver without further explanation, even though their own company supplies both Universal and PCL and PS variants.\n We try of course to be diligent in our testing and problem solving, but when we cannot find fault in our systems, we need somebody to turn to. It seems it is very hard to get the suppliers of Copiers/Printers to take what seems to be issues with their drivers and the interaction with other IT systems seriously?\n So I am asking for advice on how you handle issues with copiers, where you have tested different configurations in regards to network, server setup and drivers with no luck\n  \nDo you buy special support from the copier/printer manufacturers?\n Do you have a secret hotline?\n Any other tips?\n  \nThank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Dozy_Dolphin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently I have 2 domain controllers that mirror each other on the flat network. A handful of users will need to authenticate across all 3 zones.\n What should I do with the domain controller to keep it secure. Should I keep it in the user zone and place read-only DCs in the other zones? Should I keep it the servers zone and setup DCs in the 2 other zones with one-way trusts? Should I setup stand alone DCs in all 3 zones and create those user accounts accounts the 3 DCs? My paranoia is that if my one DC gets compromised then users can't log into the 3 zones. My ICS zone needs to be the most secure.\n    submitted by    /u/wifikey  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We have a few Windows Server VMs on-prem. All of them except for our DNS/DHCP server are not super critical. Even if our DNS/DHCP server was compromised or died, we have a back up of the configs that we could just throw on a new Windows server instance. Most other VMs mainly just serve as app servers for facilities, or jump boxes for ScreenConnect. We run Veeam backups, but they're not being off-sited. They could go down and people could still do their jobs, but we'd still have to rebuild things for them.\n If we were ever compromised, the org would not really be heavily affected, but we'd probably spend quite a bit of time setting new things back up. My question, is should we invest the money and time into making sure we have off-site backups if the information is not super critical? Or are things more critical than I really think?\n    submitted by    /u/mxbrpe  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are part of companys that are privaty held by one person. No compay helds share of other company, one person is phisical owner of all companys. Also owners wish is that our compay deals with all IT related problem.\n So the problem is, that people from this companys are freaquenty working in some other company ( in this group of companys) and bringing their PC's around, making a mess with licence tracking. It is not realistic, that when a person is tasked to work at other company for a period of time, his PC will be sold to this company and then (after he is finished) soled back to primary company again.\n So our idea is, that my company (IT) would own all the PC's and server, and leasing it to other companys. We can easly track where some PC is (majoraty of month), and invoiced the proper compay for monthy usage of this PC. But i cannot get the information if this kind of bussines model is legal from Microsoft Windows OS stand point? We would like to do the same with servers (Win Srv 2019 Datacenter for hosts and Standard for WMs).\n Can we buy PCs and laptops with OEM Win PRO licence and lease them to other companys?\n Thank you for pointing me in right direction, i will gladly provide additional information.

I think ultimately we'd like a single product for endpoint security, but that may not be possible. \n The most pressing issue is endpoint content filtering and https decryption. We need to be able to control URLs per-user or per-user group, and when we enable certain URLs (office365 for example) we need to re-write http headers to allow login only to certain tenants (similar to this KB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/tenant-restrictions ) However, we're going to want to control this for more and more cloud providers (adobe cloud, google workspaces, aws, etc) and each has a slightly different way they want the http header re-written to be able to lock down which users can login. \n The above is my most pressing need right now, and cisco umbrella can do this when using the more advanced flavors of the product and the cisco AnyConnect agent on the endpoint, however it's limited to like 6 cloud providers at the moment, and not flexible. \n So please let me know if you have a product you are happy with that can do the above. Now ideally this product would also replace our AV/Firewall/EDR as well, but that's sort of a secondary goal. \n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Helpful_Task7367  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently, this file server's a windows server with multiple SMB shares on for pretty much all work across the business. \n ​\n A new Dell ME5 Powervault has been set up running RAID10 with a single large LUN & volume. I have several queries on the best practice and configuration having only really worked with small setups single hosts, local storage etc. I'd like to ensure this is done properly.\n ​\n 1) Should I just attach the Powervault on iSCSI using windows iSCSI Connect on a VM, then place the NTFS files direct on here? Or would a large VHDX be better for any reason e.g. performance, security, backup then mount this to Hyper-V? Or even multiple smaller VHDX's due to the size? \n 2) Security wise without too much impact on performance what is best e.g. CHAPS, Full disk encryption on the PowerVault, separate VLAN between the Powervault and Hypervisor? This would be done using a core switch, I don't have separate hardware I could use for isolation. \n 3) Is robocopy still the best method using MIR or /XO and ran before and after cut-off of the old server shares?\n 4) Any other advise on best practices and security?\n    submitted by    /u/Imagination6942  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been working in IT for 10 years, started as a sysadmin and spent the past 5 years as a DevOps engineer. In each company I've worked for, I've faced the challenge of managing tedious requests from developers, like restoring databases after they've broken them or granting access to databases for investigating bugs, creating new repositories, adding users to it, service restarts, redeployment requests etc...\n Sometimes, it can be overwhelming and tiring to manage these tasks. I'm curious to know if other DevOps/system engineers feel the same way. Do you also find this part of your job to be frustrating and tedious, that you try to avoid it and start procrastinating?\n    submitted by    /u/a_gevorg  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Folks,\n I am going to struggle to articulate what I'm looking to achieve here because I'm not sure how I go about this. \n We currently have a suite of software delivered by a third party application - kind of like adobe creative cloud but for engineering.\n Now we had a policy change that means we no longer allow any user to be a local admin group member on any client endpoint. We instead use LAPS for the odd occasion when admin right sis needed.\n Before this policy change, the software suite was run via a service whose user was in every local admin group on all user endpoints, so this service no longer works and we're struggling to use other methods such as intune due to the size of the applications etc.\n So I guess what my question is, how do I make a service have the ability to run things as an administrator in the users login? \n The applications we install are all based on a network share and currently I run the application as the local (LAPS) administrator and then pass user credentials to access the share. Very clumsy. The alternative I have setup for now is a script that deploys via intune its mounts a drive as system using hardcoded user credentials in the script to mount the share as a drive then manually running a shortcut for the executable (this is hit and miss). \n My assumption is to run the service as system, but I don't think that this would be able to access network shares and also be able to interact with the user session for the install.\n Apologies if this is not very clear.\n    submitted by    /u/Hudson0804  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A year and a half ago I was dumb, needed my first IT job and they were the only people that would hire me. Help Desk Agent at $12/hr, worst fucking place I've seen. Users so dumb that I wouldn't trust with a car, let alone a computer.\n Then I went back to college, dropped that shitty job, got an internship at $30/hr; got 4 IT certifications, working on cool tech I never thought I would touch in a million years. Life's pretty good, and have been at my current employer since.\n However, these recruiters at TEKsystems will not leave me alone. They keep calling me at odd hours of the day asking me if I want to work for pennies, they keep sending me emails for job listings that are asking for the whole IT department in one person. No matter how much I tell them I make, a new recruiter comes by every week or two and does the same thing. It's like a bad ex that won't leave me alone.\n My advice to the new people trying to break into IT reading this is to never touch TEKsystems, and to never give them your information. There has to be a mom & pop shop near you that'll be much better to work for, these parasites will just keep calling you no matter what.

It always clears up after a few minutes.\n We have a dozen servers with exactly the same software and only one is doing this; vMotion to another host doesn't affect it.

Linux seems to accept any USB stick as a hardware token, as long as it's initially configured by the pam library. Alternatives such as nitro/solo/only key exist, and known brands such as kingston and verbatim have models on which Fido protocol is implemented.\n So what would be the point of getting a pricy yubikey ? Because yubico partners with big services providers ? Is a \"pam homecooked\" hardware token not crossplatform ? not accepted by these service providers ? Is yubikey the answer only because it embed additional NFC hardware/feature ?\n I'd appreciate any teaching from you guys\n    submitted by    /u/IndustryExpert9396  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are using a \"Zulty's\" system that has a phone app you can download, but half the time it doesn't seem to work.\n For example, if you receive a phone call, answer it, then end the call, you have to be sure you re-open the app, or else you will be stuck on \"On the phone\" status, meaning any additional phone calls will not ring to the app until you open the app again.\n So, my question is, has anyone ever had to deal with a situation where you need to route it through something else? Even if it is to route it through something like Google Voice, etc. we are dealing with a call group (our helpdesk line) that is hit or miss if the person on-call is receiving the phone call, because the app is terrible.\n My experience with VoIP is limited as you may be able to tell, but any suggestions are great. We can't move to another system with just that number / phone group as it's a part of a contract, however just being able to get a phone call through something whether it's through another app that is better would make our lives so much easier.\n Thanks if you have any ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/Steelersrawk1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our organization has been using Exchange Server 2016 for several years now, and we implemented a hybrid deployment with Office Online.

But we got about 40 servers from Lenovo about two years ago, and they have been nothing but a constant headache. Which fine, A bad firmware here, a faulty driver there, it has happened with all of them. The problem comes down to the support. \n Their support has NO clue what they are doing, Every time we call in, we have to explain the situation to them multiple times, We demonstrate the problem to them, and they cannot comprehend what the issue is. Like they've never done break/fix before in their lives, and so troubleshooting steps are foreign to them. Their knee jerk reaction to any issue is a motherboard swap. We've had the motherboard on a system replaced 7 and 8 times without resolving the very obviously firmware issue. \n The techs they send out are all contract, and other than replacing system boards have no knowledge or desire to do anything beyond swapping boards, there have been several times they have failed to update serial numbers and other things (I believe they have all been IBM techs). \n The newest experience has me laughing, We opened a ticket for a power supply gone bad, and they somehow confused us with another company, and Now we're invited to a teams meeting monday for their issue. \n Has anybody had a good experience with Lenovo support for servers? any tips? \n When I did desktop support, I LOVED Lenovo thinkpad support, they had amazing support processes, and super knowledgeable people, fast response times, etc. It has been the exact opposite with the servers.\n    submitted by    /u/aroundincircles  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a Software Vendor (I made a desktop app that I was looking to to sell), I found existing Software Licensing solutions (FlexLM, Sentinel, Wibu, Nalpeiron) were either prohibitively expensive to adopt and difficult to use, or just didn't have sufficiently robust capability.\n I think looking at it from the software Vendor's perspective is only part of the problem, since many end users also complain about licensing (more so than the vendors!). Looking through other threads, some of the big issues that kept coming up seem to be:\n - Easier to \"steal\" rather than install and activate correctly\n - Difficult to get buy in from higher ups to switch to a software with easier to work with licensing policies. We're talking monolithic On-Prem License servers with UI from the 90s that have never been updated used to enforce concurrency.\n - There is no single agreed upon standard, every ISV might have their own definitions for floating licenses, a seat, or a user-based license provisioning. This inconsistency makes SAM automation a nightmare.\n - ISVs sometimes prefer to prevent piracy rather than deploy in an environment that they cannot control (in a VM, for example).\n - Hardware Dongles aren't going away.\n - Node Locking fails often for many reasons (MAC address isn't persistent; you attach a new dock and the device fingerprint changes etc.). \n What else could be improved to make licensing software less of a headache for everyone? #opensource\n    submitted by    /u/LicenseSpring  \n [link]   [comments]",

No problem! we can set it up as a shared mailbox, and enable encryption on it.\n However, a phone call with the user, she also now mentions that she also needs her front desk to be able to log into the account to send scanned documents from this email and not just a shared email. This makes it a little more complicated because you now have to have a license attached to it for it to be logged into. No worries though, we can do this we just enable MFA (Now that it's going to be physically able to be logged into), give read/send permissions to the needed users so they can access from their email, and enable Encryption on the email. All done!\n Third call with the user comes, she now mentions that the email will be used for SMTP from a 3rd party with their application that they use to send out contracts, documents, etc. This is where it gets complicated, I have no idea how to keep this email secure with MFA (As far as my understanding, SMTP will not work with MFA enabled), we now can't change the password, or it's going to break the application from sending emails, and now we have 4 different people inside of this email that has access to personal, sensitive information.\n So my question is, how would you go about it to make this account secure and meet the requirements.

There is an IP in /ets/resolv.conf that can be used to access Windows but firewall blocks all requests from WSL by default, after some digging i could not find a way to fix it with firewall rules so i tried to disable firewall just for WSL's virtual network adapter and it worked.\n Here is powershell command, that i use: Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Public -DisabledInterfaceAliases \"vEthernet (WSL)\"\n I does the thing as i said but the problem is that every time i disable/enable firewall with it, firewall spits out permission prompts for every program that i already permitted before. Sometimes it is very annoying, especeially when permissions are reset for my DLNA and network sharing sevices and i can no longer access my PC via local network.\n Is there something that i'm doing wrong? Would appreciate any advice on how to configure firewall to allow outbound requests from WSL environment without having to explicitly set permissions for every program again every time.\n    submitted by    /u/john_daw  \n [link]   [comments]",

I basically did this because everyone on my team left my old job aside from a couple people, including my manager leaving and it was the only easy option to get off the sinking ship. I've been a Systems Engineer previously for about 10 or so years.\n I can either go back to my old job possibly but no one on my team is there aside from two people, or try to find a new job that is remote only. I've been fortunate that my last 2 jobs out of 3, I've put my heart in and have gotten promotions and been able to do things that helped the company. With my latest it's just not the same.\n Has anyone been in the same boat? There are some people that got me here at my current job and I feel like I might burn bridges but I want to have that fire back in. I just feel like I work best devoted my time to fix things at a company as opposed to coming in, doing a project and leaving. I hate the feeling of starting a project with a bunch of new people and rinsing and repeating with other new people. It causes so much anxiety for me. I prefer to go to midsize company and pave the road and make a name for myself (based on my previous jobs this has worked out...)\n    submitted by    /u/PepeTheMule  \n [link]   [comments]",

TLDR of that post was management was changing policy flip flopping back and forth and making our jobs harder because of it.\n I spent a lot of time at the old place complaining, and wallowing in my self pity. Thinking that I wasnt good enough and that there was no way another company would hire me. I blamed management for my unhappiness which is partially true but in the end it was my fault for staying and letting them make me unhappy.\n On the flip side yesterday I had my 6 month review at my new job that went spectacular. I found a place that is supportive and listens to employees to improve the company. It's not perfect by any means but no where really is. Since I've been here my mental health has improved, I've been eating better and I've lost ~60lbs. I'm learning more than ever and have the ability to move up in the company.\n Please remember that no job is worth your health. If you are not happy or your health, both physical or mental is declining, leaving is better than staying.

The master server setup and inventory is quite easy and the box is easily screwed down re: the security as far as OS and access for certain groups, correct access rights, logging, locked down firewalls as well. You know, the sane usual settings.\n One thing that really worries me is the fact that in order to use the Ansible setup properly we are going to have to create keys that have no password, are exempted from 2FA rules and can switch to root level access. \n The information on these servers \"is the business\" so if our data got lost it would be the end of the business if that makes sense. If the box got compromised it would be game over.\n In order to get the key they would have to exploit some creds to get into the box but its the sheer lateral movement/access that is gotten if these keys are misappropriated that worries me.\n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/IT_ISNT101  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All,\n We have an on Prem AD server which sync's out users to AAD using Azure AD Connect.\n Recently the On Prem AD server went pop which obviously has stopped the sync. My plan over the course of the next month was to Fully migrate away from the on Prem server anyway as there is no need for it any more. All of our Microsoft services are cloud based. We have no on site applications. All machines are connected via Azure and linked up to intune. So really all we use the on Prem server for is creating accounts. \n My question is... What would the implications be of just leaving the server in its current state seeing as though I was going to be getting rid of it anyway. Do the current users get converted to Cloud users automatically \n ...or is it advisable to restore from backups and carry out the steps of stopping syncs at both ends etc.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/BittenDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't find a single redeeming quality to this system. Every issue requires SSH access to the controller VMs, and either a pile of CLI or direct intervention from their support staff. In a 10+ year career I've never talked to support so much in such a short amount of time. Every firmware upgrade of the underlying host turns into a multi hour nightmare with crazy 2+ hour timeouts before a failure message. Every single feature down to what should be the simplest thing is manual, or a ratking of python scripts behind a sleek UI with bad progress reporting.

          "description": "Hi All\n Yesterday we had an alert from Microsoft 365 Defender (our Licenses are on 365 E5) notifying us of “Ransomware-linked emerging threat activity group detected “. Yikes!\n To cut a long story short, our security stack has contained the threat and the single device in question is nuked – We looped in 3rd party security to sense check everything.\n The threat was a Gootloader infection and Google suggests this is particularly nasty and sophisticated. The payload is a zip file with a .js file inside and from our investigation, the .js script needs to be executed, launched via WScriptexe. We implement best practice in our IT stack and are on-top of hardening our environment where ever possible. In this instance the payload was downloaded to a temp directory where Applocker blocks execution. But had the zip/.js file been downloaded to the desktop, it would have potentially executed.\n 1 suggested rudimentary mitigation for this is to change the file association of .js files (via Group Policy) to open with Notepad so if a user does click a .js file, it will harmlessly open in notepad - We have done this. \n But I have seen further recommendations to do the same for .vbs, .vbe, .jse, .hta and .wsf. I’m wondering if anyone else does this and if this could break anything for end users?\n    submitted by    /u/mythumbsclick  \n [link]   [comments]",

Furthermore, I have contacted SOTI directly and because the company doesn't exist anymore they don't have permission to unlock it so they can't help me.\n I can't seem to figure out a way to unlock it - they have me beat at every turn.\n - Developer options is blocked\n - In recovery mode, there is no option to factory reset the phone\n - I am able to get into the settings for about a minute before the mobicontrol kicks in when I restart the phone - otherwise settings is completely disabled\n - The factory reset setting is completely greyed out.\n - In recovery mode, the bootloader is blocked out | when I try to open it, it just says downloading forever with a green screen\n Any methods I can try to get this phone reset or alternatively get soti mobicontrol off the device?

For some reason this relative decided rather than going to me when they had a problem they would run straight to the local \"repair shop\" as he apparently was chatted up by one of their staff while he was at the chippy.\n This \"repair shop\" (and I use this dubiously) has made a fucking botch to put it lightly. They claimed he had a virus and that his \"hard drive\" (actually an SSD) was destroyed by it and he would need a replacement which he happily agreed to. They installed a \"new\" hard drive and sent it back to him, obviously with slower performance on acc. of having an SSD swapped for a HDD and no effort made to reinstall any of the laptop's basic drivers which can be pulled off the manufacturer's site with a few minutes on Googles, so this relative had no sound, no WiFi (lucky they use a cable connection, really!) and a prompt to activate Windows.\n When they took it back, they had the sense to call me this time. When I went back with this relative, they had kindly replaced his hard drive with a \"solid state drive\" and would only charge him £150, what a fucking deal! I actually had a look at the laptop at the shop and it was in the same state as before, no effort to reinstall any drivers, probably was just the same SSD they took out reinstalled and sold back to him at cost, and a prompt to activate Windows. I quite bluntly told them to fuck off, gave them an earful and walked out with my relative and the laptop in tow. Considering either legal or lethal action to get these tw@s to stop bothering him.\n Also, the fucking screws are threaded on the underside so good luck to me getting into that fucker again. At least they had the decency to install another SSD but that's nearly £100 of this relative's money down the fucking drain.\n    submitted by    /u/WindowScam2023  \n [link]   [comments]",

They have to connect with one of the other session hosts. On that session host it works for 1-2 days and afterwards the same issue occurs.\n The software is not installed on the vms but is started directly from a mapped network drive. It doesn't add or edit registry keys and only caches files in one specific folder in AppData. We already excluded that folder from the FSLogix redirection but it didn't make a difference.\n The only solution that works is to delete the FSLogix profile and create a new one.\n Additionally, Excel doesn't seem to work great either. Users have to restart it every few minutes because of freezing and crashing. Same thing, if the FSLogix profile will be deleted and be newly created it works again for a few days.\n So it seems there is something wrong with FSLogix. We already updated to the newest version and tried both normal caching and cloud cache.\n Weirdly I couldn't find anything or anyone on google regarding to this issue.\n Did anyone of you experience similiar issues or has an idea how to fix this? \n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/_Xephyr_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have tested installing IIS on this second location, using a different domain and connecting back to our global databases so only certain requests have additional latency. \n But this all seems really stupid, surely there is a better way.\n    submitted by    /u/Aromatic_Guard_4396  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I'm hoping that somewhere out there, someone has faced the same issue and maybe even found a fix.\n We have a bunch of Windows 10 Pro clients, and some Windows 11 Pro clients, which were initially on-prem domain joined, but have since become hybrid joined with AAD.\n My issue is that our users (about 500) have license for Microsoft 365 Business Premium, but only about half of the clients are running Business, the rest is stuck on Pro.\n Now, for some reason, it's exceptionally difficult to find any documentation on how this edition change actually works or should happen. Everything on MS, both on Learn and TechNet concerns Enterprise only, and even our CSP's licensing experts couldn't give a straight answer. (The first guy I spoke to, even claimed that there was no such thing as \"Windows 10 Business\"... o.O )\n Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a KMS key specifically for \"Business\", because if there was, I could just have the clients run a slmgr script silently, and that'd be the end of it -- and \"just buy E3\" (as another \"expert\" from our CSP suggested) is not en option either.\n Any insights, pointers or even encouraging comments are highly welcome and greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Imposing-Force  \n [link]   [comments]",

Are we overthinking it and it's actually not a big deal and it all works itself out through all of the updates? \n We just don't quite understand everything that's happening related to these updates and we'd rather cause some little bumps to get everything ready early versus one massive downtime issue when Microsoft sends out the last update and enforces the new encryption types.\n    submitted by    /u/xtigermaskx  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In order to increase room on the network for our rapidly growing office (with many lab devices as well), we decided to split the wireless network into a separate VLAN/subnet. That's all well and good but our three printers (HP MFPs) are all Ethernet only. Our original subnet that remains ethernet based is 10.1.26.0 /24 and the new WLAN one is 10.1.29.0 /24. They are connected on the back end via our Cisco layer three switch and talk to each other fine. \n People, when they're hard-wired, are able to print with no issue as before. However, I noticed that when on the new wireless network, they are having trouble reaching the printers that they have added on the other, hardwired based subnet with the drivers they have (though of course they can ping and access the web interface IPs fine). So far the solution is to remove those old drivers (added through the basic Microsoft 'add a printer' feature), go to the HP website and download/install the full official driver, skip past the step where it scans the network and can't find anything, and then manually input the IP address of the printer on the other subnet of 10.1.26.0. This then seems to work for both the wireless and ethernet subnets. But it is a few extra steps and a bit of work for the users, who sometimes may get confused or don't have time.\n Also, I noticed if you just use the basic Microsoft 'add a printer', 'can't find printer I'm looking for', 'manually enter the printer IP address', it just finds some generic or universal print driver that is not the most descriptive or useful, as it can't seem to find or offer an option for the actual precise driver.\n Anyway my main question is, is there a simpler way to do this, and advertise the printer easily and directly on both networks, or just make the existing printer installs on user machines work on both?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/overling  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since then. on around 2/3 of the PCs the domain accounts take around 10-15 minutes to load up, and when it finally logs in comes up with the error shown in the photo on this page (Except 2023 rather than 2019)\n https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Warning-1909-Could-not-create-Shortcut-Inventor-Electrical-Project-2019-Ink.html\n \"Warning 1909. Could not create Shortcut Inventor Electrical Project 2023.Ink\" when launching Inventor\n Any ideas what I can try. So far I've tried fresh uninstall and reinstall.\n Tried these instructions\n  \nNavigate to C:\\ProgramData\\Autodesk.\n Locate the folder labeled Inventor Electrical Library 2023.\n Right-click and select properties.\n Clear the Read-Only attributes at the bottom of the box and Apply. \n  \nAlso tried the master folder and subfolder and gave all users full access to read and write and modify where this shortcut is supposed to possibly be.\n I've also turned off Controlled folder access too via Windows Security. Local admin and network admin both log on.\n Not sure what else to try. Only thing I can think of is that the user domain accounts connect to a network drive and they can't access their C:// drives (except admin). But obviously reads all the program data from the C drive.\n I'm baffled why it doesn't happen on every single one though.\n ​\n Any tips for me to try?\n ​\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/jacklevics  \n [link]   [comments]",

Users who log in to their laptops have access to the internet, and then when some lock their computers and come back to it, the heartbeats aren't sent to the firewall and they're blocked from accessing the internet until they restart the laptop.\n We have a 3rd party who provide the equipment for us and \"manages\" them, and we've been on at them for 18 months about this issue. Their response tends to be to run a piece of software that pulls the logs from the machine which is then sent to Sophos. We've done this for so long with no real solution to the issue. I get the feeling the issue is with Sophos as they don't know (or care) why this is happening, so things are just stuck.\n I've been asked by my boss to find an alternative to Sophos XG Firewall, as a number of users are losing chunks of the day from having to restart their computers to get back on to the internet. The firewall must be user aware, so that we can apply specific rules to these users. \n Can anyone suggest an alternative?

          "description": "During the 2020 lockdowns we got fairly settled with a remote working configuration that involves our remote team using RDP on a thin client of sorts, remotely controlling a remote Windows 11 Pro workstation (via a VPN). We then either use a work smartphone for VOIP calls, or using remote audio redirection via RDP. Remote audio redirection works OK if latency is low (under 30ms), but we now have someone who has over 150ms ping to their remote workstation. Unfortunately this causes VOIP calls to have a LOT of lag (probably about 1000ms latency or more) and is generally not great. Before I send out another smartphone, I wanted to do a little bit of digging to see if there are better remote audio solutions available.\n When doing some research I found that some people were experimenting with to passing through a USB audio device, but I can't seem to find a way to do this on a Windows 11 Pro workstation - I enabled the group policy option for RemoteFX USB passthrough on my client PC but I still can't seem to find this as an option.\n Other people have suggested installing VOIP software on the local machine - but having to flip flop between the local and remote environment sounds really annoying.\n The last thing I've discovered is a tool called sound-over-rdp, but I can't seem to find any feedback as to whether it's a good tool or not. It also is a little bit on the expensive side of things, would rather not drop nearly $3k AUD for 5 users / servers.\n I did also find an open source project called USBIP-Win that allows for USB redirection, but it seems pretty complex. I had a quick look at their github and I'm not quite sure it'd solve my issue to be honest.\n Any suggestions on the best practices from here would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/stephendt  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was no option for me to suspend Bitlocker as the Windows I have doesn't feature that and my laptop stopped working, so I didn't prepare for that situation.\n Right now, every time I boot my computer, I am asked to input my Bitlocker recovery key, which is an inconvenience (I have the key backed up). I haven't been able to find solutions that match with this situation as most posts online focus on non-repair related issues.\n The Lenovo technician told me this: It's because the serial number on the motherboard doesn't match with the rest of the laptop. He suggested me that I should reinstall Windows 11, but because it was active when I booted post-repair, I don't think this would work.\n I also found out that there's a BIOS update, along with some other Windows updates that were there for the three weeks I didn't have access to the laptop. But given that the situation I'm in with the Bitlocker Recovery Key is due to a repair and not a software issue, how should I go about this?\n Thank you in advanced for advice! :)\n    submitted by    /u/ViridianWizard  \n [link]   [comments]",

Connect all power cables as they were before, and power up the UPS’s. \n Then just a case of confirming everything is back online and working as expected.\n Am I missing something?

I worked as a mom and pop hardware shop PC repair technician before coming here and was very forthcoming with my skills, knowledge, etc when I interviewed for this role and they hired me.\n It felt like a lucky break and I was so excited to work in a real professional and corporate environment under an IT professional that has been in the biz for almost 30 years. \n This was not what happened.\n My RM set me down and introduced me to a Team I'd be working with for support that i needed and they are based in India so I could come to them with any help I need. 3 weeks later, my RM leaves to UAE as well for an indefinite amount of time. Before he leaves, he gives me the most barebones training ive ever received and basically just told me to watch and learn and ill pick up everything i need that way. Every time I need access to something or to help someone out, I have to reach out to someone on my Team in India to grant access, monitor bandwidth, configure DNS, you name it, I pretty much have to ask someone to assist me because either I don't have the tools, or the understanding. Maybe it's a good thing as I don't know exactly what to do with the tools in the first place.\n Is this normal to be hired in like this and feel totally out of place and just constantly questioning if I'm doing a good job? Are there any tips anyone could give me or maybe empathize a bit?\n Any support is appreciated, \n Much thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Grant__W  \n [link]   [comments]",

We do not use O365 (we are on GSuite) but we do want to get Intune working to manage Windows devices. Our main requirements are to get Autopilot working so that we can just mail new users laptops without having to image, use Intune to manage endpoint policies, and use Intune to manage updates (especially feature updates) for older versions of Windows 10.\n When I researched this previously the \"EMS E3 (Enterprise Mobility + Security E3\" license was supposedly the best option to get all of this. Our VAR seems to think, however, that this does NOT include Autopilot or the ability to push feature updates. Does anyone know if it does or does not? We would likely not use the security features (currently on Crowdstrike) unless it integrates well with our other security products. We are a non-profit so we are hoping we qualify for the non-profit licensing discount but our VAR also thinks that we may not (no idea why they think this). \n We were also recommended to use this 3rd party site which also makes it seem like EMS E3 does not include Autopilot. However other people have told me that it does and that this site is incorrect. \n https://m365maps.com/files/Microsoft-365-Enterprise-Landscape.htm\n edit: This link makes it sound like EMS E3 MIGHT be all we need?

If you try to establish a connection to (business) OneDrive or SharePoint, it'll just stall out and do nothing, not even apprising you of the issue.\n That is, unless your 365 tenant still has the SharePoint policy which controls legacy access on \"Allow,\" then it works fine. But we don't and don't want to revert that setting just for this.\n Adobe is obviously a major company with the resources to have upgraded their products for this a long time ago--many others already have, including much smaller companies like Foxit. This leads me to wonder if it's purposeful: maybe they want you to use the Adobe Cloud instead of SharePoint.\n There's a sad little UserVoice entry about this with 8 votes currently (I think more reflective of the obscurity of what the problem is, perhaps combined with many tenants still not going to modern yet, than lack of interest):\n https://acrobat.uservoice.com/forums/926557-adobe-acrobat-for-sharepoint-onedrive/suggestions/45249598-add-support-for-modern-authentication\n    submitted by    /u/rpodric  \n [link]   [comments]",

I reach out to the CSM, and then magically within a few hours I have a support engineer beating down my digital door asking when we can schedule a phone call. The phone call takes place, I give them what they need, they say that they will get back to me. 2 days goes by with not a peep from them. Re-engage the CSM, and the cycle repeats. \n With our firewall vendor, it takes an average of 8 days for a resolution, even the most simple of changes. I've brought this up to management multiple times and they say that we don't have the manpower right now to take our firewall duties in house nor do we have the manpower to research and negotiate a contract with a different firewall management company.\n I don't know if it's a staffing shortage or just poor management, but this is incredibly frustrating because I have management at my company asking why these issues aren't resolved yet and I hate shrugging my shoulders and telling them that I'm in a perpetual state of waiting for support to get their act together but it's the truth.\n    submitted by    /u/_twokoolfourskool2_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can say that and other IT admins will hopefully respect that. \n Yet it just feels when you see a leaver asking you about the process of keeping my IT business assets when I leave it's like do we owe you that. It's not yours. It's the businesses. Yes you have a phone number that's the businesses line number. Your iPhone the one that says property of XYZ.com is again a business asset. Also the laptop which is a corp laptop with a corp image on it with corp licensing on it is not yours they still seem to think it's ok to ask for this when they leave like it's a sentimental thing ? \n Then it comes your manager asks you to make sure they transition you off everything and give them the guidance you should of done this and that. In work hours when you have other actual jobs work related jobs to be doing. \n Why do businesses not stand up and have a stern stance on this.

Keep in mind this is my first step up from IT specialist to sys admin so bear with me OGs.\n We are operating on a 2016 Windows Server and this holds all of our drives. The business is about 100 people. In November, I installed the .NET Framework 4.8(KB5020614) and the Update for Windows Server 2016(KB5019964). I have had non-stop issues with connectivity to the drives ever since. The errors string from \"local device name is already in use,\" to \"Target name is incorrect.\"\n I have found limited success in doing ipconfig/release-renew-flushdns. It's usually a 50-50 chance that the issue resolves after that. If I use the IP address to the server in the file explorer address bar, it immediately pulls up; its the complete opposite when I try to call it by its name \\\\server1\\. I've checked the DNS and DHCP to see if they're properly communicating and there seems to be nothing wrong(not ruling them out).\n As recent as yesterday, I have started to force our user computers to use a different IP through the IPv4 in adapter options. For instance, I'll make 192.168.8.113 go to 192.168.8.204. I have found complete success with this and the most odd part is I can set the user machine back to automatically grabbing an IP address which will revert it to 192.168.8.113 and it instantly works. \n It seems like I'm forcing the previous session to end and renewing the lease on the DHCP ??? I don't know but I'm open to all suggestions as my boss(the owner) grows in irritation. \n Thanks ahead of time.\n    submitted by    /u/Zelliion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now we have a new system that will run \"dockerized\", that environement is a composition of 7-8 containers that run together to deliver that service (mysql, redis, nginx and some other images).\n How do you deal with that \"in general\" regarding the management of such stuff?\n Do you create a bunch of linux hosts virtualised inside hyper-V and manage them with some container orchestrator (any tips - can be commercially backed and cost something)? So, something like a virtualized cluster?\n Do you build something completely \"aside\" like a bunch of synlogy nas with docker support? or even a complete new hardware cluster?\n Using windows servers for docker stuff does not make sense imho. \n Thanks for any recommendation :)\n    submitted by    /u/funkyferdy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ok so while typing what was going to be the original post this has started working, but for no apparent reason. This has now gone from a request for help to a quest of understanding.\n So a while ago I was doing some fiddling with a client Synology, had created a new backup folder, unmapped the old one, attempted to remap the new one. \"Invalid Password\". Ok sure, that happens sometimes, thing is I didn't actually need the drive to be mapped as the backup software (backup assist) could see the location and access it with the given details so I figured it'd be fine. Decided to fix mapping the drive after the next scheduled reboot.\n Everything was not fine, turns out that despite being able to see and access the NAS, when attempting to actually perform the backup task it would fail as \"unable to access the network location\". Keep in mind, all I have done is make a new 2023 subfolder in the backup folder (we're MSP, they like it that way) and try to map it back after removing the 2022 folder.\n So I make a new user, try to map it with that, nope, same thing. Despite being able to log into the device with these same creds that Windows doesn't like.\n After that I restart things, bash my head against the wall a bit, find some other people who had similar problems that came about as the result of a setting change (none of mine have, double and triple checked), so I come here, begin writing my post, and mid way through I decide to try to map it one more time.\n It fucking works.\n And I haven't even done anything. I didn't even have to type the details in, it just immediately worked and mapped it like there'd never even been a problem.\n    submitted by    /u/TheKingOfSpite  \n [link]   [comments]",

This particular user has some of our customer files SharePoint doc libraries synced with OneDrive to his local machine.\n If while we are on the call, his password is changed, SharePoint and files access removed, doesnt this take some time to sync? I believe the last time I removed some ones Azure files access, they had it for several more hours. Is this the same for Sharepoint? We do have \"Automate\" installed on his machine, so I could force a reboot, but if he is not on the VPN at the time, the password might not sync and still be cached. I did some research and saw there is a registry item that can be changed.\n Although I could wipe the machine with Intune, I do want to be able to go through the machine and make sure he does not have local files that need moved to a project directory on the network. \n Will a password change instantly cut his access on his phone as well, or do I need to revoke those tokens as well?\n I would appreciate any suggestions to make this as streamlined as possible, its not something we are particularly excited about having to do, but they are leaving us no choice.\n    submitted by    /u/eld101  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So this may be a stupid question and maybe I'm reading too much into it, but here's where I'm unsure:\n I deal with Cybersecurity Insurance Questionnaires for our clients. A lot of times it'll ask if server databases are encrypted at-rest, and from my understanding and from what tools we use, this is basically asking \"Is Bitlocker enabled on server data disks?\" and the answer is typically No.\n However now I have this question for a client who's servers are all Azure VMs. These do not have Azure Disk Encryption enabled, which from my (potentially limited) understanding, means Bitlocker is not enabled on the virtual disk. However, Azure VMs by default live on Microsoft's data centers, and the physical disks in those data centers have server-side encryption (SSE) \n So my question is... does this count for at-rest encryption as far as this cybersecurity questionnaire is concerned? Because from my (again, probably limited) understanding, at-rest encryption is intended to protect against someone getting access to the physical disk, and sure this would prevent it if someone broke into the Microsoft data center and somehow stole the disk this VM lived on so that would seem to make the answer to the question \"Yes\" in the most technical sense. But if someone gained access to the Azure environment & stole the VHD file, then Bitlocker isn't enabled on that file and could presumably read all the contents then it's like... was at-rest encryption really even on? Is at-rest encryption explicitly a protection against physical data breaches? Or should at-rest encryption include VM disk encryption when the server in question is a VM?\n Or maybe I'm thinking too hard about this?\n    submitted by    /u/The0  \n [link]   [comments]",

The remote connection cannot be started.\"\n Interestingly, some users still worked fine however, and these were users sat next to each other in the same office.\n Now, we've seen issues where the signature can throw off the RDP file sometimes so we edited the file in notepad and removed both the \"signscope:s:\" and \"signature:s:\" values, this allowed it to work, obviously this bypasses the whole \"digitally signed\" part of the file.\n We checked the usual before this, ensuring all the certificates were valid etc. (they were) and no weird updates had been applied to clients or the relevant servers (they hadn't) so we deployed this file to affected users.\n However, we then got a report from another customer with the same issue, then a third reported the issue. Our initial thought being some sort of CA issue, but two of these customers used Sectigo, the other was R5/GlobalSign so that ruled that idea out.\n We couldn't find a reason for this so eventually just had to remove those two lines from the files and it seemed to resolve the issue. A cursory glance around the Internet only really flagged this issue when using self signed certs, we aren't.\n Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! At the moment we have only seen this at 3 (maybe 4) customers but obviously don't want to see this get more widespread!\n As an additional point, the RDP file \"breaks\" regardless of where it's used from, so it doesn't look to be the originating network that's the issue.\n    submitted by    /u/Delodien  \n [link]   [comments]",

But how do you handle a lost or broken key on accounts that you do not have full administrative control over, such as a social media account? If you require your staff to register a backup key, does that not create other issues (my knee-jerk reaction is end users would end up carrying the backup with them so they can always have it to register both at once, or would forget to bring in the backup key so it never gets registered, both of which defeats the purpose of the backup key) or do you require that the IT department register additional keys on MFA setup?\n Am I overlooking something obvious, or is this just something that sysadmins just deal with? It would seem to me that the best way of solving this would be if a YubiKey/similar product could be \"paired\" so that one key could register both itself and a cold backup key that is stored elsewhere (held by IT in a corporate use case) without having to carry both.\n Thank you for any insight,\n    submitted by    /u/Party-Cook-1666  \n [link]   [comments]",

Like all good sysadmins I did my google searching forever on this and there is not one thing (rebuild profile, reinstall Office, repair OST, rebuild OST, turn off bad add-ins that do nothing but slow you down, reset the navpane, everything) that hasn't worked. The ONLY thing that works is once it gets into that state, a quick reboot fixes it for another 4 hours. I keep saying 4 hours because it's been close to clockwork when it happens 4-5 hours later.\n Talk about an annoying piece of crap. We all can have our rants on crappy MSFT software updates and programming. However, I have had a few other users with the new version of Outlook with similar issues, but the beforementioned methods have worked (but it eats up precious time none of us have). The difference with my users is they are all Windows 10, and I was the idiot that was smart enough to upgrade to Windows 11.\n Any thoughts? Other than the IT guy is an idiot (I hate that I can't even figure out my own stupid issue)?

I'd just like to know if anyone else has had subpar performance for Dialpad in Aus or NZ?\n Note) Did an Ookla speed test with an end user today reporting issues and they 278 down 114 up with 4ms to server, so I'm thinking very unlikely an issue on our side.\n    submitted by    /u/hvytrdtrnngtffndngn  \n [link]   [comments]",

But that rarely happens since they don't go to their secretaries first when something goes wrong.\n Part of us is like, \"eh, they are at the top of the pyramid.. whatever.. just help them then open a ticket for them and move on.\" Another part of us is like \"no, they need to follow IT policy like everyone else!\"\n Just curious if this is an issue for the companies you work for?

Because these lists are on-prem, and devices are in Azure, there’s not much users can do to manage these lists. I’m curious as to how you handle this on your end. I was thinking about possibly migrating these groups into Azure, but not too sure on any repercussions of that change. I also thought about a 3rd party tool, but it may not be worth it, if there is something I can do with what I already have. Appreciate any thoughts or comments you may have.

I did some more monitoring and saw that the cpu queue is sometimes a bit to high (about 5 - 10 for a 16 core VM).\n So i like to spread the user over more servers and read about the sizing guide from microsoft. Our users working with the office programs, ERP System and doing normal surfing and research via MS Edge and Google Chrome. Due to this workload i would say that its categorized in the heavy work load / power users.\n For that Microsoft says i should use 4 vCPU and about 8 GB RAM per User. Thats beeing said for our about 140 User, i shoud have about 144 vCPUs and 1 TB RAM. Thats seems quite high for me. Usally i dont provision 1:1 CPU ratio. \n Microsoft also say, i should not provision more then 2 users per vCPU. Thats still 72 vCPUs for all. Due to the workload i dont get a good ratio about real threats and vCPU (on Hyper-V). \n I'm quite curios about other RDS farms with about the same workload. I read some threats on the internet where 20 Users are on a quad core system with 16 GB RAM. Other wrote that they have 8 Core, 32 GB RAM but just provision it to 4 users.

The reason: The effort to configure the firewall is too great or the Windows firewall would be pointless anyway. I would now like to change this situation and gradually activate the firewall on all servers. The problem is also that the necessary IPs and ports are hardly or not at all documented.\n ​\n Now my question: How would you proceed to achieve this goal? Simply switching on the firewall would instantaneously paralyse most servers. Firewall\n My idea would be: First document the active connections with netstat and write corresponding rules, then activate the firewall with Allow-Any for a certain time and then study the log to find more IPs and ports.\n ​\n I am curious about your suggestions and thank you in advance for your ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/admin_mt  \n [link]   [comments]",

We offer some apps (including M365) as remote apps through RDS. We use Windows Server 2012 R2 (yea yea i know, we are upgrading asap)\n For the people saying, why don't use the local M365 apps. Our back-office system only works good on TS-systems and needs Outlook and word for some functionality. \n The issue is, when people open attachement in this outlook app or from our back-office system. The outlook 'home' page (The page with inbox and all your e-mail) stays as the focused the screen. The openend attachement or e-mail from our back-office system stays behind that outlook screen until you open it from the taskbar. \n I am getting the feeling it is an Server 2012 R2 issue or a remote app issue. When we used RDS with desktop for our users, they didn't have this issue but we used Office 2010 then and Exchange 2013.\n Thanks in advance,\n Kind regards,\n Roy de Jonge\n p.s.

          "description": "So we have this guy that works... \"works\"... with us and we've noticed an increase in the frequency that we see Netflix up on his computer, through his browser. Now, we don't have a problem with someone pulling up Netflix while they work for background noise, if it helps them get the work done more efficiently, I myself have YouTube videos up while I'm working, it helps me concentrate and get my work done, and my boss doesn't have a problem with it. The major issue is that this guy doesn't really do anything, just sits on Yahoo! all day and watches Netflix. So we were thinking, we should block Netflix on his computer. The only problem is, Netflix has thousands of IP addresses, and trying to block, or redirect, based on IP would take a long time, time that we don't really have.\n So my question is this... does anyone know of an effective way to block Netflix on a domain computer, and only that domain computer? Blocking the site on the network completely is not an option, based on the nature of our work environment, so we need it to be just for one computer. We also do not want him to know that we actively blocked it, he has a bad temper and flies off the handle when things like this are brought up, and retaliation is a real fear, so a redirect to localhost is preferred. If it's not possible, I get it, but we need him to not be on Netflix all day.\n NOTE: 1.) My boss can't fire him, he's been trying. 2.) He's tried talking to him about things like this before, it doesn't work. 3.) HR has been ineffective at helping the situation, their advice as \"All you can do is talk to him.\"\n    submitted by    /u/RicketyGaming  \n [link]   [comments]",

They had 2 external drives plugged into the computer for backing up but apparently the last time anything was done on the drives was back in 2020 and there weren't even any backups. Is there anyway to recover the SSD without formatting or is it a total loss? The company does not have IT, they call us whenever there's an issue and we offered to do cloud backups a while back but they're cheap and refused saying they'd do it on their own.\n Update: the computer was windows 10 but they were running server 2019 on Hyper V.

I found out that if I dont want the lowest tier office laptop, I am gonna pay around 700-800 € (which is my budget). For this price, I can find some lower tier gaming laptops (10- 11th gen intel, rtx 3050, 144 Hz displays which I find very comfortable to work with). \n Thats where my dilemma starts, would you rather buy a mid tier office laptop, but not have the ability to use it for entertainment, or aim for lower tier gaming laptop which may have some disadvatages ( overheating, weight, noise)? \n My best options I found on the web so far:\n Office laptops: DELL Latitude 15-3520, ASUS Vivobook 15X OLED X1503ZA-MA437W,\n Gaming laptops: MSI GF63 Thin 11SC, Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15IHU6 Shadow Black \n All of these are approximately 800€ (you can suggest different).

I work for, they are largely a windows shop and while they have been generous to provide admin rights on developer machine. Basically their development process is very manual and limited automation.\n So trying to get automation in is rather challenging due to the firewall. EG: I cannot use terraform as trying to use it from the terminal fails due to the proxy settings. Similar for minikube or pulling from the docker hub. In December there was some screw up because I could actually pull docker containers from hub.docker.com. When speaking to the infosec people they keep telling me we need static IP's so that they can allow those sites. However trying to find out who can assign static IP's just results in the run around. \n Surely there is a way with windows group policies to allow developers in that policy to get access to terraform/npm/docker?\n I think the firewall solution is from fortinet if that helps with suggestions.\n ​\n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Majestic-Extension94  \n [link]   [comments]",

But now I want to ask about aftermaths of boot-repair. So, my system was working like this before:\n  \nUbuntu with Grub\n Windows on hdd\n  \nSo what I did is I unplugged every drive, I installed Windows on new m2 ssd, connected old hdd (where my old windows was located), transfered all data and formatted hdd so it's now just a storage for windows. Then I connected ssd with my ubuntu and run boot-repair from my usb flash. After that grub got fixed and I can choose between new Windows and Ubuntu, and it's all working.\n But one thing that bothers me is that there's still old Windows left on grub menu, even tho I formatted old hdd with Windows. Also in UEFI there were added more options to boot from, like ubuntu (m2 ssd) and ubuntu (hdd) even tho ubuntu is not installed there at all. I have the logs from boot-repair saved, if they're safe to share, I can share them. Also I can screenshot my partitions if it's needed, just tell me what to run, I'm not a pro in such things, and it seems like no-one in other communties can help me (I asked this question many times), so please don't delete the question, because last time I asked here something, it got deleted even tho it didn't violate any rules, but I was lucky enough to get the answer before it got deleted, so I came here again, as my last hope, not trying to violate anything.\n My question is, should I be worried about something? Or it's not of a big deal and I can forget about it? It also says when I'm booting to Ubuntu \"failed to set APST feature\" and something starts going on, and eventually it loads after a little time and works fine, new Windows on m2 ssd works fine too.\n    submitted by    /u/Zakepanka  \n [link]   [comments]",

While designing and implementing systems is fun, the detective work appeals to my inner curiosity.\n Much of my research around getting started in this field suggests learning an OS in-and-out, a close-second is learning a scripting language. Because I work in a Windows environment, it's sensible to start with Windows and PowerShell. This makes sense, but I don't know how to go about tackling the former. \n There are some books, like Powershell for SysAdmins, that can teach me Windows administration through PowerShell--hitting two birds with one stone. Is this advisable or should I begin by learning Windows core processes and its other components independently of PowerShell so I don't get overwhelmed?\n I fear I'm overthinking this, and I'd welcome that constructive criticism if that's what's going on. Helping me develop this area of my roadmap would be much appreciated. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/4alloween  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you have any idea how to fix it or even another way of doing things, I'd appreciate your advice.\n To preface, our public folders contain mailbox enabled folders that have their own aliases that external users e-mail regularly. Our current setup allows only users assigned a public folders role to have access to see the public folders as its own entity under folders in their Outlook client. No one else sees it. For the migration, we are using BitTitan.\n In Office 365, I set up the public folder and using BitTitan, migrated the stuff over. I set explicit permissions using the public folder GUI in the Exchange admin center. However, everyone is seeing the public folders as if it's a shared mailbox shared with everyone. I've found out how to limit unauthorized users from accessing the content, but the public folder mailbox remains. Any ideas of how to get rid of the mapping entirely for certain users?\n    submitted by    /u/Powerful_Hospital_91  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hands down, the most incompetent group of \"technicians\" I've encountered in ~20 years of working in IT.\n Our ticket was escalated to the higher tier of support and they initially attempted to help. But once none of their recommendations worked, they said \"Unfortunately your product version is no longer supported.\"\n I replied saying that can't possibly be true, as you all are still actively selling the product. So they backtrack and ask, \"May I know proof of purchase?\" To which I responded that we no longer have the receipt. But sent them the activation key, the email used to originally purchase the software, and a screenshot logged into said account on our registered products page.\n From here, they send, \"Another user may be able to help you get an answer in one of the forums\" to which they provide a link that just goes to their parent company's main page with no forums mentioned anywhere.\n So I inform them of this... and the response? \"May I know proof of purchase\" - same exact guy I have been speaking to this whole time. \n I open a second ticket in an attempt to get a different technician. Specifically ask not to get \"Mr. XYZ\" and I end up back with him anyways. We have the exact same conversation mentioned above and this is a never ending loop. We got so frustrated we decided to say fuck that software and bought a similar one from a different vendor.\n TL:DR - Corel bought Roxio. Their support sucks dick for gas money, and then rides their bike.\n    submitted by    /u/grapplerman  \n [link]   [comments]",

A lot of it is emails going to multiple people because of how teams and distribution groups are setup.\n I have sent out training to users on how to create rules and manage the volume of mail with retention policies and even showing them how they can bulk delete them selves online, but it seems to be getting too much and users aren't following direction. We have tried shared mailboxes for some teams, but due to the volume of mail and people accessing it, it tends to crash outlook and does more harm then good. \n I have a meeting with Front's technical team, just want to know if anyone has tried to make the transition to a software like this and is there anything I am looking over? And or how have you overcome the problem of high volumes of email?\n Concerns I have:\n  \nWe have around 1000 distribution groups which we would have to use Microsoft's SMTP settings for each distribution group and would be a manual setup for each. The other option is using Front and their servers and updating our SPF/DKIM records, though then Microsoft will then not have a record of those outbound emails.\n Adds another point of failure for email, as now if Front goes down everything will be forwarded to their system.\n Learning curve for end users, we would have to switch around 80% of our company to this.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/IT_Guy_101  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to extend my apologies for potentially wasting your time, but I felt it was important to reach out and share my recent experience.\n Recently, I was working on our ESXi cluster and FC Fabric to add another storage system.\n I had to reload the FC zone, and despite knowing that the other switch should carry the load, the system briefly halted, causing me great concern. My heart raced as I feared the worst, but fortunately, the failover worked as expected.\n I understand that moments like these can be incredibly stressful and can take a toll on one's mental and emotional well-being. I empathize with anyone who has experienced similar situations and want you to know that you are not alone.

Things have evolved a little and I am certain the lockouts are coming from Exchange, but I have looked through every Exchange/IIS log I can find and I am unable to find corresponding attempts to access these users' mailboxes. \n I finally enlisted Microsoft Support after reaching my wits end with this issue and dropped the $500 on a ticket. After a day and a half of intermittently working with them to investigate the issue, they came to the conclusion that...the Exchange server was the source of the lockouts...\n They admitted that I knew that when I submitted the ticket, so they told me they were going to refund the cost of the ticket, but we need to reach out to premier support for a RCA (root cause analysis) as they had reached their limitations in assisting us (they didn't even get as far along as I did in my own investigating...). \n So I reached out to premier support. Where I'm told you need a premier support contract to get support from them. That contract, I am told, starts at $53,000. $53,000 is what it would cost us to get support from Microsoft, on a Microsoft product, that we already pay heavily for for the \"privilege\" of using...\n Does this align with anybody else's experience?

Your expertise and kind words helped me take action and improve my situation. Some of you even reached out to me in private to help me out with writing a CV, Configuring the network, fixing the VMware issues and so on, so i feel like i owe you guys an update. \n I compiled all the evidence I had of rude and stressful interactions with users and wrote out my account of the situation from memory. Then, I printed everything out and went to speak with my workplace leadership. I was acutally shaking so much you could hear the paper move LMAO, but I explained in detail how a certain boss treated me, including how he asked me to break the law to get something he wanted (I had email evidence), and how much it stressed me out when he would be angry that i didn't follow through. I also explained how this workload was too much for one person to carry, and the person I spoke with took me seriously, and I was put on sick leave with pay until I can see a doctor. They're launching an investigation into that boss starting from the very top, and addressing the rotten workplace culture in a discrete manner.\n I have a doctor's appointment on Monday, and I'll most likely get a mental health sick note to take some time off. As for the job interview I mentioned, it didn't work out because I didn't have some Office 365 Certs :D but at least I have time now to look for something better! Also, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW ULTRA CORPORATE THAT PLACE WAS, It almot felt like a cult where everyone was one \"giant happy family\"! \n Once again, thank you all for your support and advice. I truly appreciate it and feel like I've played my cards right to improve my situation.\n    submitted by    /u/Voyagerlol  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some said Yes by confining the scope of the analysis to the drives.\n Others pointed out that a single RAID controller or power supply failure would defeat the HA nature of the RAID drives.\n Wikipedia states:\n There are three principles of systems design in reliability engineering which can help achieve high availability.\n Elimination of single points of failure. This means adding or building redundancy into the system so that failure of a component does not mean failure of the entire system. Reliable crossover. In redundant systems, the crossover point itself tends to become a single point of failure. Reliable systems must provide for reliable crossover. Detection of failures as they occur. If the two principles above are observed, then a user may never see a failure – but the maintenance activity must. ....\n It strikes me that there is an important distinction between having some redundant components and having no single point of failure.\n I can see that RAID alone has good capacity to improve availability, but I wouldn’t say RAID is HA.

Currently all RDSH Servers are VMs Virtualized using Hyper-V as the Hypervisor.\n By the looks of it I need a Enterprise NVidia GPU that is compatible with the Server (Dell PowerEdge R640 for example can support an NVIDIA T4 GPU).\n However reading online, Microsoft have removed vGPU / RemoteFX Support from Windows Server 2016 Build 1084. So this is a no go.\n I think I need the following:\n > An Enterprise Driver License from NVidia\n > A physical GPU installed in a Server, for example the NVIDIA T4\n > A Hypervisor that supports vGPU\n Looking on the NVidia Website, it looks like this is only supported using the following Hypervisors:\n > VMWare vSphere\n > Citrix Hypervisor 8.4\n Both of the above Hypervisors are incredibly expensive in terms of licensing. If I use what I currently have (Hyper-V - Server 2019) this would not allow vGPU or Remote FX, but would only allow physical mapping, so 1 x Physical GPU directly mapped using DDA to the Guest VM RDSH.\n Am I missing something here, how are other enterprises adding Shared vGPUs to their Virtualised RDSH VMs to improve performance?

I wanted to alert other candidates about the red flags I found during the hiring process. However, the company somehow managed to trace the review back to me, and I have no idea how they did it.\n To be honest, I'm not even scared or intimidated that they found out it was me behind the review. I've been job searching since I got laid off, and I don't care about burning bridges at this point. Companies already burn bridges with their bad treatment and terrible hiring processes, treating employees and job candidates as disposable assets.\n The hiring manager even sent me an email to schedule a call with him to clarify some of the points I made in my review and to see if there's a job opportunity for me. But I've been burned by corporate so many times that I have serious trust issues with companies. At this point in my life, I don't believe anything that comes from them, especially if they start dangling carrots in front of me.\n I admit, I'm curious to know how they traced the review back to me, but I'm not willing to risk my privacy to find out. I also want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with Glassdoor reviews being traced back to them. What are your thoughts on this situation? Should I take the call from the hiring manager, or is it not worth my time?\n I'm open to any honest feedback and opinions.

What I'm looking to better understand is at what point does administration become engineering. Based on my experience the line is thin and dependent on the organization that you work for. The way I've reasoned this out in my head in the past is that administration is mainly monitoring/maintaining while engineering tends to be more focused on the planning/creation/building of infrastructure.\n It appears that a lot of employers tend to blur these lines. Though it could just be skewed perspective based on my experience.

I was looking at rsynch and it has a block level synch option, would that possibly work? \n My main concerns are if the full RMAN dumps would trigger rsynch to send a full each time this won't work, but if it's smart enough to only send changed blocks each night this should be workable. The initial full will be the worst in terms of host impact and time, we will seed it locally if possible.\n Are there better tools for this type of host based copy approach? DBAs do not want a formal agent-based backup app, I understand there are better approaches.

In principle I could do all of that programmatically within the application, and simply distribute it as a standalone exe. Would an MSI/App-V/MSIX container be preferable to that?

They started having downtime on Friday, December 2nd at 2 AM and by 6 AM on Saturday had revealed that they experienced a security incident. So I immediately switched off onto a CPanel account that I have just to get my email back up and running (it was just one email address). I finally got access to the restore of my PST file. So what I have is the following at this point: \n  \nAn 86 GB PST file with email from 2018 to December 2nd, 2022.\n Emails form December 3rd through today that I use WHM/Cpanel to host. It's Maildir format if that helps. I use Thunderbird to check it.\n  \nWhat I'd like to wind up with is getting onto Office 365 and import the PST file. That should be straightforward. However, how can I take the email from December 3rd until now and get that into Office 365? Perhaps I could setup a separate Outlook account with IMAP that pulls from my CPanel mail account and then just drag the emails from IMAP into my new Office 365 account?\n Or does anyone else have a suggestion on how I could accomplish this?\n Thanks,\n John\n    submitted by    /u/geo1999  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have three main offices and a few satellite offices all connected through Meraki VPN tunnels. We have just over 400 employees/contractors.\n On-Site I have two Dell SAN’s, one for production and one for on-site backup. Seven ESXi hosts and ~33 Cisco switches. Cisco CUCM VoIP system and ~90 VM’s. A Synology for off-site backup.\n In the two other offices I have Dell R series servers, one for back up and one for production.\n Now down to the “meat and potatoes”. I do it all from on-boarding to off-boarding to keeping all the hosts, VM’s, switches and other hardware updated. I babysit employees/contractors everyday with the stupid things you read on here every day. I work 60-80 hours a week. In 2022 I worked every holiday there was. I used 7 hours of PTO time the whole year. I’m 59 years old and I’m tired. The kind of tired you can’t sleep off. (what is sleep?)\n Management refuses to let me hire someone experienced to help. (they let me hire a 17 y/o intern about a year ago) but he didn’t last.\n I make a little over $100K with a $13K bonus in 2022. There’s a ton more but that’s the gist of it.\n Opinions? Comments?

(pgpwde --add-bypass --disk 0 --count 6 --aa)\n Copies SED reflect drivers to needed folder for use during upgrade\n Create variable OSDSetupAdditionalUpgradeOptions to include the above reflect drivers\n Upgrade to newer version of Windows 10\n Restart computer\n Re-register the SED password filter\n Disable SED bypass (pgpwde --remove-bypass --aa)\n Reboot\n Decrypt SED encrypted drive (pgpwde --decrypt --disk 0 --aa --all)\n Uninstall SED\n The sequence goes on, but the above is the pertinent bits.\n  \nThe issue I'm having is that the \"pgpwde --remove-bypass -aa\" command is failing after the upgrade.\n The error I'm getting is -11977 Improper Initialization, which I can only find one reference when Googling, which is: https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=f100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427&CommunityKey=8deae12f-88a6-4d88-9186-231c4ca171d7&tab=digestviewer#bmf100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427\n Which references Linux.\n The removal of the bypass only fails before a user logs in. Once a user has logged onto the machine, and back off again, then the bypass can be removed.\n So, my thought process is that, perhaps, SED isn't sully started when Windows starts, resulting in a weird state where the commands won't run until SED finishes starting, but I'm not sure SED's underlying mechanics enough to remediate this.\n It's also an older version of SED, like 10.4 or something.\n    submitted by    /u/Nakatomi2010  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even though im still always doing things.\n I was curious as to if anyone else here has ever done such a good job at a company, that the company felt they were no longer needed because everything always works and there are very few pr minor issues happening?\n I also ask because when i first started my job here, there were fires to put out every day. The question every day was \"what are we fixing today\". And according to staff, this was the norm for many years. They havent had their systems consistantly work for years. \n Over the course of the past 2 years ive been here, i have fixed many problems and was able to make it so people are no longer asking \"what is going to break today\", and they can confidently do their job. However, i have found that i am not doing as much work as i used to now. Half of the day is making sure everything is still working fine, or coming up with new ideas/projects to work on for improvements, and the other half of the day is just studying and researching because there really isnt too much else that i can do. And this is unfortunate because all of that work and research nobody can trace or see that i am doing it, they can only assume. Or for the worse, assume im not doing it.\n I realized that, to the everyday staff worker, i went from always walking around helping people and always being seen, to basically being a hermit who never has to leave his office. I dont think that they will let me go because they do love what i have done, but the anxiety side of me worries that if they dont see me actively doing something, they will think im not doing anything, and given nothing is breaking to fix, im no longer needed.\n    submitted by    /u/CleverKrunk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Previously, our staff users have had a home drive \"U:\" on one of our file servers. We're currently in the process of migrating these over to OneDrive for Business, but for some staff we're finding that after we've migrated them, they are sometimes not seeing all their other network drives in File Explorer on Windows 10.\n We currently map network drives using logon scripts - Group Policy Preferences would not be practical as different users need different combinations of network drives - these scripts are batch files with commands like net use v: \\\\SERVERNAME\\SHARENAME$ /PERSISTENT:NO.\n For the vast majority of users these are working fine but for some reason, intermittently the network drives don't show up in File Explorer. We tried re-running the logon script but that said the drives were already mapped. We went to try mapping the drives using the Map Network Drive wizard in File Explorer, and we found that the wizard could actually see the network drives. This led us to discover that restarting File Explorer made the drives visible.\n We tried setting the EnableLinkedConnections registry entry (e.g. as per this ServerFault post) but this did not help.\n We tried enabling NETLOGON debug logging on computers where the incidents were reported, but the NETLOGON debug log didn't show any obvious causes.\n Can anyone suggest what might be causing this issue and how we can resolve it? Other than having our users restart File Explorer every time their drives go missing?\n    submitted by    /u/danj2k  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need some advice on how to handle guest users in our organisation's AzureAD/InTune environment.\n I'm quite concerned about the security implications of how it is setup currently.\n Without getting into too much detail our organisation has clients that walk in off the street and use our computer lab to work on relatively confidential documents.\n Before my time our we had setup several generic user accounts for non employees to use e.g. guestuser1, guestuser2, etc.. for the guest users which is obviously is going to leave behind traces of the files and logins stored within the user profile from the previous session which is not ideal. So I need to come up with a better solution.\n Relying on staff to send new user requests for each new guest and having me to create them and assign them office licenses is just going to be way too cumbersome.\n I need something that will allow guests to login to specific PCs with just access to the web and ms office with minimal intervention from IT.\n Wondering if anyone has been in a similar boat and what they have tried.\n    submitted by    /u/Wello4500  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are currently just finishing up some of the prep work on our Exchange such as moving everything over to AD sync, migrating resource rooms etc before we start doing User Mailboxes.\n One of the questions is what's the best licensing model? We are looking at getting rid of our Anti-Virus and going with Microsoft Defender which comes standard with M365 E3 and M365 E5. My manager has decided to pitch the idea of going with a mixture of Business Standard and Premium with adding on Exchange Online Plan 2 (For some employees), InTune and Microsoft Defender license ON TOP of the business standard and premium.\n Are there any benefits that the M365 E3/E5 provide over the Business Standard and Premium if we add those extra licenses on top or would it just be smarter to go with the M365 E3 and E5?\n The manager has pitched massive cost savings but doesn't really make sense to go with Business Standard/Premium with the add on licenses opposed to just forking out the extra money for M365 E3 and E5?\n    submitted by    /u/Blitzening  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our CFO knows all about the ins and outs of budgets/cashflow and is very knowledge in his field. Our Head of HR knows all about policies etc. Our C level exec of law is VERY knowledge in law.\n Its not just past jobs either, you wouldnt hire a head of medical surgery that had no idea how to perform any surgery. You wouldnt hire head chef who couldnt cook. Imagine hiring a head of Marketing or Sales who had little to no idea about marketing or sales.\n I'm not saying you need to be hyper technical about IT to be a CIO, but you at least have to be good at it in some capacity in ADDITION to have good soft, management and leadership skills (just like any other C level position). I'm not advocating hiring a technical person who has crap soft skills btw. \n Is it just that finding someone who is technical and has the above skills is to hard to find in IT?

          "description": "About 5 years ago I set up a small network for a restaurant in the Caribbean. They wanted some IP cameras, a POS system and a slot machine server installed. I used an inexpensive Netgear router, an unmanaged POE switch and an LTE box for internet. All cabling was Cat 5e. A year later they wanted to add a guest network for the adjacent hotel. I set this up, but used a completely separate network infrastructure. I used ubiquity APs due to budget constraints. My thought at the time was by separating the two networks, it would keep the business network bandwidth more secure and wouldn’t bog down the cameras with the guest network traffic. \n Currently the business is expanding, adding several more buildings to the property, creating a campus like environment. They want Internet and cameras on all these new buildings. Since I have these two separate networks, I’m starting to realize that it’s going to be much more expensive and redundant putting two sets of switches for every building. Also a couple of the buildings are across a road with very rocky soil. Max distance between buildings is about 110 feet. I want to know the best way to proceed with this project. I have a few questions:\n 1) How are networks designed for say college campuses or hotels with several buildings when it comes to critical networks and simple Wi-Fi? Do they separate things?\n 2) Is there any reason to keep the two networks separate in my case.\n 3) What is the best way to segregate the network traffic, forming a more secure, prioritized network for the POS and camera, and a less secure network for guest WIFI?\n 4) I want to use fiber to span the buildings, but If I am forced to use PTP wireless bridges (due to very rocky soil), can I use one PTP bridge to support 2 vlans?\n Thank you in advance for your help.

We are coming from a stable and reasonably complicated network with IP routing to the access layer and separate VLANs and subnets on every switch for distinct devices types. \n We are looking at ways we can build upon our existing design and stability but take advantage of features that fabric that mean we can change the design to suit each system. One thing that interests me is the possibility to move back to having L2 segments spanned across the entire estate and assigning a /24 subnet for a particular system such as CCTV. We can then give the service owner the /24 and tell them wherever they install their devices they will sit on the same subnet and if the system doesn't work they can't complain about devices not working over L3 when communicating with each other etc. \n One of the problems with this approach is deciding where to put the gateways, what to push to the firewall or to keep on the core. We were looking at pushing critical devices gateway to our firewall for most control but also I am wondering about VRFs/segments and controlling traffic with routing rather than just spanning L2 to our firewall?\n Any advice or tips appreciated on how to best take advantage of fabric without making a mess.

I'm an IT professional with a focus on Azure/AWS security & compliance. While I have some networking experience in my homelab, I'm seeking some guidance because of some key constraints that I have to navigate.\n Here are the requirements:\n  \nOne subnet for a POS system called Toast. This subnet is highly managed by the vendor. No \"unauthorized devices\" can be connected to this subnet. The vendor provides a Meraki Z3 router and an unmanaged switch. Downstream from those, there'll be two receipt printers, three POS kiosks, and a cash drawer. Endpoints on this subnet will be hardwired. No wireless.\n One subnet for all non-POS equipment. For this, I'm planning on purchasing a Meraki Go Router Firewall and a Meraki Go Access Point. Endpoints on this network will all be wireless. No hardwired. \n  \nWe'll have five static IP addresses available. The kicker is that Toast POS explicitly forbids the presence of an intermediate device between the ISP's gateway and their router. Normally, I'd put a router firewall in front of the Toast POS router and isolate it on its own VLAN. Since I can't do that, I'm not quite sure how to create two subnets while meeting the POS requirements. Is it possible to connect both routers directly to the gateway, assign a static IP to each, and isolate the traffic on the gateway? I suppose that will depend on the capabilities of the gateway device. Comcast hasn't told me what unit we'll be getting yet. \n Just looking for some guidance here.

I want PC 1, 2, and 4 to be able to talk to each other 2. All PCs within their own boundary should be able to talk to the other PCs within that boundary only (with the exception of above)\n  \nI can not modify the IP addresses already assigned (everything is on a 192.168.1.0/24). I can change the gateways.\n \nI can not modify the switch attached to 1.50 and 1.75, assume its an out-of-box L2 switch\n \n I'd like to use ACLs to complete this by controlling the outgoing traffic from each layer 3 switch. (i.e Fa0/4 with an out ACL to stop PC5 from reaching outside its boundary).\n To my understanding one (of many) would look like (middle switch):\n interface FastEthernet0/10\n ip access-group TO_NORTH out\n !\n ...\n ip access-list extended TO_NORTH\n permit ip host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.1.50\n permit ip host 192.168.1.1 host 192.168.1.50\n !\n I recognize there's an implicit deny at the bottom, that should cover anything not listed from \"leaving\" the \"boundary\". After I apply this ACL to the port, for some reason all traffic no matter the source or destination still passes through that switch, port, and ACL as if it was never applied.\n ​\n I think i've dug my mind into a rabbit's hole and have confused myself over what I believe should be rather easy. Do I need to have routing enabled or GW set somewhere specific? \n if there's any more info i can provide, lmk\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/Hox6  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey there,\n I have a NetBox server with 2 CPUs and 8GB of RAM. It also runs a webhook handler specific to NetBox. These webhooks will make basic changes via Ansible, like update a port description or change a port's mode based on updates to interfaces. However, there have been times where I've tried to update 10+ interfaces at a time, which will then cause the webhook handler to take on 10 webhooks/execute 10 scripts at the same time. This seems to spike CPU usage for varying amounts of time, depending on the number of interfaces I attempted to update. The spike causes the VM console to freeze up and often causes some of the webhooks to not execute properly.\n I'm just curious if anyone else is using their NetBox server as a webhook handler, and if so, what specs it's deployed with to get it to work smoothly.

I have used routers before I have used switches before but not an “L3 Switch” as this is known as. Interface g0/0/0 is the L3 “WAN” and g0/1/0~3 are L2 “LAN” ports. I literally just want this to act as a router between the company firewall and our domain controller but I can’t for the life of me get it sorted. What I’ve done so far is create two VLANs that are assigned to two ports each example VLAN 20 is on g0/1/0-1 , VLAN 30 is on g0/1/2-3 This is only a 4port switch plus the WAN port. I assume I need to do PAT on the device but am struggling. Any advice at all is much appreciated, I will answer whatever questions you got for me to the best of my ability.

We have on prem ERP and CAD software as well as file shares. \n We are currently testing a China Telcom SD WAN solution. It gave us a modest increase in bandwidth (6M). I expected the latency to increase due to last mile hops. Latency went from 280ms to 300ms. The problem is that we still have more than acceptable packet loss. There are periods of 10-20% loss.

My team has the need to test PoE on switches, often times several dozen, so a device that tests multiple ports like this would be really useful.

Have a Watchguard Router and Unifi AP's/Switches.\n Ran into an issue last week where our 16-XG died. Would keep shutting off randomly. Couldn't find one available immediately, so had to reroute the cables to a different switch on the rack while we found a replacement.\n Got a USW-Pro-Aggregation to replace it.\n Switched everything to the new one, thought we were all in the clear.\n Started getting emails around 11/11:15 at night that VPN/network was down. Reboot the Watchguard and everything is back up and running. Get the same messages in the morning around 6:30/7 pm. Watchguard reboot fixes it again.\n More of the same all week, thought I might've plugged a cable in wrong somewhere, and that was causing issues. Gone over all of them, and everything looks to be fine. Thought maybe our backups were causing the issue, since they run at around 11pm at night, kinda made sense.\n Turned off Backups last night, same thing happened.\n Turned them back on tonight, and same thing happened.\n In the Unifi Console, the amount of clients on certain switches doubles. The switches at times show a Down speed of 79641 Mbps, but average 300-1000Mbps. Clients also show a huge download. But on the PC's I can't see anything being downloaded. Looks like there's a ton of traffic from the backups using Wireshark. But my knowledge of Wireshark is very limited.\n The only way to get things going again is by rebooting the Watchguard, or one of the network switches.\n Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/PM_ME_HOT_RAMEN  \n [link]   [comments]",

It'll only be for IoT devices that's related to the dc operational needs, like cctv, electrical or temp sensor, etc. There will be 5 floors, and approximately around 17 thousands of ip or endpoints will be used.\n So i'm considering using vxlan for the sake of IP efficiency and broadcast storm prevention, since there'll be 5 floor and the switches will be put everywhere.\n Is there a best way to do the segmentation?

Even telnet to ports do not return anything (which seemed like an indicator of a firewall in between)\n - However, there are no firewalls or access lists in between my Macbook and the destinations - I confirm this since this is the network that I manage and own, and there have been no anomalies detected. No routing configuration changed.\n - I can ping/traceroute using ICMP to the hosts\n - Another colleague's Macbook, in the same source as 10.0.1.0/24 can connect to mentioned host without problems\n - I have done tcpdump with the following commands, which return no packets if the traffic belongs to one of the affected flow (say the host I'm trying to connect to is 192.168.13.13)\n sudo tcpdump -nnvv host 192.168.13.13 0 packets captured 0 packets received by filter 0 packets dropped by kernel \n - For a certain Window DNS server in 192.168.13.0/24, I can use it to resolve the DNS queries (via dig). I cannot, however, connect to it via RDP (while I was able to just one week ago). Tcpdump displayed DNS requests/responses, ICMP requests/replies, but no RDP traffic even coming out of the Macbook\n ​\n This has recently happened.

          "description": "I recently implemented some ties between a small number of racks in a DC using FS 24 fibre MTP polarity solution. We used all SMOF components (standardising on SMOF in the DC) consisting of: 24F Type A Cassette <> 24F Type A trunk cable <> 24F Type AF Cassette. This works and allows standard A-B patch cables on either end when patching. Essentially Port 1 maps to Port 2 on the remote cassette (rolling the fibre). However, there was a bit of confusion during installation as each A cassette had to match with an AF.\n  \nI understand polarity with the 3 solutions for MTP-12 (Method A, B, C). Are these exactly the same for MTP-24? \n Could we have achieved the same result using 2x 24F Type A cassettes, and a 24F Type C trunk cable in between? \n What are others doing for inter-rack patching in the DC - sticking with straight-through 1-1 polarity (A/A/A solution) and using A-A patch cables on one end, or using the inter-rack MTP to roll the fibre (either with a A/A/AF or A/C/A solution)?\n  \nI'm also looking to break out some 400G and 100G ports to 4x100G and 4x10G respectively.\n My understanding is I would use a QDD-4X100G-LR-S or QSFP-4X10G-LR-S connecting to a 3 x 8F MTP cassette (each cassette could break out 3 ports from the switch) using a MTP-12 Type A trunk cable.

          "description": "I'm running a VxLAN EVPN fabric with Cisco NX-OS 9.3(11), which has a DCI to a legacy DC (DC1) I'm migrating away from. The DCI setup uses EVPN multisite for the border-gateways in the new DC (DC2) and vanilla vPC VTEPs in DC1. I'm transitioning from a classic setup in DC1 with VRRP on the SVIs, to distributed anycast-gateway in DC2. The plan was to stitch the vlans between DCs via the border-gateways, then per vlan when half the hosts are migrated shutdown the VRRP SVI and bring up the anycast-gateway SVI.\n I've realised that for vlans I've stitched across the DCI, I can't reach the anycast-gateway address from hosts in the legacy DC. The VTEPs in the new DC just don't advertise EVPN routes for those interfaces. I guess this makes sense conceptually, as the anycast-gateway is intended for hosts directly connected to the leaf. However I do need some hosts in the legacy DC to route via an SVI on the border-leafs in the new DC as part of the migration process.\n As a workaround I tried spinning up an SVI with VRRP on the border-leafs in DC2, which I thought would be a valid workaround which I could then transition to anycast-gateway once the vlan was emptied from DC1. But the SVI is suspended as soon as I remove fabric forwarding mode anycast-gateway from the SVI config.\n Is this a known behaviour in VxLAN EVPN with anycast-gateway, that you can't combine a FHRP and anycast-gateway on the same leaf? Or perhaps a specific limitation with Cisco NX-OS?\n I was hoping to avoid having to extend all of the L3VPN constructs to the vPC VTEPs in DC1 as this is a manually managed DC (new DC is operated with Apstra) and this would increase the complexity.\n    submitted by    /u/Notworker  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Peplink routers have emerged as a leading choice for businesses and individuals alike, thanks to their innovative features, reliable performance, and user-friendly interfaces. \n One of the most distinctive features of Peplink routers is their patented SpeedFusion technology, which enables users to combine multiple internet connections for increased speed, reliability, and security. This technology allows for bandwidth bonding, seamless failover, and intelligent load balancing across different types of internet connections, such as DSL, cable, fiber, and cellular.\n I had the opportunity to choose a Peplink Balance router for multi WAN support, load balancing and failover solution, which I liked a lot, but at that time I realised that it holds a very small market niche, and it is not very popular. Peplink might not have the same level of brand recognition as some of the more prominent players in the networking industry. This could be due to a combination of factors, including limited marketing efforts, a smaller advertising budget, or the company's focus on niche markets. Consequently, many potential customers might not be aware of Peplink and its offerings.\n What's your experience with Peplink, if any?\n    submitted by    /u/_ReeX_  \n [link]   [comments]",

The URL that Gophish needs to listen should be public but can't be directly set to 2.2.2.2 when creating a campaign it should be localhost(1.1.1.1). I've got an SMTP relay service setup with verified identities and can send emails successfully. The problem is that usually everything gets hosted on the internal VM(1.1.1.1) in my case or in articles is shown on EC2 instances with Gophish installed, and domain pointing to it. But in my case the internal VM is not open to the internet and connection must go through 2.2.2.2. My goal is when a link in the email is clicked to lead to my domain example.com?rid=516313 and to open the landing page I've configured, and when the link is clicked to somehow find its way to 1.1.1.1 through 2.2.2.2.

I've recommended managed switches for these locations as many of them are automated sites with no personnel. I'm getting pushback on 2 issues. Our security consultant is recommending we put in unmanaged switches. They are cheaper, they can't be compromised from the Internet (cue scary music) and if a redundant link goes out you just ship out another cheap switch. Secondly, if we did go with the managed switch option, he is insisting that the OOB mgmt port doesn't plug into our trusted network but instead goes through the firewall. Apparently plugging it straight into the trusted network would immediately cause a security audit to fail.

So now I am trying to connect the projector to the network through the access point (with a different ssid) while the laptop remains on the main ssid. In this configuration the laptop cannot find the projector. The projector successfully connects to the network with its static IP, however on the laptop side it can’t be found.

In the interim, I am trying to do some AAA implementation and getting hung up on a specific set of commands I'd like to restrict if possible.\n I am trying to restrict the Tier 1 techs in a way that allows them to manipulate a VLAN's tagged/untagged ports, but there are other commands under \"vlan\" I'd like for them to not be able to access. So, to add a port to, say VLAN 10, as untagged it would look like this:\n switch(config)# vlan 10 untagged ethernet 16 \n The problem is, it seems that I can only either allow no access to the \"vlan\" command tree or allow all. I say that because I do not know and have not been able to find a way to tell TACACS to allow the user access to the list of VLANs (since they are user defined) or the port number. I've tried using an asterisk after the \"vlan\" entry like so:\n vlan * untagged ethernet * \n And other variations of this, but nothing has seemed to work.

Hoping you all can help get me on the right path.\n Setup: all 1G managed switches, Some connected by copper some by fiber/SFPs. Low low client count (under 100). There’s also a cable company provided gateway/router which spits out 192.168.0.x DHCP addresses internally. They also pay for two static IPs 10.x.x.x that currently go to some standalone ubiquiti server that routes them and handles the wifi internet access point traffic currently. The idea is to retire all that soonish. Keep if we must.\n All i wanted to do was set up this new network of switches i mentioned above on its own subnet (192.168.2.x) and everything on that subnet would be static IPs - and connect it at one place on ine switch with (i had assumed) A static route so anything not .2.x would get pushed to the cable company gateway/router and to the outside world. The .2.x subnet is for a POE camera system for them so thats why i was thinking keep it separate.. flawed? There’s also wifi 6 access points they want to add later for internet connectivity, and retire the old ubiquiti setup.\n Is this the right idea? Or should i swap over everything to be on the .0.x subnet? Should i leave everything on DHCP?\n Thanks..\n    submitted by    /u/jct111  \n [link]   [comments]",

When our customers were pushing more than 50k pps and a few hundred mbps starts to drop the VM's packets. However, the server load and the network load are very low almost nothing.\n We were start tune the network and the Kernel of the host as AMD/Intel recommended to see how it goes. Started using Vhost and multi-queues but now we are seeing a heavy load on the CPU from the Vhost/network which is higher than 70% of the CPU time with only a small number of VM's on these servers. Around 60VM's with low usage on CPU and 500Mbit (110k pps) on the network. The two Epyc 7h12 with 256 logical cores are pushing around 80 percent of the CPU and more than 60 percent of it is from the network/vhost. Now we don't have packet drops but under a heavy CPU load.\n Here are the configurations and changes we made.\n We have started with this 3 months ago\n -netdev tap,id=nic0,ifname=$TAPIF,script=no,downscript=no,vhost=on,queues=8 \\\n -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=nic0,mq=on,vectors=10,mac=$MAC \n Still had packet loss.\n Latest config.

          "description": "At the moment we are looking for an improvement in our data centers. We have two separated DCs that have redundant layer 2 dark fiber connections (not in use). In both datacenters are collapsed core topologies which are then connected to the campus core. The datacenter Vlans are routed from the respective collapsed core, i.e. the SVIs are located on the core VPC pair. The VPC peers share the gateway IP using HSRP.\n Since we want to connect both datacenters with layer 2 and the vlans should be available in both datacenters to move VMs back and forth comfortably, the question is how to solve this in the smartest way. My extensive internet research, unfortunately, has not brought a perfect solution. In addition, the documentation is often outdated (OTV/DCI etc.).\n One often mentioned possibility is to have 2 gateways in the DCs with two HSRP groups, but this does not seem to be a suitable solution. I was thinking of pulling another layer into the topology, so that the collapsed core layer becomes the aggregation layer. Above then comes a real core layer with all SVIs and again HSRP gateway. One VPC peer of the core layer would then be in the first DC and the other VPC peer in the second DC.\n Does anyone have an idea or a suggestion or is there no getting around VXLAN for such concepts nowadays ?\n    submitted by    /u/lolaoosljslolul  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not sure what I could use as a client to test against a 100gb network, but the switches are very oversized currently.\n However I know there is a lot more I could look into. Even if I don't use it I enjoy learning interesting things and what I learn today will likely get used when the next absurd network requirement is asked.

I’d consider myself to have intermediate network knowledge and I need some advice. …\n Currently I purchase 2 static IPs from my business internet provider. I use one for my public router, the other is for the company’s Fortigate which tunnels to corporate. The setup has worked well, but I’m slightly limited. \n Since I’ve converted to VoIP, our non business class routers don’t do a good job handling traffic for 10 phones, even with QoS on and SIP disabled. \n Currently, I’ve migrated the phones to behind the WAN. The Fortigate handles them much better, but I’m limited. There are blocked ports, some of which affect phone provisioning. The Fortigate is corporately controlled. I’m able to access the UI, but it’s connected to FortiManager for its config. Making any changes that large would throw a big red flag. \n Should I keep the two statics, or should I save money and migrate to a single DHCP? If so, what can I put behind the modem to manage traffic (on the cheap!). Can I provision a managed switch to handle the ISP, QoS for the phones, and separate the traffic for the Fortigate? Do I have to buy something expensive like a Ubiquiti VLAN capable device? I’m open to any ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/sinklayre  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ok, so hopefully someone can advise here.\n We have quite a complicated setup which I'll miss a lot of information out to keep this brief... we have an OSPF instance (OSPF 20) with our ISP. The ISP advertises several routes to us including a default route and a route to one of our remote branches among DCs.\n We also receive a route to our remote DC from another OSPF instance (OSPF 10) with our internal routers. This is redistributed into OSPF by the neighbor route as an E1 route.\n At present, the route to the remote DC that is making it into the routing table is the one from the ISP (OSPF 20), while we want the traffic to route internally via OSPF 10.\n I've tried a few ways to fix this but can't seem to crack it. I though using a route-map against a distribution list on the ISP OSPF instance to set the metric higher would work if I matched the route I was interested in, but it seems to filter out all routes from the ISP EXCEPT the one I want to affect.\n I feel like I'm missing something crazy obvious here, any chance one of you geniuses can help me out?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/paraffintrippin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Networkers of reddit,\n This issue first came up with a client that couldn't process their CC transactions after coming back from lunch. Essentially they could not resolve xyz domain and further examination revealed other domains also not being able to be resolved but 95% of domains on the internet are being resolved.\n Ive pegged it down to the Fortigate(s) simply because if we Ethernet into the back of Comcast modem DNS resolves to these specific domains. Alright so then I remembered our own business uses Comcast business and also has a Fortigate 61E and I can reproduce the problem on our network. I even noticed now I cant even hit the slickdeals website to which I was just checking it out last week on my machine. OK so I if i know the IP and setup a forward zone on the DC to the IP for the domain it routes and comes up. If i setup my machines DNS to googles/openDNS/comcast DNS it still will not resolve. If i nslookup using another DNS server besides the domain controller it will not resolve. I feel this eliminates the windows DNS DC(s). Packet captures show the DNS requests going to the DC out so I dont understand why the requests are timing out. I can double check the WAN packet capture but why would it fwd DNS request for certain domains and not others?\n No changes have been made to the Fortigates OS 7.x on any of these separate sites and neither have any web filtering rules other than blocking foreign countries inbound. There are no external connector feeds to 2 of the sites and ive disabled them on our site. I can replicate this problem across 3 different places across the city the only correlation being they are all on comcast business using fortigates across multiple workstations. Software upgrades on the fortigates are manual so I can only think of something being bugged, exploited or i need other ideas. I hope ive explained enough to get some insight from you guys.\n    submitted by    /u/Dmakes3  \n [link]   [comments]",

The EVE-NG team has not given much support on this subject, so I here I am asking you fine folks for help.\n Has anyone here gotten cEOS and/or custom docker images to run in EVE-NG?\n EDIT: Why am I getting downvoted? If you do a search on the subject you'll find that there is only ONE resource talking about how to run custom docker images on EVE-NG, but that is using docker-in-docker, which I want to avoid due to the performance tax. (The whole reason I'm using cEOS is to get better performance...).

It connects to the VPN using TheGreenBow.\n I get good speeds, around 70 MB/s for file transfer, which is good for me.\n The problem I have is weird, and probably something I don't know. When I try copying a file from any remote device to my local client, it will allocate the client's ram for the size of that file. If I start a 5GB file copy, quickly the Ram usage will ramp up by 5GB. I need to transfer 60GB files, so that's a big issue. Once the transfer is done, it DOES NOT free the ram...\n I do not have that problem if I launch a copy from another drive or a local NAS.\n Any idea or explaination?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Remy4409  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know how to configure MLAG in the Arista using Port Channel and MLAG configuration. To do so, I select the interface, for example, interface ethernet 2, under that interface, then I create the “channel-group 20“ with the number and mode. Then I move to the interface “port-channel 20”, and associate that port channel with the mlag number (let’s say 20 as well). I'll do the same on the second switch so both switches know they are part of an LACP/Port-Channel with MLAG connection in case switch one goes down. \n Just need to know how I would configure MEC on the Cisco C9500 in a Stackwise Virtual mode.\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/fmaster007  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mostly phasing out older stuff, helping out our SD teams and working on incidents that occurred. Also we're occasionally involved with on-boarding new clients, fitting their needs. And other projects (think: new PoPs etc).\n Honestly, it kinda feels 'stale'. I like to play new shiny stuff once in a while. play around with it, see if it fits our use. For example software/tooling for QoL, other hardware, else. \n Reflecting on other engineering teams in other branches e.g. motorsports; they have engineers with a clear goal: win a race within certain rules. I don't think we (as NWE's) always have these clear rules. There is -however- one clear goal: it has to work. It mostly does not matter how (no clear rules).\n How would one create some kind of 'race' to squeeze every bit from a router. Having no jitter, or making sure you lose no packets in transit?

All 3 other switches' interfaces aren't working. All commands show the stack is functioning as normal however...\n 'show switch' shows all switches are a part of the stack no problem.\n ' show switch stack-ports' shows all is good with the stack cables\n Nothing in the logs is showing anything out of the ordinary, except for %SPI_FC-3-HIGH_WMARK_REACHED: Number of messages in the queue for channel 11 has reached maximum. Which i'm reading is a known bug on this code... shouldn't be an issue with stacking.\n We're able to reload all other switches individually with 'reload slot x' command, and reloading all other switches (except for the primary, because we dont want to reload the working one during business hours) didn't seems to fix it. After reloading the other member switches, they join back into the stack just fine. \n ​\n The member switches' ports are simply just not coming up. It's showing no link activity like there's no cable even plugged in. Tried bouncing the ports, and unplugging/replugging in cables, no luck.\n ​\n Has anyone ever ran into this? The plan is to reboot the whole stack tonight after work hours to see if that fixes, which i'm hoping it does. It has an uptime of 2 years also.\n Any advice would be appreciated!!\n EDIT:: The reboot fixed it! Of course next step is to get them upgraded.

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n We've had Cisco routers on order for over a year now and their ETA keeps getting pushed further out. I am wondering how prevalent different virtual router products such as VyOS, TNSR, or even CSR1K/CSR8K are in the enterprise non cloud environment for replacing traditional ethernet routers used for internet edge and private WAN connectivity. I understand there are some (very) large and small businesses that make use of them, but would like to understand how \"ready\" are they to replace traditional hardware-based internet/WAN routers? Most discussions around VyOS tend to be around home use rather than enterprise and VyOS/TNSR seem to be only occasionally mentioned in enterprise networking related discussions.\n Also, does anyone have experience with technical support for either? VyOS looks to be < $20K per year for unlimited installs and 1-4Hr support SLA. I feel I'd have a better time convincing management to try a products other than Cisco if they can be assured that they have decent support. There also aren't many concrete performance numbers published for VyOS but anecdotal evidence suggests that 10Gbps+ should be achievable even when hosted on ESXi. Are there any \"gotchas\" to look forward to with hosting any of these on ESXi as far as functionality, stability, and performance?\n Thank you all for taking the time to read this.\n    submitted by    /u/the_mastermind0  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am particularly interested in risk management (not security risk but potential impacts due to change).\n The ITIL framework is useful however there is an element that I struggle with, potential customers impacts, normally when defining potential, we might think as the worst case scenario, but even small simple changes could have big potential impact if we consider a typo when adding a new policy in an existing vrf, someone might say deleting or modifying policies are riskier, and I would normally agree, but when it comes to typos, missing a statement, wrong IP, community tag, etc, could have severe consequences.\n In my organization we have defined these categories to come with a number, the number will fall under ITIL thresholds, P1-P4, these are the categories:\n Potential Customer Impact, it is based on the activity being performed and the amount of customers potentially impacted.\n Type Element, it is a grouping that depends on type of element, for example, a core IP layer element would have higher value than a Voice or Data(Application layer) element.\n Service Area, based on the geographical area that the element is providing services, example, it could be region of a country, a state, it could be within a city.\n Service Density, amount of actual services that the element is supporting.\n As you can see, Type, Service Area and Service Density are based on the element where the work is going to be performed, but the Potential Customer Impact is based on the activity itself only.\n My struggle is finding a good balance in the risk management for the activity itself as there are many details like typos or missing small pieces of configuration that could create a big impact even though the activity itself could be a simple one. \n How does your organization manage risk from changes?

Because of the physical limitations of our fiber connections, we only have one trunk interface as the heartbeat interface between the two core switches. I set Core Sw1 as primary for all VLANs and Core Sw2 as the secondary for all VLANs. The configurations were successful and when I pull the ethernet cable going to our ASA, the traffic still flows through Core Sw2. However, when I unplug Core Sw1, we lose connection on the entire network. \n Quickly explaining our Core to ASA connection: the connection from Core Sw1 and Core Sw2 is a single cable connection from each of the Core Switch. We only have one ASA running on the network at the moment.\n What could be causing this problem? I brought up setting up STP root manually so that the VLANs have a cost to follow to the Distribution then to Core Switches, but my Supervisor is insisting that doesn't matter. If I can get a clear technical explanation as to why our failover isn't happening when Core Sw1 loses power it will be very helpful.\n    submitted by    /u/networkthinggy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All. We are an IT consulting form and commonly perform site surveys for clients. Most of our clients have small to medium sized sites with between 5-20 APs. Lots of small warehouse clients that we do this for.\n Currently we use free predictive wireless heatmapping tools, and the free Wi-Fi analyzer tool to provide heatmaps and recommendations to clients. We basically use the existing AP placements and predictive heatmap tool to make an approximated heat map, then go onsite and use Wi-Fi analyzer to confirm the accuracy of the predictive heatmap and look for interference and optimal channels to set. It's pretty manual but fairly easy/not complex for us to do.\n Also we help them by recommending Wi-Fi settings such as the channels, etc. This has seemingly been enough for our clients and they've been happy with the results. We're able to make plenty of recomendations using our method.\n We've actually had clients tell us that another competitor came in and did a survey with other (paid) tools and the reports were overly confusing to them and took too long.\n We're starting to raise our prices for site surveys more towards what our competitors are charging, so I'm looking into paid site survey tools to see if they can provide anymore value to clients or efficiency on our end. \n What would ya'll recommend? We do around 1-2 surveys a month, mostly for small clients like I described above. I would prefer something cloud based, something we can easily install/license on our laptops (for our team of 5 engineers), no physical tool, and affordable (don't think we need something like Ekahau for these smaller surveys?). Right now I'm looking at NetSpot. \n Please let me know what you would recommend and why.\n    submitted by    /u/bhcs2014  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am a working Network engineer but I have not done this specific config before. Funny enough, cisco makes this 100x harder than all other manufactures. Also costs 4x. But I have the routers so that's what were running with.\n Key Notes:\n Cellular SIMs are Private static routable IPS. These are not accessible from anywhere outside of this Private subnet provided by carriers. Meaning The VZW sims can talk to one another, and the ATTs can. But not between the two carriers. In addition these SIMs cannot reach the internet. Internet cannot reach them. (this is a paid service from the providers)\n I am starting with simple site-to-site VPN tunnels. redundant setup. Tunnel 1 between VZW sims. Tunnel 2 ATT SIMs.\n With this setup, I figure all I need is to tell the router. \"Hey always use VZW Cell interface, if it fails, go out ATT interface.\" Since both cellular connections are live, and they both have tunnels. The failover is simply switching the interface the traffic is going out.\n IMAGE BELOW:\n https://ibb.co/Q8tDvrL\n    submitted by    /u/PoweredByCory  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been working with TAC forever and 4500 switch tack blames firewall, firewall tac blames switch. Because of the way the firewall fails over and keeps the same IP address but on the other firewall makes me think there is something with ARP table that is not allowing the IP to change for that MAC address.

But performance inside the data centre to internal devices is fine which leads me to believe that something on site is doing something to an external entity. \n To give you some idea, we have site connected to a data centre via fibre and then from that data centre firewall out to the internet. \n I don't even know really where to begin with this, the only evidence of the issue is poor network performance, packets being dropped to servers in the DC and to the internet.

          "description": "I am aware that a network professional should plan a site and choose appliances and brands depending on several factors, such as:\n  \nReputation and Reliability: A brand with a good reputation for quality and reliability is likely to be preferred by a network engineer. This is because they need to ensure that the network is up and running smoothly at all times, and any downtime or failure could result in significant losses for the organization.\n Compatibility and Integration: A network engineer may choose a brand that integrates well with other devices already in use in the network. This can simplify network management and reduce the likelihood of compatibility issues.\n Features and Functionality: Different brands offer different features and functionality, and a network engineer may choose a brand based on the specific needs of their organization. For example, a brand that offers advanced security features may be preferred for a network that handles sensitive data.\n Cost: The cost of networking devices can vary significantly between brands, and a network engineer may need to balance the cost with the needs of the organization. In some cases, a more expensive brand may be preferred if it offers better performance or reliability, while in other cases, a more affordable brand may be preferred if cost is a primary concern.\n  \nHaving said so, for our next school site (900 users) we could opt to continue using Ubiquiti devices which have an overall good price to performance and reliability ratio. However, within the community, there are several experts who keep on snubbing Ubiquiti as if it were an unreliable or less-enterprise grade devices.\n Given the the above brands, and the above thoughts, if you were asked \"Ubiquiti, why yes and why no\", how would you reply?

The ASA 5515 is current NAT'd behind another firewall. Ports 4500, 500, and 50 are DNAT'd to the ASA. This is where my knowledge of networking starts to fizzle out as I believe a lot of the issues I am running into are because of NAT-T and potential limitations I might not know of or how to get around\n The NSX-V is connected directly with a public IP. I am connecting the on-site ASA to the cloud hosts NSX-V. In the snippets below the 216. is the NSX-V and the 10. is the ASA. All Phase 1 settings match and what is interesting is that if make a change to the tunnel on the NSX-V and save (like disabling and re-enabling PFS) the tunnel acts like it comes up on port 500.\n  6 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 302015 10.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 216.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 Built outbound UDP connection 9147 for Outbound:216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) to identity:10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) \n However after about ~30s I get this error and the tunnel continues to loop on port 4500\n 4 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 750003 Local:10.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Remote:216.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Username:216.xxx.xxx.xxx IKEv2 Negotiation aborted due to ERROR: Auth exchange failed \n I saw in this VMware article that states potential issues with NSX-T and IPsec with NAT-T. So I would assume that same behavior is to be expected with NSX-V. I configured the NSX-V to only be a IKE Responder so that only the ASA would initiate the tunnel but I havent seen any change in outcome. https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/77288\n As a test I tried to build a policy-based IPsec tunnel to a USG I get somewhat similar behavior where Phase 1 completed however after that the tunnel is torn down and the reason being User-Requested. \n Just a little stumped, if anyone wants to toss some knowledge into my beggars cup.

Mainly white box ones, being QuantaMesh and Arista the closest (EdgeCore models available are not ONIE compatible, so ...).\n So, for our case, based on price capabilities, we have the following models to be purchased :\n  \nArista 7050QX-32\n QuantaMesh T1048-LB9A\n Nexus 2048T\n Nexus 3000 (3048TP) and 5000 (5596T)\n  \nThe preference is for white box switches, and only Arista fits that requirement (we're evaluating SONiC and Stratum primarily).

          "description": "I'm working on a reorganization of a relatively small data center into something resembling a decently designed, modular network. It's of a size where it doesn't need anything more than a collapsed core with ToR switches acting as a access. It's going to be L2 access for now because of equipment availability. Also because of its small size, I'm not doing any overlay networking.\n However, some of the hosts are VMhosts like ESXi and it occurs to me that they have their, virtual switches internally. Other than providing basic VLAN infrastructure, they aren't doing anything in terms of service provisioning, port density is a nonsensical concept for a vSwitch, and any interconnect to physical switches is, at most, going to be doing basic trunking/tagging.\n So, how do these fit into the outline of the infrastructure? I'm trying to get this design to be scalable -- small right, but possible to grow and evolve without major rip and replace of the whole thing rather than piece by piece over the years -- and data center networking is something I'm not deeply familiar with. Do you just ignore their presence, beyond ensuring there is no possibility of them causing L2 issues?\n    submitted by    /u/Mexatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just want to know what type of wall would be the best substitute.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/technicalityNDBO  \n [link]   [comments]",

The rack consisted of multiple Aruba switches/controllers and Cisco router stacked on top of each other.\n My question is how would you go about moving all this equipment to another building?

I have a port forwarding rule on the Sonicwall to reach the Proxmox web UI from the internet on HTTPS/TCP port 8006. I have an SSL certificate installed on the Proxmox host for sub.domain.tld. This works perfectly.\n I am now trying to add more web servers to this subdomain on other ports, i.e. https://sub.domain.tld:8443 and http://sub.domain.tld My issue is that I get an ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED in my browser for any other port.\n My NAT configuration for the other two web servers that I'm trying to reach matches the NAT configuration for the working web server, the Proxmox host on https://sub.domain.tld:8006, except I created a service object entry for HTTPS/8443. That's the only difference. Still, I get ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED.\n I did a packet monitoring in the Sonicwall appliance to try to isolate the issue and I see the traffic is being dropped to the internal hosts using 80 and 8443, due to \"Error code 40 (Enforced firewall rule)\".\n There isn't any kind of p@cket trac3r or traffic simulator like ASA has so I'm kind of at a loss. There really aren't any other firewall policies set up since this is a really basic and new configuration, so I can't imagine there'd be anything conflicting.\n The reachable web server and the non-reachable web servers are in the same network zone as defined by the Sonicwall, so it shouldn't be an access issue either.\n I can reach the web servers both internally and on a separate network segment for VPN. \n I'm stumped, any ideas?

          "description": "Just thought I'd do a PSA for this in case anyone runs into this issue again. We had a request to make some NDI capable cameras work with OBS over our enterprise wireless (this particular SSID had to be created on our older Cisco 8510 due to the APs involved). The cameras themselves I believe are Mevo brand.\n After making some tweaks to get the cameras connected and accessible from the Mevo mobile app (client isolation was turned on in the WLAN config so easy fix), the next issue was that the devices were not being discovered as NDI camera sources in OBS. NDI uses mDNS but I was having issues finding the specific service string so we could add it to the mDNS snooping allow list. Ended up doing a packet capture to find it: \n _ndi._tcp.local.\n Simple enough but even searching this in Google now that I know the answer didn't bring in a lot of results so I wanted to post this and hopefully it is helpful to someone in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/Dotren  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a building with 5 stacks of Cisco C9200L switches. Across all of those I have one VLAN which is our AV VLAN with about 180 devices of various types of AV equipment from Teams Rooms to Dante microphones/speakers, amplifiers, control systems and Crestron NVX encoders/decoders. Everything works perfectly fine. \n I’m trying to add a new audio conferencing solution that needs to connect to some cameras using ONVIF for control. The main system sends out a discovery to the network to find any cameras. The cameras can also be manually added but then after populating the details it sends an ONVIF discovery probe to get all the details of the device. These processes don’t work at all on the AV network. If I change the addresses of these devices to any other subnet it works. \n My assumption is that there’s too much traffic flying around on that network and the messages are getting blocked somehow. I’m at a loss as to how to rectify it though. All the stacks have 10gig uplinks with no saturation, igmp snooping configured, igmp querier set to collapsed core Nexus. Any ideas what I might be missing?\n Edit: I got it. It was an issue with MTU and jumbo frames.\n    submitted by    /u/StuntedGorilla  \n [link]   [comments]",

This week, my main and only customer told me that they will no longer be requiring my services -- the (in)famous pink slip (or email, in this case).\n Won't get into too much detail in order to not breach the NDA, but it's one of the largest financial institutions in Europe. I was handling several DC's for them, and they decide they no longer need those DC/branch offices. They will be moving all their apps to the cloud, and all their personnel back to their HQ. They'll only have a skeleton crew at the locations which I manage, so that makes my role rather redundant. \n The reason I opened this thread is not to complain ( I'm single, no obligations, no rent, and I have several certs, including CCNP Enterprise and JNCIS-SP), but I'm curious what is the status of remote work where you're currently at ?\n This contract was 100% remote. Since I got the news this week, I think applied to some 200 jobs already, and while I found some very interesting ones which were a good fit, and which paid even better than my current contract. However all of them required either hybrid or on-site presence. \n Since the pandemic ended, what was the policy in your company in regards to remote/office hours ? And what do you think will be the future of remote work, especially for us ICT folks ? \n Also, if you happen to know anyone looking for a 100% remote based network engineer, don't hesitate to reach out to me in private.\n    submitted by    /u/WhatNot4271  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been experiencing a weird issue with my production dell L3 router S6000-ON. Once a week or soall of its port-channel members ungroup and then immediately group back up (I have lacp long-timeout set). I turned on RSTP and LACP debug events but it essentially just logs the fact that those ports ungrouped and not the reason why they did it in the first place. No alarms or other environmental thresholds were reached. I'm trying to find some kind of event or traffic burst in my network to explain these events but it is difficult. I'm trying to think of ideas of what I could check to figure this one out.\n I changed the firmware from the older to the latest but it didn't seem to have any effect.\n ​\n I noticed some possible causality on one of my access switches connected to the router. I was migrating my router from old hardware to new and the issue of port-channel flapping moved to the new after moving this particular access switch (although I can't be sure). I noticed that port-channel for that switch has counter for \"giants\", but I'm not sure if that can have any affect on the switch itself (giants = packets that are greater than the MTU size).\n    submitted by    /u/OzschmOz  \n [link]   [comments]",

The floors are largely open - no walls, just empty space. We do not have access to the building's internet and we may (or may not) have access to normal consumer-level electricity supply.\n It just needs to be be there for a couple of weeks. 50 wifi temperature sensors will beplaced on each floor and will connect to the wifi and transmit their small amount of temperature data to a cloud service.\n I'm thinking we will likely need three 4G mobile internet routers (one per floor) and then a wifi access point (or more than one) for each floor. And possibly a UPS for each floor to supply the power to them - although hoping that electricity will be possible.\n No floor-to-floor cabling will be allowed and only minimal, exposed cabling allowed on each floor.\n So I guess my questions are chiefly:\n  \nWill one WAP per floor be able to deal with 50 low-data devices and the 80mx50m area?\n If so (or if not) what devices would you recommend\n Anything else I ought to be thinking about?\n  \nThx\n    submitted by    /u/Codga69  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are a small ISP/MSP and our upstream provider told us that users from two of our /24 IP ranges send very excessive DNS queries asking for the IP address of a.root-servers.net (their engineer told me that there were times when it surpassed google by a significant margin, even distorting their statistics for site queries).\n Now I am wondering what could even cause this; especially as there is very little overlap in infrastructure between the two IP ranges (and one of the ranges have a significant infra overlap with other unafected ranges)?

I have learned to configure switches like Alcatel, HP, 3Com, Nortel, Dlink, Dell, Netgear on a basic level. Vlans, port isolation, loop protection, troubleshooting why it wouldn't work. We have only mikrotik dude to monitor entire network. We use only mikrotiks.What would be the best network monitoring software to monitor network for free? I can't take care of my network if I can't see what's going on in it properly. The dude only displays bandwith after 24hrs. Service up, down with notification to telegram is setup so we can react quickly. Zabbix + grafana, prometheus + grafana?How to take care of network properly? What to monitor? What are free gpon monitoring tools? Zabbix seem to increase cpu load of gpon. I have basic understanding but I want to get better and take care of my network. I have to take care of a few data rooms, switches, security, I need to see what's going on my network in switches, gpon, I want to get better at this.

Is this something on their end, or does this refer to our own hardware?

There is a second ISP that connects to the HA firewalls and the equipment from that ISP has multiple ports for WAN and a WAN switch isn't needed on the second ISP link.\n It is a 24 port switch and I plan on using interfaces 1-12 for the WAN VLAN (to avoid using VLAN 1 and all 24 ports). I've already added the WAN VLAN and added those ports to that VLAN.\n The mgmt interface will be used for local access/configuration.\n Here are my questions (so far).\n  \nI'm going to confirm LLDP isn't active on ports 1-12.\n I'd like to configure SNMP to only send data to my internal SNMP server. I've seen switches/network devices that have fields/commands to send SNMP data to specific servers, but I've also left those fields blank and I can still log into my NMS and pull SNMP data from the switch given I have the correct information.\n  \nI'm currently reading through the 3900 manual to confirm the LLDP and SNMP commands, but I wanted to see if anyone here had any other suggestions that I may be missing to avoid leaking out data/information that should be avoided on the WAN side.\n Traditionally we've never done anything fancy to WAN switches, they are just L2 switches that we throw into the mix and we've also never had any management other than a local console cable IF a change needed to be made. Going forward, I'd like to change this and given that I have a local network port for management, I'd like to secure this switch the best way that I can.\n The default credentials have already been changed.\n Thanks.\n Edit- In other switches I've used, the management port is usually listed as out of band. I haven't found that to be the case for this 3900 switch.\n    submitted by    /u/tdhuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I'm experimenting with a Juniper SRX and it seems static routing isn't as straight forward as it would be on a Cisco.\n I have my SRX connected to an L3 switch, with a network either side. On the L3 switch I've issued the static route command and set next hop as the Juniper interface that connects to the L3 switch.\n I added a static route in on the Juniper also, with next hop as L3 switch interface. However, when trying to ping from the Juniper network into the L3 network, my gateway comes back with destination net unreachable. In fact, when I logon to the Juniper over SSH, and try pinging the L3 switch interface, I get \"no route to host\" and when I look at the Juniper routing table, I see an entry for the L3 switch interface listed as a \"rejected\".\n I read somewhere that you can't simply add a static route onto a non point-to-point link on a Juniper. If that is the case, can someone explain how I can configure a basic static route on here?\n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/No_Barracuda_3615  \n [link]   [comments]",

My router that is redistributing BGP -> OSPF would be considered an ASBR. However, since I'm going from OSPF Area 0 to OSPF Area 1 in a VRF, does the VRF act as an ABR (and not an ASBR) thereby allowing the Stub area to receive the type 5 LSA?\n I understand the simple solution is to configure the Neighbor Router as a NSSA.

          "description": "Hi, I've been working on a project that involves taking the existing network of 192.168.1.0, splitting it up into VLANs and creating additional VLANs to allow for a Data Network and Voice Network. I have a Layer 3 core switch which is connected to an ASA and all of the VLANs are configured on the core switch. I implemented the design this weekend and am having trouble with the connections from the new VLANs to the pre-existing network.\n My configuration is as follows:\n ASA\n int g1/1 - Outside\n int g1/2 - Inside - 192.168.1.1 (Connected to Core Switch)\n route inside 192.168.101.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2\n route inside 192.168.102.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2\n route from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.2 is directly connected via g1/2 \n Core Switch\n vtp mode server\n int g1/0/1 (Connected to ASA)\n switchport access to vlan 10\n int vlan 10\n ip add 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0\n ip helper-address 192.168.1.30\n int vlan 80\n ip add 192.168.101.1 255.255.255.0\n ip helper-address 192.168.1.30\n int vlan 90\n ip add 192.168.102.1 255.255.255.0\n ip helper-address 192.168.1.30 \n ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 \n ip routing is enabled \n So here's what I've found so far:\n I can ping from 192.168.1.x to any other VLAN\n I can't ping the other way around\n DHCP is working. I'm able to receive all DHCP information and can reach the internet.\n I can ping all SVIs and ASA from 192.168.101.x\n I can't ping between 192.168.101.x and 192.168.102.x networks \n There are ACLs applied to the inside interface on the ASA, but they appear to permit all icmp traffic and all ip traffic.\n I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this exact issue as searching on Google has been no help. I mostly get results with configurations that involve using the ASA for Inter-VLAN networking, using sub-interfaces and whatnot. I am strictly trying to setup Inter-VLAN networking on the L3 switch. Any help would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/gigapet  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am trying to set up a complex system using a cisco nexus with full routing enabled. I need to have two VRFs set up for regulations requirements. I need to get 4 networks on the switch run through 2 vrfs out two physical interfaces up to the firewall where Policy can handle it and let things go out to the internet. I am having trouble actually configuring it.\n The basic set up is kind of like this: \n VR-Office\n vlan 12\n 10.10.12.0/22\n 10.10.12.1 gateway \n vlan 16\n 10.10.16.0/24\n 10.10.16.1 gateway\n int eth1/1 ip add 172.16.16.129 #the far end will have an add of 16.130 \n VR-Accounting\n vlan 112\n 10.20.12.0/22\n 10.20.12.1 gateway \n vlan116\n 10.20.16.0/24\n 10.20.16.1 gateway\n int eth1/2 ip add 172.16.16.133 #other side will have address 16.134 \n I need the two vlans to have an svi per vlan that I can add to the associated VRFs. Then I need to route to physical interfaces associated to the vrfs.\n The way I logically manage it in my head I imagine that the office vrf has two SVIs, one per vlan, with each having the IP address of the vlans gateway. Then the office vrf also has the physical interface. \n I want to make sure that the vlans 12 and 16 are only routing on vrf vr-office and can be routed our eth1/1 to get out. \n Am I misunderstanding anything? Would anyone be willing to explain how this might look in a L2/L3 router's config? I feel like I am missing something simple.\n    submitted by    /u/mustang23200  \n [link]   [comments]",

TLS certificates require domain names to work so DNS over TLS only works if you provide a hostname instead of an IP address, but if the device is connecting to a network for the first time and the DHCP server only provides the hostnames for the DNS servers then how is the device going to resolve the hostname to connect to the DNS server in the first place? Also, what if I'm connected to a single DNS server that supports DoT and the cached IP address disappears or something? How are these situations handled? And if you just cannot resolve any query then are you supposed to provide the IP address of the server as a fallback option?

So vlan default = vlan 1. Wouldn't each interface act the same with anything on vlan 1?\n The change I am making is swapping po1 and 2 vlans. So I don't know why when I move po1 (which owns the default, or vlan1 traffic) to po2, traffic stops flowing.

Anyone with a keen interest in learning automation can get to that point in no time at all.\n With that being said, I’d really appreciate some seasoned automation people to share cool ideas they’ve implemented. \n I was thinking of looking into how to create a web GUI that takes in a command and runs them against some specified devices. But then I think Ansible Tower is pretty similar to that, so I don’t think that would be the best return on time for me to create that (bearing in mind it’d take me a long time to learn how to create web GUIs).\n This post was borne out of a desire to understand how to get to the next level.

We peer with Lumens AS3356 and we peer with AltaFibers primary AS as well. \n The problem is that we peer with one of Spectrums regional ASs, 10796, vs their 'backbone' Charter AS7483. In this case, many would be preferred routes are now an additional AS away. \n Is it possible to strip AS10796 out of the routes which also have AS7483 so that I can install them with one less AS in the path?

Mostly for smaller scale government networks. I've made it to the final round of interviews for a position as an MPLS engineer.\n I feel confident about some of the things they want, like L2 switching, L3 routing, OSPF/BGP and Cisco familiarity. The problem is that I haven't touched MPLS professionally in a while, and when I did it was on the customer end. The company I'm interviewing with is a provider. Aside from a core understanding of MPLS, I've also been told they're going to want to talk about: Segment Routing, Pseudowire, VRF, VPRN, VPLS, EVPN, 1588, and TWAMP. They've also mentioned the ISIS routing protocol which I'm not too familiar with.\n I understand the theory of MPLS and I've been individually researching these other topics. I was wondering if you guys know any solid video series, courses/labs, or books that would cover most or all of these things under the MPLS umbrella. The interview is next week so my aim is not to sound like a complete clown when I talk about MPLS. Any advice appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/HaleMorne  \n [link]   [comments]",

We then used RSPAN get all traffic from all of the lower switches up to SW1 for the local SPAN. Currently SW6 and SW7 have remote VLAN 111 going to SW3. But once we try forwarding SW3 to SW1 using VLAN 111 it creates a loop and sends a copy back to SW6 and SW7 since the trunk allows the VLAN both ways.\n Any solutions to this issue?\n We are thinking of having RSPAN on SW4, 5, 6 and 7 use VLAN 111 and then configure RSPAN on SW2 and 3 to use VLAN 112 so that way the traffic is only able to go one direction.

          "description": "Hello, I am currently developing a multiplayer video game that will be using UDP P2P and I wish to use hole/nat punching to solve the issue with users not having to configure their router ports and/or network settings.\n I've managed to set up a system with a middle hand server that introduces users to each other (I believe it is called a STUN server?). Each user connects to this and a user (client) can request to be matched with another user (host). If a suitable host is found, the host is notified of the client and vice versa, they then start punching each other. This setup seems to work as intended, for most cases at least...\n The problem I am facing is in the case that the hosting user is on a non-public ip adress. The \"handshake\" via hole punching does not seem to get confirmed and the connection fails.\n Is there some kind of way to solve this issue? A relay server is not really part of the plan as it includes additional latency and costs.\n ​\n Edit: or could this issue not be related to the IP being private and instead be a router issue?\n    submitted by    /u/Fapstep  \n [link]   [comments]",

This VDC has L3 connectivity to the other VDC for the data center. \n A majority of L3 default gateways live at the distribution layer for the staff vdc and most L3 gateways for DC vlans live in the data center core.\n The team is being tasked with segmenting traffic.\n Would you all migrate L3 gateways to the PANs to zone them or would you VRF and leave the L3s where they are?

The only commonality between these ports are that they all have a USB-C style docking station attached to them with a laptop. Port-security is helping stop the mac-addresses from overloading, but I'm curious if anyone has ever ran into something like this?

          "description": "Hi, does the notes I've made below (along with the one question too) sound about right when describing active vs passive authentication? Let's assume the firewall I mentioned to is a Firepower device too (not that it would matter anyway)\n Active authentication actively prompts the user to sign in before they try and access a website and then after that it will go through the access policy to see if that user account matches any rules for that username for them to be able to access a particular website. You can specify what managed device (computer/vm) you want the user to see this authentication prompt on when they try and access the internet. When it says authentication method is HTTP basic, what does that mean? Does it mean that the device (firewall) will open a port 80 connection with the domain controller to check to see if the users entreded creds are correct and then authenticate the user? \n Passive authentication won't prompt the user when they're on a device and will instead check ISE (which is acting as the user agent) to tell ISE to go and check AD for the ip to user and group mappings for the account that is presented to ISE and then retrieves that info from the DC's and builds the connection logs out also uses that information to then go through the access policies and check to see if any rules are hit too \n These 2 authentication methods only work with 80/443 traffic\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

What configuration/technology should I look into to help me accomplish the redundant core switch?\n One option I have looked at include HSRP but that seems to be only for routers and not for SVI interfaces. I have also looked at VSS but I lack the hardware to test this feature.\n Link to my simple topology.\n    submitted by    /u/Neggly  \n [link]   [comments]",

And it has no problem in returning Ruckus VSA 142 that should contain a modified version of each PSK. The problem is in storing the PSKs.\n As per the Ruckus docoumentation for the DPSK format, Clearpass would have to be able to use one of the SHA1 key derivation functions and then store a byte array based on a combination of the SSID and the PSK. Let's assume the PSK is admin-assigned, not generated for each client by Clearpass. The natural place to store a DPSK would be a custom dictionary attribute in the Endpoints repository, however, these do not support byte arrays, nor do they provide any access to basic functions. In this case the required function is definitely available to the underlying system as Clearpass uses it for hashing admin user passwords. In any case since the DPSK format is zero-padded a string field cannot be used instead.\n Anyway, I figured it worth asking if anyone had found a solution.\n    submitted by    /u/perryurban  \n [link]   [comments]",

I came across fields that I want to extract which is easy. So my question is:\n 1) I cannot seem to find how to corrolate the port number to the mac address/IP address of the device. I was hoping someone may know? I tried doing Ctrl + F on ifIndex, IP, Mac Address and VLAN but couldn't find the corrolation.\n 2) Which OID should I use if I run this across chassis based switches aswell? Which will be most reliable to use? - ipNetToMediaIfIndex, ipNetToMediaPhysAddress, ipNetToMediaNetAddress or ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress?\n SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: DUMMY-SWITCH-NAME\n IF-MIB::ifName.1001 = STRING: 1/1/1\n IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaIfIndex.13600006.10.147.95.232 = INTEGER: 13600006\n IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaPhysAddress.13600006.10.147.95.232 = STRING: a2:ca:28:2b:d\n IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaNetAddress.13600006.10.147.95.232 = IpAddress: 10.147.95.232\n IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress.13600006.ipv4.\"10.147.95.232\" = STRING: a2:ca:28:2b:d\n IF-MIB::ifIndex.1001 = INTEGER: 1001\n IF-MIB::ifDescr.13600006 = STRING: VLAN-RANDOM\n IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus.1001 = INTEGER: up(1)\n IF-MIB::ifOperStatus.1001 = INTEGER: up(1)\n IF-MIB::ifDescr.1001 = STRING: Alcatel-Lucent OS6860 GNI 1/1/1 \n You may look above and say \"Well who uses Alcatel Lucent\", I say \"Dont worry, I ask myself the same question every day\".\n Also mac address above is random, so dont worry!

The firewall itself is a cisco asa 5506, I will be looking at ways to capture the traffic in these conditions, but thought I would ask here as well. \n The server in question does have an incoming ACL on port 443, it also has an outgoing ACL on port 443. \n The log entry is this; \n Feb 21 22:59:06 GMT/BST: %ASA-session-3-106100: access-list RS-DMZ_access_in denied tcp RS-DMZ/192.168.51.11(443) -> outside/x.x.x.x(57492) hit-cnt 1 first hit [0xdc286a6b, 0x00000000]\n ​\n The interesting thing to me is that is originating from port 443 and going to a random port externally. \n Could this be some kind of http keepalive or poll? \n We have had no reports from the operations team as to things not working, so I can only guess the impact of the block is nothing worth worrying about.\n    submitted by    /u/officedg  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just a duplicate IP address and Peer-Gateway.\n ​\n This is a long story, I'm not a fan of this since you can run HSRP on a private IP range and set a single IP from a public range as gateway for clients under the HSRP virtual IP but for some unknown reason my boss is pushing for the first option and I'm not sure what's going to break under such circumstances.\n ​\n Any input is appreciated I'm hoping to convince the boss to go for the sane method but need some better understanding first and demonstrate what negative effects it can have.

I have a Palo alto 450 connected to a Cisco 9200.\n Historically our core has been connected to a firewall via a Layer 3 connection with an IP address. 172.16.0.1(firewall) > 172.16.0.2 (Core). There are static routes on both devices that list those IPs as the next hops. \n I'm trying to get the VLAN information and routing up to the firewall, and in order to do that I need to make a trunk connection rather than an access connection. But trunk connections don't have layer 3 IP addresses, so if I convert my access connection to trunk, I'll lose my IP addresses. But then my static route won't know where to go. \n I'm sorry, I feel like I'm missing something very obvious here.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I am developing a product for multiple clients, and that product is going to be running on the cloud as a SaaS. The product focuses on analysing the client's private security cameras, so the idea is that the client simply puts the IP of the camera and my product starts picking up the feed. In these situations most of clients have their cameras in a private network and so just by having the IP won't do any good. What would the simplest way for the client to allow my product to have access to that private network so it can access the camera feed ? \n Thanks in advance ?\n    submitted by    /u/Deeks0  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a use case where a mobile router needs to be placed in a basement, approx. 10-15m away from a place with sufficient mobile signal. Is there an antenna with such cable length that would work? \n Router/antenna recommendations appreciated.\n I was also thinking about getting a rigid poe-powered 4G router (btw, 5G is not a must) and placing it where the signal is available. The place is a ventilation pipe, so withstanding weather of any season is necessary.

I have a few machines that each have IPs on my subnet for each application I'm running and a distribution layer switch. \n I want to use Bird for announcing my ASN and advertising my unicast subnet (potentially AnyTun package might be used for applications to have lower latency to Europe in the future) and if possible manage to implement /arouteserver for peering with cloud providers which I access frequently to lower IP transit costs. \n Since I have no upstream to filter traffic I would be verifying on my own and forwarding to my switch the traffic and letting it manage IPs to destinations to leverage its switching capacity for when my machines will intermingle with each others' applications instead of using up the capacity on my Linux entry and BGP machine. \n I apologize for my limited networking knowledge when it comes to design and architecture, but I have the feeling that a software based router would be the best in this scenario, if you guys have any advice for DPDK based open source projects I could leverage or implementing a firewall that could handle reasonable PPS with efficiency on a 2x40Gb/s NIC and 7950x consumer high IPC processor I would be grateful and massively appreciative.\n    submitted by    /u/myselfesteemrocks  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "These things are driving me nuts. I inherited a shit show. No professional site survey before AP deployment. Have multiple zones, that my predecessor installed where apparently one new AP can do the coverage of two old APs. Laptops and mobile work stations do fine with roaming and connectivity. Using Ascom i63 phones with Ruckus R730s, SmartZone as the controller. Phones are on 5Ghz band. Phones register with the pbx. User complaints are poor roaming and \"ghost calls\" where the phones will ring to a bridged extension but I assume packets arrive late due to high latency (they rarely go over 50ms on the AP) and the phone rings but caller not on the other end.\n Followed the interrop report from Ruckus/Ascom to set up the WLAN. The client settings and WLAN are exactly like the interop report. Doing wireshark traces does not reveal the problem. Did several Ascom log traces and when I caught the problem, notify Ascom and apparenly we do not have some super duper special docking station which allows me to view the log file. Absolutely livid about that. Getting no real help from Ascom other than they want more Omnipeek traces. \n I have been concentrating on one zone at a time. I got them to work better in two zones just by moving the APs further away from each other or deleting one or two. I do my own Netspot surveys and do not find coverage to be the issue. I am thinking more that co channel interference is the big issue here however neither company can point out exactly what the issue is. Does anyone have experience with this?
