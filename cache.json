The ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts configuration files on ESXi servers, potentially rendering virtual machines (VMs) unusable. \nCISA has released an ESXiArgs recovery script at github.com/cisagov/ESXiArgs-Recover. Organizations that have fallen victim to ESXiArgs ransomware can use this script to attempt …",

In October 2022, CISA identified a widespread cyber campaign involving the malicious use of legitimate RMM software. Specifically, cyber criminal actors sent phishing emails that led to the download of legitimate RMM software—ScreenConnect (now ConnectWise Control) and AnyDesk—which the actors used in a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts.\nAlthough this …",

I'm in the UK so of course the conversion rate plays a increasingly smaller factor in that, but I earn nowhere near that.\n It's highly likely that these sys admins do a lot more than me, but it got me thinking... What do you sys admins actually do in a fairly regular day to day? I'm hoping it might give me some ideas of what I want to do/what to expect as I further my career.

The apparent reasoning behind this is to allow anyone to access every conversation with clients should one of them be out of the office.\n Good Idea, bad execution they think mail storage is unlimited, and they don't want to delete old mails \"in case\", for now I set up an automatic archive but it's really slow and they've been complaining for a few days, some have the same problem on their own adresses. They're moving the mails manually from Inbox to the archive but that's just delaying the inevitable because the archive has a 50Gb max capacity.\n How can I solve this ?

          "description": "Hello There. I have a client that i have never worked with before that has asked me to advise them on modernising their IdP. They currently have a combination of Active Directory, synching to AzureAD, but using ADFS for Auth. In addition to using ADFS for 365 authentication, they are also using several other applications (box.com for example) as well as using LDAP against the on-prem for some on-prem apps.\n They are eager to move to AzureAD (or another cloud IdP) to remove dependency on On-Prem.\n My thinking is that each app that uses ADFS is going to be handled differently. And that each one needs to be \"cutover\", there is unlikely to be any way to stage or transition from one Identity source to another.\n For 365 and Sharepoint and other MS Apps, i plan to recommend using Staged Mode, as they have some automation and workflows that have the expected ADFS webpage hard coded into their authentication, so i will leave the identitites used there in ADFS until they are \"dev'd\" out.\n Staging mode should in no way affect the third party apps, am i correct?\n My method is along the lines of \n Enable PHS in ADConnect & Seamless SSO -> Enable Staging Mode -> Migrate majority of Human Users to Staging Group (I can move the Automation Accounts as their devs update the app to support this)\n The above has no impact on the 3rd party apps, correct?\n But what about if/when i change my domain in AzureAD away from Federated to Managed? Does that impact?\n Ive been doing a lot of reading, and seen plenty of people say that they read too much into this, it ended up not being as complicated as expected.

          "description": "I am considering methods to connect remotely to my iMac across the internet from an iPad Pro. Ideally I will avoid services that enable the connection via an unrestricted server (udp holepunch) even when the service is advertised as encrypted (so teamviewer, jump and even vpns are excluded).\n I prefer direct connections (ssh for terminal access and rdp for the windows but don't like the risk associated with port forwarding. My solution is to implement tcp wrapper on the server and either restrict the client access to the smallest range of IP addresses from whichever location I am at or each time I connect, restrict the IP address to my actual IP address at the time. To configure the tcp wrapper I would connect to the server using jump and then once I have configured it take down that connection and then come in directly using rdp and ssh (with access restricted to my remote IP address only). The jump “daemon” will run for 5 minutes periodically (say, once or twice an hour) so the jump connection will only be available within that window.\n In summary use the udp holepunch style services (jump, Team viewer, vpn) as a way of initialising the direct connection and as a backdoor route if I manage to lock myself out but do 99% of my connectivity directly. If I am able to restrict access to just the range of IP addresses used by whatever ISP I am coming in from, I might only have to configure tcp_wrapper once for each ISP from which I am connecting. If that isn't viable, I am cool with re-initialising each time my remote IP changes.\n I should add that all my important passwords are 16 chars in length and all have lower case, upper case, numbers and special chars so I feel fairly protected against brute force attacks.\n what do you think of this plan?\n thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/macseguro  \n [link]   [comments]",

No admin status, back to 'do what you're told' development.\n One year ago I wasted most of my time teaching other teams the basics of Agile, AD, business analysis, and got told I couldn't speak to other admins over Windows and Websphere and Salesforce because 'I caused more trouble by sharing information.' They replaced our business analysts and PMs with 'product owners' they scrounged from other departments and forced into roles they don't understand, and told us not to talk to the business or face consequences.\n Five months ago I interviewed for an asset manager position for $20k more in an entirely different department, got an instant offer, and my C-Level immediately calls to offer me the same pay scale and the long-promised lead position a day later, provided they put the job up for anyone to apply to. I explained I had an outside offer for double what I was just offered (but with way fewer benefits and leeway).\n I played hardball in 2022-2023, management got scared about losing me, and I finally got the job.\n    submitted by    /u/fluffy_warthog10  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've looked over the documentation and the overall setup/etc doesn't look too bad and we will run this through lab/pilot groups of course. \n My questions is, is there any downside to predeploying the laps client (prior to schema changes/etc)? Getting the client out is easy enough (deployment solution)... but like everywhere else in the last two years our workforce has scattered across the country lol. The deployment could take a week or two to complete and for some units we may want to be a bit more aggressive on the timeline to rollout.\n Also, any thoughts on this being deployed for servers? Again... this seems pretty strait forward assuming avoiding things like domain controllers/etc. Any other big gotchas we should be looking for/might see?\n Should have added...most of our environments are fairly simple domains but some are wide spread.

          "description": "A few days ago the wall mounted AC unit in the server room was making a clunking sound once in a while. I checked it out and it was just the lifters on the oscillating vent, but since we don't have a service contract on it and we've been in budget crunch for a few months now I just put off looking at it for another day.\n Came in this morning and the clunking sound is gone. So - as of this moment, the AC unit is both working (\"alive\") AND not working (\"dead\") until of course I open the door. Logically speaking I don't need to look at it - right? LOL.\n All kidding aside, the iDRAC controllers on the Dell r730xd's haven't thrown a temperature error /yet/ so I know it's still working. However, I know they're going to ask me to McGyver the hell out of that unit.\n    submitted by    /u/clilush  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can find plenty of pros and cons online about the general features and performance of each platform but I have a very specific concern about this potential switch over and that is the control and admin of the cloud recordings, let me explain.\n Zoom has a wonderful admin interface that allows us to see all cloud recordings in one place, this is used mainly in our Sales department. It is especially helpful when a user leaves the business, we are able to transfer all their Zoom cloud recordings to their line manager as we delete their Zoom account with ease.\n Google Meet seems to have a very bare bones approach to Meeting recordings. By default it will just save a recording to the meeting hosts Gdrive and that's it, no option to transfer to another user (i.e their manager) and no centralised control over these recordings.\n ​\n Am I totally seeing this wrong or is Zoom the clear winner in recording management with the meetings and calls?\n    submitted by    /u/Helpdesk_Peon  \n [link]   [comments]",

Alas, still have the issue.\n ​\n We originally thought it was a Meraki switch that was causing routing issues, but it has been disconnected and the problem still remains.\n ​\n the DC with the issue seems to behave differently to the other DC as well, If I ping the DC hostname from the DC it will return ::1 where as the second DC responds with the correct v4 address. A bit of a google has suggested changing ipv4 preference over IPv6, but not sure if this is going to make much of a difference. waiting on a good time to reboot the server for the regkey to take effect.\n ​\n It could be the firewall, though I cant see anything in the logs for any DNS requests that are being denied.\n ​\n any suggestions on what the issue might be or where you might look next?\n    submitted by    /u/bobmanuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

That part is clear. \n But who decides the actual point in time when the switchover from old to new occurs ? AS2 uses a 1:N relation, you have 1 private key for n partner relations, so switchover should be done in concert.\n But looking at my AS2 server (mendelson) it appears not to \"try\" to use its new key when a partner sends a file using our new public key. It knows both its old and new keys.\n Is this some RFC all AS2 implementation suffer from or just un-user-friendly implementation ?\n I have a hard time believing I have to send a precise date/time to all my AS2 partners to make switchover successfull ?\n ​\n thanks\n    submitted by    /u/unannunciated  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just called our printer vendor, asked for direct replacement as I don't know too much about this I relied on their knowledge but I am starting to think it was a mistake, not sure still, maybe you guys can help.\n So issue is the printouts are smaller. They are good quality, not cropped, just downsized ~30% centered in the middle. This is a packing station, we print over network directly from SAP spooler, labels are .pdf.\n I tried everything humanly possible from direct import of the config file from other zebras to side by side going through both internal config utility and ZSU, gave it an hour or two of tinkering and then gave up (ultimately, barcode so it's usable it just looks funny and bit hard to read).\n So the main difference what I found was printer resolution. Old was 203dpi, new is 300dpi. I couldnt find any up/downscaling settings in neither of setup utilities.\n Is dpi the problem here and if so, is there any trick to upscale printouts with zebra label printers?\n    submitted by    /u/hegysk  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is for a future production environment. I am taking the sysadmin role in a small company and I originally learned computer sciences with a focus on application development, so while I know the basics I am missing a lot of experience with implementing servers. \n What I want to do:\n I'll have a central Ubuntu server that runs as a NAS and possibly run VMs for workloads (simulations, renders and a database). I need to manage permissions for user groups and individual users. I also want access via VPN for homeoffice users and would like to manage a universal login for every user (would be perfect to be able to import these) and not have several logins. \n I am aware of Windows Active Directory but since I decided not to bother with Windows as my server OS (mainly because of licensing and compatible database software) I want to do that on a Linux Server. \n Basically I want to manage access so that only specific groups of users or specific users can access certain folders, thats the most important thing right now. There are aproximately 30 users but the number will grow in the future. Clients are all using Windows and if I could use the windows login as authentication for server access that would be perfect.\n Its my first time planning a complex server setup from scratch with user management, but I want it to be well plannned and documented, so any help and advice would be appreciated. I am open to suggestions about the general server or network architecture and the software I'll use, but my Hardware needs to at least host a NAS, a DBMS and ideally a VM.\n Please let me know if anny more information is necessary and thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/tho3maxi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Patches and backups are automated, you rarely need to be there after hours, etc. So overall, maybe it isn’t on fire?\n Either way I received notice that I was not selected, maybe since I was firm with my asking amount. All for the best, I suppose, since I found out the IT guy is related to the owner, after reading about some of their current and past lawsuits online…also, they asked several times if I was currently employed, which is obvious that I am, and that seemed like a red flag to me.\n Stay picky out there!\n    submitted by    /u/ramm_stein  \n [link]   [comments]",

We hired someone from out of state who has previously worked as IT director for a company about 5x our size. We are a medium sized company with about 5,000 employees worldwide. Up until recently everything has been business as usual with no significant changes. \n Today I heard that a company called TCS will start supplementing our work to help complete projects and handle day-to-day support. It was explained to us that this will allow us to drive more strategic concepts and leave support. \n My boss scheduled a meeting with me for next week to go over the SOW and the SOW was attached to the meeting. I looked it over and it consists of several different areas (servers, databases, VMWare). These are my key competencies. \n TCS is quoting a yearly cost that is half of my salary.\n I asked my boss why my areas of expertise are subject and it was simply reiterated that I should focus on strategic work and let TCS handle the daily and we will talk more in the meeting next week.\n I feel like I may be in the chopping block but maybe I’m looking into it.

Anyway I have a pretty serious problem I think and would def appreciate some advice. \n So the company I’m working for conducts certification training and has 100 or so workstations (split between 15 corporate employees and 85 student computers). Every computer has windows 10 enterprise installed but I have no clue where the licensing information is. The computers are also so old there’s no original license key burned into the motherboard. The admin who set this all up died and his replacement was clueless. When a computer needed to be reimaged he used keys from visual studio :( (all I can do is put a sad face here). \n So here’s my question, am I right to assume that I would need to contact a license broker and purchase a windows 10 pro volume OEM license? Does anyone have any idea how much that might cost for 100 computers? \n Also, I think enterprise would be better for the corporate employees. We already have E3 licenses and are a silver partner with Microsoft. Once there’s a legit windows installation and the machine is added in azure I think that would check that block, but would there be any reason to also upgrade student computer from pro to enterprise (I don’t think so)?\n    submitted by    /u/hihcadore  \n [link]   [comments]",

The company is also trying to hire additional employees and I think it may be important to get another IT person soon. So all in all I do see a ticket system as an improvement.\n The problem is that my boss or anyone else in this company doesn’t know anything about IT and he doesn’t understand that I’m doing more than just fixing the users outlook problems because he just sees everything running fine and doesn’t know what goes into that. Because of that I fear that him seeing only a few support tickets coming in per day will lead him to believe that I don’t work enough. In reality I’m both trying to fix everything my predecessor implemented badly and without any documentation while keeping everything running and researching into improvements. But that can’t be put into tickets he can track.\n Would you recommend a full ticket system like Freshdesk in this situation?

Whole layout and functionality is different. And boy do they know how to screw things up. \n Like the multimedia macro? Tough luck. It's been removed from cloud. So if you, say, migrate a server site with videos to the cloud all your multimedia macros are broken. Ok, so how do you link the uploaded video on the page back to the page? See, if you had the multimedia macro you'd just put the macro on the page and select the video. \n Well, what you do is you download the videos to your hard drive and then drag and drop them back to the site and then delete the duplicate videos that are now attached.\n Seriously? Did I get this wrong or is this the official answer coming from support? \n Official answer. There's two feature requests related to fixing this feature gap, one is from 2018 and the other from 2019. \n And that's how it goes. Plenty of feature requests out there and if you think anything's going to happen on them then I've got swampland in Florida to sell you. \n This is an incredibly frustrating trend in software these days.

Simply, the company was sold by the owner to some employees, and ultimately the employees felt like I wasn’t the right fit to continue to manage the technology and systems there. Now that a year has passed I wanted to share some lessons and hope for the next person that has to live through something similar. First lesson, from before the firing, if you hear anything rumors or mentions that the company talked to someone about replacing you…rest assured it’s happening.

My previous role nearly reached the same point, but I left before I got to that.\n It's been brewing in me for some months now, managed to get a pay rise in the summer (but IT pay in the UK is dogshit anyway). The userbase we support is increasing, but we're horrendously understaffed, no time to research new technologies, we're locked in with garbage fucking systems because somehow it's not our decision. Somehow spend more time doing what should be a dedicated first line support's job, instead of doing actual system infrastructure maintenance. Sales guy is letting small clients set up BYOD systems and then trying to impose lockdowns on their personal devices, including using Intune/Endpoint Manager with a bunch of fucking Macbooks, then coming to me for help (spoiler: I can't)\n But yesterday, I had the full blown meltdown. Simple task, user needs printer/scanner installing. It's an older HP so probably won't be too much of a bastard to sort. Log on, no admin access for some reason, looks like Intune hadn't been applying the settings, and of course, Intune gives 0 useful information as to why. So it's possible the user is still an admin. Try to get him to elevate, he's not doing it and keeps cancelling, then he brings up HP Smart and disappears for 20 minutes and I get disconnected. Later get an email saying \"all working, thanks\"\n Just lost it. Why is such a simple task such a twat to do? Why is our IT structure so broken?\n Good people to work for, just not a good company\n Had an interview today, big pay rise, decent looking company.

At the time, I told them such and normally my opinions have weight, but this time I was outnumbered and they were locked in. Another in my cohort at this meeting, we will call him Mr. Z, is the kind of person who gleefully runs and does whatever upper management asks. He was as much for it as I was against it. So this thing got legs and ran.\n It's my role to sell some of these upper management decisions to the group, and do what was needed to make them successful. This time that wasn't possible. It was too draconian. It directly impacted people and their time. All I could do was offer some help. But I presented it as neutrally as possible so as not to throw anyone under the bus because it's just never good to openly do so. As a result they thought I initiated it, which normally I live with but this time was different.\n When the complaints from the field started coming in, people didn't want to say anything to me directly so they went to Mr. Z much to my surprise. Mr. Z then didn't own up to the fact that he was a big part of why this idea went forward. He just quietly listened, sympathized, and then went about his day. I know this because I overheard one of these conversations.\n At that point I called a WebEx with everyone in the field, apologized for the nightmare and the impact it had, and gathered data with all of their feedback on the recent issue. Everyone was 100% against it and all of the suggestions to fix it aligned. I then presented that data to upper management and requested to make modifications to the idea so it could work. It was more work to fix it but it needed to be fixed with urgency.\n This crisis was averted, but it cost valuable time and had an impact on my street cred.

          "description": "Previous thread\n When last I posted here on the topic, prior to the Christmas break, I was being pressured into shunting all of my IT stuff into a broom closet. My direct supervisor is the 2nd in command for the whole school system, and he became more and more furious over this request as I brought it up to him over our break. He clearly is on my side in this, which means case closed, it's not happening. \n I've chatted up the admin at the high school since on numerous occasions, and it has never once come up in conversation. Having 6 carts full of laptops charging in the room every day has helped, as there would be no space at all for this stuff. Between that, a laminator, a sound system for our gym, and countless spare machines, it would be impossible to fit all that stuff into their proposed \"space\", never mind trying to cram a pair of bodies in there with our desks to boot. \n All in all, I wanted to update everyone to let you all know that it worked, and that I am still master of my domain (puns for days). I know my employees appreciate my hard line I took in this matter, but I also wanted to thank all of you for supporting my choices in this matter. It's one of my highest rated posts on here, and I got a lot of great feedback from members of this sub. IT people deserve better than the crap we get from most people, and all the IT folks I talk to, even in conversations today, agree with me. We are not often treated with respect and dignity, but I'm not going to let that happen on my watch, with my staff, for as long as I am employed here. \n So thanks again, and feel free to comment or message me any questions you might have about working on a First Nations reserve, or in a FN school. I know my living and working situation is unique, so don't be shy.\n    submitted by    /u/Mikash33  \n [link]   [comments]",

He sends the mail to our client.\n However, now the mail he has send is showing up in the shared mailbox sent items. Every user can now read the mail in send items. It shows the personal from adres from our user. For me this is 100% reproducible, as i take the same steps. I would expect the reciever to get the mail as send on behalf of the shared mailbox, but to the reciever it shows as a mail recieved by the personal mailbox. The header of the mail also has no sign what so ever from the shared mailbox. \n Now this is kinda a red flag, as this would mean that user in our organisation might think he is typing a private message to someone else, only to show up in the sent items of the shared mailbox..\n What am I missing?

Add this node to the cluster and run it in Mixed-OS mode. Then do the same on the other node and lastly run \"Update-ClusterFunctionalLevel\". \n But is that really the most efficient way to do it?\n In the first linked article \"Upgrading Failover Clusters on the same hardware\" in the overview part it is written:\n  \nUpgrading the operating system on an existing failover cluster is only supported when going from Windows Server 2016 to Windows 2019.

Obviously this isn't sustainable.\n I'm not adverse to buying new software for this, however I generally am not a fan of niche software that isn't integrated with the rest of our systems.\n An ideal system would allow for certain people to update policies, but most (or all) employees being able to see the policies. It must either integrate with M365 or just be a solution native to the platform. Ideally folks would be able to track changes to the policy with different versions to see what's changed, and maybe get an alert when there is a new or updated policy.\n I figure I could do most of this with SharePoint but feels like I'd be building a lot of it from scratch. Any thoughts on what works well for you? I assume there are a lot of people frustrated by this and a lot of people thinking to themselves, \"If I could build this all over again I'd do it this way....\" so come at me!\n    submitted by    /u/poindexter62  \n [link]   [comments]",

I remoted in and checked vsphere and sure enough, one of the three hosts at that site had a connection state issue. I acknowledged the alarm and checked the VPN circuit. It was pegged out (some type of NAS backup was running, this is not unusual). I cancelled the backup and the circuit went back to a normal state.\n I was thinking that host 1 would come back but it never did. I tried signing into ESXi through the web interface for the host, but the connection would time out on the page after putting in my credentials and hitting login. Tried SSH and I would get a connection refused. Logged in through iDRAC, rebooted the host. It came up without issue.\n So then, this happens on another host, we will call it host 2. Same deal, same site. I also cannot log into ESXi. I ended up getting into the iDRAC and rebooting the host. When it came up, it resynced and all was well. \n FAST FORWARD AN HOUR LATER.\n I get an alarm that the third host is down and that an HA Event had failed. I logged in, one of my datastores is inaccessible and the third host is now down. This one, I cannot even get into the iDRAC, web interface or SSH.\n I got someone that was near the site to go and reboot the host manually from the rack, it came back up without issue. As for the datastore, I went into the connection & multipathing screen and had to manually mount it back to the first 2 hosts that we rebooted.\n All is back up and no alarms. I had generated support bundles to have VMWare check on this monday. Wow what a Saturday.\n    submitted by    /u/Weak-Peak1015  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I was just offered another role through a different company, fully remote sysadmin for about $85,000/yr. \n My questions are mainly... based on anyone else's experience in sysadmin work in the Midwest, should I try to aim for closer to $90k based on my experience? \n Should I just shut up and take the money?? Or should I aim higher for somewhere between $90k-$100k?\n (This is my first time specifically doing work with a \"sysadmin\" title, but been performing the same work through other roles I've held in recent years)\n I've looked up some Glassdoor avg salaries for the title but it was a pretty wide range, something like 55k-120k/yr?\n If anyone can help me out with this I'd really appreciate it as I'm trying to pursue making a big change in my life and move towards settling down and building a family with my fiancee.

          "description": "I need to set up a lab environment for my project, which supports a decade-old legacy system. The objective is to create corresponding setup guides and compile the necessary lab setup resources together for the team's future use. Our repository hasn't been updated since the system's deployment. Right now, I'm working on the setup of a particular server in the lab, which was only introduced during the system's mid-life upgrade. As such, there were no setup documentation for it and I had to reverse engineer the existing server to make guides for it from scratch.\n One of the software deployed in the system is SharePoint Portal Server 2003. It took me a while to realise that the version deployed in production is updated to Service Pack 3, but I only have the base version's installer. I searched high and low and haven't been able to find the SP3 installer anywhere in my office's repositories. The official download link from Microsoft is dead too.\n Does anyone know where I can get this file (likely named SPS2003SP3-kb923644-fullfile-ENU.exe - KB923644), or where I can go to ask?

Earlier this week at my workplace I had a iSCSI target from a Synology RackStation RS3614xs+ NAS (DSM 6.2.2-24922) suddenly disconnect overnight on a Windows Server. When I started investigating after noticing the issue, DSM tells me in the storage manager that \"There is no volume in your system\". 12-disk RAID6 is fine, alive and healthy, S.M.A.R.T. of all disks displays a \"Normal/Healthy\" status so nothing to worry about I think (only 1 disk mentioned 1 bad sector at the time after the sudden target disconnect). Storage pool is also operating normally from what DSM shows.\n I can still access the target, the data is still there but this volume \"missing\" in DSM is getting me a little worried.\n Every other RackStation NAS (configured with iSCSI/LUNs) we have currently running and everything I see on the web says that on a Synology NAS a LUN is located on a volume (like Volume 1) and not straight on a storage pool.\n I'm no expert in storage topics and still learning but everything I see in my investigation of the issue points in the direction that this is not a normal behavior. I searched on the web for a similar experience and cannot find cases where LUNs point straight to storage pool location instead of like an ext4 volume for example.\n What are your thoughts about this?\n Please let me know if additional context and details (even logs or output of CLI commands) are needed.\n Thanks in advance for your insight, and have a nice day!\n    submitted by    /u/gtkshroom  \n [link]   [comments]",

This one is partly a rant, but also partly a call for help.\n This is about an argument I had with my colleague. I don't know where he comes up with such ideas.\n We tasked to conceptualize a new ip address concept for our location. We have 200-250 employees, everyone with notebooks and smartphones. In total we come up with 500~ unique ip addresses.\n We don't expect to grow much, because we are limited by the size of our offices.\n We have 3 buildings, each with 3 floors. I rather expect, that we will build smaller branched offices in the future, if we ever fill up our current location.\n Thats all fine. Basic stuff. Thats like the 1,2,3 of a sysadmin. I did stuff like that in school and got tasks like this even as an exam …",

Which do you recommend? Where possible free.\n A software for remote access to the terminals. I currently use TeamViewer. I was looking at Radmin, maybe TW will change it to Radmin. What do you think? I like the Radmin interface better and how little intrusive it is.\n \nA software to monitor the network. Here I am adrift, any recommendations or advice? The network consists of a Mikrotik Router, a main non-manageable Switch and then an access Switch per floor that distributes to the terminals via UTP Cat5e. \n \nAny other point that they consider necessary to implement...\n A simple network schematic...\n \n What I appreciate most are the advice or experiences.

I've tried the usual UWP kiosk powershell in Windows but Spotify is strange in that it appears it is now an plug-in for the xbox game bar UWP app. It can't be found in the GUI to set up a kiosk app, and if you try to run SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Spotify it just gets stuck in a loop until I remote powershell in and remove the kiosk setting. If you use SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Widget it displays \"We weren't able to start your app.\" and an error code which indicates an operation was not supported.\n I've considered Edge fullscreen but the web-based can only cast to Spotify Connect devices they've previously registered and as this is at a school, giving access to an unauthenticated web browser is something I'd rather avoid.\n Another potential is BlissOS (Androidx86) but then I need to put in time to get that working with an MDM if it is even possible.\n If I can get it working, I'll design a secure-ish wall mount and 3D print as many as needed. (we have 30 of them) I was also considering using them for control panels for certain building automations (is there a more commercial focused option like homeassistant?) and also for using with Xibo for digital signage.\n Background: I'm the solo IT person for a special school, always looking for cheaper ways of doing things which make these kids' lives a bit better.

Its one of those things that happen in IT where if I were to tell someone they would instantly think it was bs. And in the moment you don't quite believe whats happening yourself.\n So, this school they have a 40mbps VDSL line. As you can imagine with over 200 devices on the network at times this is pretty slow. Today the download speed was 0.4 mbps with a 800ms ping. How they survive on this I will never know. I'm constantly trying to get them to upgrade to fibre but they just do not have the budget to do that. There network equipment is a mess too, they have a Dell Sonicwall router about 12 year old and Cisco switches from about 10 years ago. They recently upgraded a couple of switches to unifi and how have unifi ac pro access points.\n ​\n Today I was going round seeing if anyone had any issues in their classrooms and a staff member approached me asking why they had been asked to turn off ALL devices in their class. I walked around and everybody was turning all their devices off, it felt like apocalypse scene in a movie. The person who told them to turn everything off I went and asked her why this had happened and her response was \"I needed to download a large file and the internet is too slow\". I couldn't stop laughing. I had never heard of anything so outrageous in my life. The funny thing was, 75% devices dropped off the network and the speed was 2mbps download. \n ​\n Its so hard working with schools to improve their tech when they quite literally don't have the budget to upgrade stuff. They upgraded their servers a couple years ago but that was because they literally failed constantly.\n ​\n Thought this story was too funny not to share.\n    submitted by    /u/aaronf151  \n [link]   [comments]",

TLS 1.2 was not working as we wanted it to after 22H2. \n  \nOpen Registry Editor\n Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\RasMan\\PPP\\EAP\\13\n Create DWORD key TlsVersion value FC0\n Gpupdate /force\n reboot\n  \nDone\n ​\n Weird problem.\n We have a couple users who snuck in and updated their machines to Windows 11 before we locked that down. We also have a group policy that we designed for Windows 10 that deploys the info for all the SSIDs across all offices to all computers. It is set to reach out to RADIUS to verify ID, so users never have to log in.\n This GPO works great on all Windows 10 machines, and according to our other SysAdmin, it worked fine for 11 until 22H2 dropped. Now, users see the network that was pushed by GPO, but it tells them they \"Can't connect to this network\".\n I can log in to one of the Win11 machines and manually tell it to get on the \"Hidden Network\" and give it all the info, and that manually configured one works fine.\n If I check the GPO on the Win11 machine, Computer Configuration>Windows Settings>Security Settings>Wireless Network (IEEE 802.11) Policies and open the policy we created, then open the properties of the network, then go to the Security tab. I verify that it is using Secured Password (EAP-MSCHAP v2) as the Authentication Method and click Configure, but the EAP MSCHAPv2 properties window that pops up has the \"When connecting: Automatically use my Windows logon name and password (and domain if any) box unchecked and is greyed out. On the Win10 machines, though, that is checked.\n Given that, I'm assuming that the reason they can't connect is due to the Windows logon name and password not being pushed. Just not sure why the GPO isn't configuring that correctly in Windows 11.\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/swingkatd  \n [link]   [comments]",

The company I work at has been very stable, work life balance is excellent with typically no more then 40 hours per week, remote 4 days per week, have 6 weeks of vacation, and the other benefits (7% 401k matching, health care is under $200 a month for a family, bonus is usually around $7k) are good as well.

          "description": "Hello fellow sysadmins, I need to run a sanity check hope you can shed some light.\n I've inherited an environment, I'm still discovering and learning about it. It's an on-prem bare-metal/VMware, public cloud is minimal and completely independant. One concern that I have is that I'm seen some odd DHCP reservations for productions servers.\n To give an idea, I've seen DHCP reservation for MS-SQL database server, Domain controllers (all of them), Application Servers, anything that seems to be a production server where many people connect to, it is likely to have a reservation.\n Then in some cases, not all of them, the server has a static IP address assigned, despite of having a reservation. And you probably guess it, the IP address statically assigned to that server is in the DHCP range where other Desktop computers are also connected. This causes that the DHCP report the reservation as inactive.\n From the other side of the fence the monitoring system which is simple doing ICMP every once in awhile detects that host is down. There are no connectivity problems in some occasions when I manually check.\n In some other instances the ESXi web UI is inaccessible, I've experienced myself a duplicate IP caused by one of my computers that took the exact reserved IP address which belongs to that ESXi.\n My question is simple. Is this a normal practice to heavily rely on DHCP reservations to manage mission critical servers IP addressing? My personal bias to decimate that configuration. Go back to traditional static IP addressing, pushing the DHCP range to leave room for server addressing.\n On what scenarios a DHCP reservation would make sense to keep when dealing with servers that run network services that should be available to employees.\n    submitted by    /u/Proper-Obligation-97  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mainly around Teams setup as each site will likely be Teams enabled.\n I understand there are varying degrees of complexity depending on depth of Teams integration but have narrowed it down to 3 options.\n  \nSetup each department with their own site and dump folders alongside General. No private channels at this stage but, if setup down the line, there'll be nothing in General for users who are added (I understand the new Shared Channel option fixes this but seems fine to just keep everything alongside General anyway. Users can't delete the General folder but can delete the contents).\n Setup one site and create Private channels for the various departments. Easier to manage from a permissions standpoint as we can delegate channel owners to add and remove members. Downside is limit on number of private channels per team (will probably be under that though). I can map private channels to File Explorer but the name doubles-up (can fix this by customising the desktop.ini file).\n Let SharePoint migration tool dump everything to one site and call it a day. Deal with permission changes as needed.\n  \nAlso keen on references to other guides or scripts for checking file conflicts outside of the SharePoint migration tool. Been trying to research best practices for a while but the info keeps changing since the platform keeps evolving. Also saw a guide about using metadata rather than folders so they're accessible from more than one location but that seems like even more work/complexity.\n TIA\n    submitted by    /u/Ssufferin_Ssuccotash  \n [link]   [comments]",

And, hard as it is to believe, we've actually had a non-zero instance of people leaving with the ClickShare buttons!\n MiraCast is a decent solution for Windows devices, but my understanding is MiraCast is completely unsupported on Macs.\n It seems like there are relatively simple solutions that can be made to work with certain types of devices (i.e. an AppleTV is simple for Macs), but finding a universal solution that works with Win/Mac (and ideally iOS/Android too) seems to be a challenge.\n In a perfect world, it seems like there ought to be some sort of lightweight software agent that doesn't require any client-side hardware (or admin privileges) and would work across all these device types.

That being said, a few duties of my job include, maintaining the corporate network, maintaining our cyber risk standards (updates, anti-virus, MFA, etcetc), and Helpdesk for other employees.\n What's interesting is that over the year, I've been introduced into a few of the other random things IT 'takes care' of.\n We have 2 restaurants in the building that both use an outdated POS system. The guy who maintained the backend left a few months back, so now I'm in control of adding food buttons, prices, taxes and making sure the numbers match in the reports. (That should be a finance dept. thing)\n I'm being trained in SQL, so that I can be a backup once our programmer leaves. But I really don't care for programming. We're looking into Interns/hiring so I don't understand why we just find someone who likes SQL.\n I also have to setup most of the meetings for the execs; Which I'm not really surprised about. Just annoying as it takes me away from what I was working on especially on their 'meeting days'.\n And, I've been making the graphics for a few displays in our employee break rooms that include whatever deals we currently have for employees, position postings, inspirational posts. We have a marketing\\graphics team, but I think they don't even know about them.\n This seems to be a thing that happens in all departments though. My friend in Marketing gets the 'privilege' of driving the co-owner home when he has a fun night at the bar. Keep in mind the drive is 45 mins there and 45 back. And our AV guy has to change the movie that plays on loop in the co-owner's office whenever he calls.\n Overall it's a interesting place to work.

Either it gets stuck syncing, doesn't sync everything, gives errors when downloading cloud files through explorer etc, and it's overall a very poor experience for the customer. \n Doing things via the web browser is fine, but doesn't offer the old school functionality of accessing files via explorer.\n What am I doing wrong?

This is fine, I've created the relevant DNS records and such, and all is well. However, the way Mailchimp links images rather than embeds means that Outlook doesn't display images by default. The only way around this, that I'm aware off, is to set the sender in Safe (Trusted) Senders and Domains for all users\n I've done this via a PowerShell script:\n ``` Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName user@example.com \n $users = Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox \n foreach ($user in $users) {\n Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration \"$($user.UserPrincipalName)\" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add=\"mail.example.com\"} }\n ```\n I have also try to only do one user, eg. Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration \"user@example.com\" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add=\"mail.example.com\"}\n Either way I do this though, the change shows up when I look at junk settings in OWA or Outlook 365 desktop, but within 10 minutes, it's no longer in there, almost as if the change has been undone\n If I manually add the domain to my safe senders list, it remains there absolutely fine, so I don't believe this is some rogue setting or script that's clearing out the safe senders list\n    submitted by    /u/DeifniteProfessional  \n [link]   [comments]",

All RDS have 16 Cores and 64 GB Ram and sitting on a full flash SAN. No GPU. All virtualized on Hyper-V 2019.\n Sometimes user reporting that the server feels slow. If i go to the user and look at his problem i can confirm this problem. The monitoring of the host itself seems okay. CPU wise we are about 20 % with some peaks, but very rarely over 80 %. RAM wise also about 60 %. Disk i/o and network are not real latency. \n The problems for the users are mostly slow responding applications (not crashing) while moving the windows, latency on typing in different applications, and some other stuff. \n For a small test i removed our anti virus (Sophos) but that does not help.\n If i read some old threads here on reddit most other people have much more user per server without issues. So it does not seem an issue on the user/server ratio.\n ATM i'm thinking about buying a hardware server with an GPU to test it. Hyper-V does not really support GPU partitioning or passthrough. We tried RemoteFX last year, but that does not really work.\n So maybe some of you have some input where i can solve my performance issue on these server.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/teqqyde  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everybody,\n Brief context: We have(had) 2 DCs, but one got corrupted during a server migration (things seemed fine for a good while, I was sleeping post-surgery but my director and team member didn’t want to wait until the next Friday, also didn’t follow my migration procedure but it’s fine) and we ended up seeing SID errors in the AD resulting in newer user accounts being auto-deleted, etc etc.\n Troubleshooting went nowhere.\n Solution was: shut off DC2 and see if DC1 has issues by itself. It didn’t. Awesome.\n Now: DC1 is online, DC2 is offline but never demoted (and VM has no NIC config), DC02 (new VM) is a trigger pull away from backing up DC1.\n Questions: 1) If I add DC02 as a DC to the domain using “any dc” as a replication source, can I change this later? (Because I might like to make this “only DC1,” temporarily, which brings us to… 2) I want to bring DC2 online to properly demote it, but how can I ensure it won’t torpedo DC1 with bad/redundant records as soon as they reunite? Can I just (while DC2 still has no network config) set their sync relationship to be 1-way, give it network access again, demote it, shut it down for good? 3) Depending on 2)’s answer, should DC02 be held offline and not joined to the domain until DC2 is gone for good? Or is it safer to add it, test it, then shut it down while sorting DC1&2 so that, if they implode, I can just shut them down and bring up DC02?\n    submitted by    /u/GreatContagion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Dehydrated and its helpers are all bash scripts, so I was able to throw set -o xtrace at the top to see what bash was running, and this was the offending block:\n cliip=`$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip` while ! valid_ip $cliip; do sleep 2 cliip=`$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip` done \n This is a block of code in the Dehydrated helper script for Namecheap, that detects the running machine's IP. Except if the call fails, it gets stuck forever sleeping every 2 seconds and trying again. And as it turns out, the v4 and v6 subdomains to ifconfig.co were deprecated in 2018 and finally removed in January sometime.\n So the upshot is that v4.ifconfig.co/ip should be changed to ifconfig.co and your Dehydrated/Namecheap setup will come back to life.\n Also, set -o xtrace is a lifesaver for debugging Bash scripts that are getting stuck.\n    submitted by    /u/OrangeredStilton  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is very convenient since you don't need to dig up a phone to log in, it can be auto-filled, and easily backed up. However, this is significantly degrading the security of having the second factor in the first place.\n Why it matters: multi-factor authentication is predicated on distributing security into multiple areas, so an account compromise requires significantly more effort. Typically, factors are \"something you know\" (e.g. a password), \"something you have\" (e.g. a phone or hardware token), and \"something you are\" (e.g. a fingerprint or other biometrics).

I don't understand why it wouldn't let me use 4GB.\n ​\n Ammount of RAM on host - 16GB\n VM1 - 4GB\n VM2 - 2GB\n Host uses - 5GB\n So I have available 5GB of RAM.\n That being said, I don't understand why I couldn't allocate 2GB more to VM2.\n ​\n I know there is some allocation rule in HyperV I just can't find it, or I did and I still don't get it.\n How to calculate how many machines can I install and run with X ammount of RAM?\n    submitted by    /u/UnexperiencedIT  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello All! \n I’ve got 2x DL360 Gen10 2019 “standard”servers. Both setup as RAID 10. Server1 is setup as a Hyper-V server hosting 4 vms (2016 servers) and roughly 15 TBs of data including an sql server that is the bulk of the data. \n Server2 is identical to Server1; processor, ram, partitions,etc. This is a fresh server, only Hyper V installed. I have not moved/copied over any vms or data data, just installed a the same roles and applied some updates. Figured over a weekend I’d save off the VMs and import them into server2 and robocopy daily to sync data. Would this work? \n My mission is to figure out a way to have the “in production” server1 in building A sync or mirror to server2 in building B (fiber). In the event of a disaster I’d be able to move server2 into production and keep folks working. Servers are on the same domain, network, vlan and can see one another. \n Is it possible to set server1 up to regularly sync everything including vms and their data to server2 in real-time or hourly/bi-hourly intervals using robocopy? I’m okay with daily, but hourly would be better. MS best practices? Not opposed to 3rd party software, but would prefer a free Microsoft option if available (limited resources). \n Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! \n Tldr, sync 2 identical 2019 standard servers with 4 hyper vms for disaster recovery using robocopy to sync data regularly.\n    submitted by    /u/MothersBukkakeFilm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey, just a quick ramble and I am curious how others see this scenario since it is a very common one. We have about 1000 users in our environment, everyone works from home 3 days per week. The users connect to a VPN from home, just like almost every other company.\n We've had MFA rolled out for a long time with SMS authentication, but recently one of the C-suites was targeted in a SIM swap. We're now switching over to an authenticator-based solution which requires users to have an authenticator app on their phones. It has been going well, but we have a small handful of users (about 10) who are adamantly against using their phones for anything work-related. These users all have smartphones, so there is no technical limitation stopping them from being able to install the authenticator app.\n My ideology is that phones, like internet at home, or like transportation to and from work, are all things that an employee are expected to have. Everyone already understands that they can connect to their own home Wifi to then access our VPN and connect to our corporate network, and that is taking some bandwidth from their other devices. I'm not really seeing the difference between those two use cases as we aren't monitoring their phones, or adding any MDM solution to them. They could feel that way but I'd expect them to already feel that way by connecting a corporate laptop to their home network.\n I know most companies provide cell phones or stipends to employees for phone services if they are expected to use their phones for work purposes but no employee is expected to do anything besides receive a 6-digit code to authenticate when logging in to our systems.\n Management requested us to just set up a group for users who refuse to just leave their policy to only require SMS authentication.\n    submitted by    /u/Beznia  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've recently bought a house that is yet to be build. The expected delivery date of the house is Q2 of 2024.\n The house is a project build and during the build we have option. One of the option is the placement of ethernet connection. You might be thinking, why not do this yourself? Well unlike traditional house building where there is an \"empty pipe\" in the wall to pull your own cable. This construction will not have this. The cables will directly be pulled in the wall during the build of the house. I'm not allowed to do anything while the house is being build until I get my keys. By then hopefully all the walls are in place.\n Here is where I need you…",

Eventually we will see growth end and find that a lot of companies will continue with on-prem and private cloud servers over the massive outages from AWS and Azure. That will require hands on.\n What's your take?\n    submitted by    /u/clickx3  \n [link]   [comments]",

But somehow they expect me to work everyday including weekends. She went as far as kept texting late at night. So this morning she escalated to my manager as if I'm not doing my job. I understand this during business hours but it's as if they expect me to work over the weekend for something that's not an emergency and not responding to it results in an escalation and just making me look bad with management and not only that but it becomes retaliatory in the sense that they make a big effort to make me look bad and at the same time demand higher urgency in retaliation, like trying to make my life harder because I dared to not respond over the weekend.\n This is very usual at my company and the sad part is that company management sides with these bullies, because they're heralded as heroes of the company that keep moving it.\n Sorry for the rant, I just feel sometimes they feel we're not human.\n    submitted by    /u/dazzledtamarind  \n [link]   [comments]",

Meanwhile, we are our own standalone org and aren't required to use the CP's services. Being on enterprise M365 licenses, we've been able to use the Power Platform (Power Automate, Apps, BI, etc) with great success but we keep running hitting ceilings on what we can do without admin access.\n Some of those things would be account creation automation based on roles, dynamic group memberships, Azure AD (we have traditional on prem DC), SharePoint customization, use of Intune, etc. All that is cool, but when the C-Suite learned the CP can technically access all of our email, OneDrive, etc, they became very committed rolling our own tenant. \n So here we are! We've been reading up on implementing a non-routable domain into a hybrid Azure AD setup, email management, MFA setup, what the a transition looks like for our end users, etc but we all know academic knowledge vs implementation experience are two very different things. Fwiw, our CP is supportive of the transition so bad blood and politics shouldn't be a factor here.\n What are your thoughts on best practices, things you would be looking out for, general advice given this scenario? \n TL;DR We're moving away from a tenant managed by a 'provider' to our own in-house management, asking best practices, advice for setup, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/DucksAreOdd  \n [link]   [comments]",

But my last experience with them left me dumbfounded.\n I raised a ticket for an issue that inadvertently affected all of our mobile users, and upon their first email to me I was told it would be escalated to their intune team. I recieved one email from intune support asking to provide relevant information, then radio silence for the next 3 weeks. I sent maybe 4 followups asking when I would get a response, but to no avail.\n Fast forward to today, I finally get an email from them saying they have been trying to reach out to me but I must be busy so they will archive the ticket. Scrolling through the email thread, yes they have been \"trying to reach out\", but all of their emails after the initial one to gather more info were sent to my email address except with the domain slightly misspelled. The thread is full of NDR's.\n I find it hard to believe that someone employed as an intune specialist would not realize that receiving NDR's that my email address does not exist would not realize that I'm not receiving the emails. And what a coincidence that they finally got my email address correct when sending the case closure email. I guess their reply button must have been broken and causing my domain to be misspelled on all the emails where they try to offer assistance.\n Anyways I'm just here to rant, after several days and hundreds of re-enrollments we have gotten things under control.

When working from home I always RDP into my office workstation and for the most part I've had no issues. I have a 3 monitor setup at both work and home. The office workstation is almost 10 years old, and I'm attempting to upgrade to a newer box which is much better equipped but RDP access to the box is much slower, lags, and the most annoying thing is that upon connection the screen flashes black for a couple of minutes (but not every time) before finally settling down. Performance when physically at the box is good, definitely better than the 10yr old box. Both are in the same OU, Have the same Windows 10 Enterprise image, and have the same Group Policy applied. I've disabled the RDP hardware graphics acceleration which my research shows to be a cause of the flashing screen upon connection. I use RDP in the course of my daily routine on various devices and have never encountered an issue like this, RDP is generally something that just works and most of the time I can't even tell that I'm connected to a remote box. It doesn't appear to be a client side issue or a multi monitor issue, performance is consistent if I'm connected across the VPN or locally from any device and no errors are indicated in the event log. \n For a number of functional and psychological reasons I need a physical box that I use both when at home and at the office. Do you have any recommendations on how to improve RDP performance on this new box? \n Here are the specs:\n New:\n HPZ2 G9 i7-12700, 32GB ram, Nvidia RTX A2000\n Old:\n i7-3930K, 32GB ram, Nvidia GeForce GTX 660\n    submitted by    /u/jstar77  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is not clear if this is due to the endpoint protection (we are using Trend Micro Apex One). What is sure on the other hand, is that if I install the Forticlient by hand, it gets uninstalled each time. This happens only using version 6.0.9 (or 6.0.*), while not happening with version 7.\n - Anyone is having the same trouble?\n - Anyone has suggestions on how to troubleshoot this?\n Thank you all.\n    submitted by    /u/gatheringchaos  \n [link]   [comments]",

I manage a small team that is responsible for support and development of in house LOB applications and I am also the escalation point/main point of contact with our MSP who support our Active Directory, Microsoft 365, device setup etc.\n ​\n We have a problem at the moment where our main customer service inbox is at 98% capacity in Exchange Online. We have an in place archive with a retention policy that archives mail older than 3 months and it is increasing in size so we know it is working, but the rate of inbound mail seems to be greater than the mail that is being archived as the inbox size isn't decreasing.\n ​\n To help resolve this we've created a new inbox (which I will refer to as the Customer Service History inbox from here onwards) and we've asked our MSP extract all email sent/received before 01/01/2021 as a PST file to upload into the customer service history inbox - then they will delete all mail sent/received prior to 01/01/2021 from the live customer service inbox.\n ​\n Due to the size of the PST file our MSP is struggling to do this.\n ​\n We had hoped initially that we would be able to use the SearchMailbox PowerShell cmdlets to copy mail across inboxes rather than having to do a PST export/import but these cmdlets have been retired in Exchange Online and I couldn't find a suitable replacement PowerShell command that works.\n ​\n The industry I work in requires us to retain customer emails so we can't just delete all the old mail.\n ​\n Does anyone with more experience in this area have suggestions about what we could try?\n ​\n The ideal outcome is that:\n  \nThe customer service team can still access old emails for complaints/compliance/legal cases\n The main customer service inbox stays well below 98% capacity (for at least another year)\n  \n​\n ​\n Thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/Epileptric  \n [link]   [comments]",

Because of this the users were already set up with beefy workstation laptops and docking stations at home and every office desk before I started at the company.\n The problem is that the CAD files are stored on a central fileserver in the office and when the users work remotely they work off an SMB connection to the office over VPN which results in extremely slow access speeds and file corruptions.\n I wanted to set them up with individual tower PCs at the office instead or at least a pool of a few PCs in the office and let them connect to those remotely with RDP. Though firstly the boss doesn’t like that option because he wants everyone to be able to work at every desk and secondly the test engineers complain about latency problems regarding their 3D work in programs like Revit and AutoCAD. For example they say rotating the view is too cumbersome over the remote connection. I’m currently testing parsec instead of RDP but that has similar problems and is quite buggy.\n So my question is, how do you make occasional remote work, preferably with laptops, work for resource heavy CAD users working from a shared network drive?\n    submitted by    /u/purplepersonality  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of those pins carrying PoE is bonded with the chassis, which I'm guessing is really a powder-coated metal. When you use the metal mounting plate and that is touching metal it makes a nice circuit, then the Ubiquity PoE switch shuts off PoE. \n The AP works great with a grounded or ungrounded patch to the biscuit jack, just as long as it isn't touching anything metal.

Now, the last thing I want to do is go over his head to our CTO and I’ve asked him a few times if he was comfortable signing but keeps asking me to go back to the supplier and have them confirm the most minute of details which have no impact on him signing the proposal. Should I speak with my direct manager and ask his advice and maybe HE can push my director into signing it sooner rather than later?

          "description": "Recently found a very nice high capacity 2.5 inch PM963 for a good price that I mistook for a PM863, the SATA based cousin. So, this post is two questions.\n I wanted to possibly look into adapter options to see if I can get it to run over SATA on a basic adapter. My m.2 slots are full on my main machine, and I have no other PCIe slots. Would that be feasible? I'm unsure if U.2 runs on the same voltage as SAS. I've done a ton of digging on the matter and I can't get too clear of an answer. I've seen cheap adapters like this but I'm unsure if they'll do what I need:https://www.amazon.com/Wixine-Board-Small-Adapter-SFF-8482/dp/B08DLX9YD5?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A1RV7R81U3FOKU\n Before I bought anything else I did want to see if the drive was working with what I already had laying around.I got a working T3600 with a working H310 for free last week that appears to have the latest software on it, but it couldn't see the SSD in Physical Disk Management. It had a SATA SSD in it for a boot drive and all of that worked fine before I went to switching things around. Although I'm quite certain Windows on the poor little Patriot SSD was corrupted at some point. RIP\n I could feel the U.2 slightly warm when it was plugged in which was a good sign. Physical Disk Management couldn't see it. I'm not sure if I need a new cable or other components to get this working correctly just so I can make sure the drive is good. I'm pretty green on this topic. Figured I'd come to the experts. I've done a good bit of research and asked r/IT what this even was to get the ball rolling in the right direction. I'm realizing how strange my request truly is. What would you do in my situation?\n    submitted by    /u/Jfunkey_  \n [link]   [comments]",

When an employee leaves the company, if the supervisor needs access to to their email account afterwards, we keep the user licensed and convert their email to a shared mailbox. We then remove the user license. After a month or so the supervisor will let us know that they no longer need access to the email and so we convert it back to a regular mailbox. As that user no longer has a license I assumed the inbox would disappear and senders would get a bounce back. Seems instead that the users inbox still exists and is receiving messages even though it is not licensed. I am not concerned with backups as we have that covered in another system. I am just curious what the correct method would be to remove the shared mailbox so that it disappears and users get a bounce back if they try to send to it.

My official role is Department Technology Analyst, but that’s just a fancy term as business analyst/IT Support. \n I’ll be in charge of a department to resolve issues for professors, set up new machines on the domain with sufficient apps, recommending/purchasing new devices for department/faculty/staff, etc. This department is mainly Apple with a few hits of windows computers. \n My questions:\n  \nAnyone have tips and tricks as a new IT person?\n Any advice on setting up new computers? For right now, I’ve been setting them up with a local admin account, then adding the device to our Domain, putting my own AD credentials as admin, then installing apps such as O365, Cisco vpn, adobe CC, and such. It’s mostly manual work.. I’ve never scripted before but would like to get this automated.\n  \nAny advice is super helpful and I’m excited to grow in this role. Thank you!\n EDIT: I should say most of the devices I will set up will not be shared, but staff want to start using their AD logins instead of having local accounts.\n    submitted by    /u/ultimateaoe2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I stumbled across a feature in Windows Server 2022 called SMB Compression which, according to my understanding, allows quicker transfer of files over your network by compressing files (if you tell it to). The concept seems relatively straight forward, I think in practice you can use SMB Compression by:\n • Using Robocopy with a /compress switch in your CLI\n • Mapping a network drive using Net using the /requestcompression:yes switch\n • Enabling this option in the Windows Admin Center on a File Server so file copying will default to using compression when end users copy to or from the network share folder on a server with this option enabled.\n My question is - is my relative understanding of this feature, more or less, accurate? Also when it comes to file compression, don't you lose quality when it comes to files such as jpegs, or does it compress the files to transfer them, thus lowering bandwidth requirements, and then decompress the files once it reaches the destination?\n Is this feature relatively esoteric? There really seems like no downsides unless the files stay compressed. Any admins out there successfully utilize this? Thanks all.\n    submitted by    /u/TCIE  \n [link]   [comments]",

You set the pin/etc when you get your license, and then you could perform critical functions by using your certificate vs having to go into physical locations.\n ​\n EDIT: just in case it isn't clear - I'm specifically talking about a state-level/national-level installation of PKI.

Each one can branch off into a few different fields. Some of the fields will ask the user to fill out an external excel file and attach it. For these fields I want to add links to external training documents so they know how to fill out the excel file. Some requests require 1 approver, while others require none or multiple. Some selections should even prevent a user from submitting the form because a change request is not required. \n Right now this change request is requested through email so there’s a lot of user error with what people submit.

Surprise, this was never done! I've contacted MS \"support\" through the O365 admin page and they've basically told me to go fuck myself and it's stuck there forever. For luck I've put in about 20 tickets on this, one actually got close. I feel like MS can absolutely do this if I fill out 700 forms and what not. \n Is there any way I can get this relationship off the tenant? Every time I need to purchase licenses it gets in the way by two clicks, and I'm tired of being reminded that an MSP has us in their poral somewhere.

Just prior to me starting, their accounting department decided to move from some antique accounting software, to using quickbooks. The sysadmin before me set them up with QB desktop and with the company files hosted on VM at a remote data center (which is a couple hundred miles away).\n Big surprise, the previous guy apparently never read the documentation from QB that clearly states accessing a company file over VPN is a shit show. Its massively slow. Like often taking 10+ minutes for a company file to open. To make things worse, the accounting department is using quickbooks in an unusual way, where they have hundreds of company files that all need to be accessible to the ~20 accountants. So throughout the day theyre switching between files and literally spending hours waiting on shit to load. Also, this means quickbooks online is not an option, because you pay per company file, and the service would be absurdly expensive.\n My first thought was to set up a NAS locally and based on some testing, this works great. Its nearly as fast as having the company files on the host. But to throw another wrench in things, the accountants often need to work from home. The DC and ASA are at the data center, and when using VPN from home theyre tunneling all the way to this data center and then all the way back to our office. This is actually so slow that most of the time you cant even open a company file.\n I know the proper solution is to run QB in a VM and use RDS, which I could easily do at our data center, but for whatever reason my boss is vehemently against this option.\n At this point I kind of at a loss.

For instance, we have a client who has an office attached to their house and they all share the same network. It was deemed by my bosses that the reason the office was experiencing slow connections within the application they use is because of the switch they were using. That something might have \"happened\" to it or it went bad. They proceeded to buy 2 switches: 1 for the home network and the other for the office network. I traced the offices lines, plugged each respective line into the dedicated switches and plugged them into the ports I was told to in their firewall. \n After everything was all said and done, I come back to the office and asked my supervisor \"couldn't we have just made things easier by using one switch and separate the network using VLANS?\". He responded \"Well, if something were to happen to the switch, such as a shock to the system, the switch would reset & lose all configurations which would cause havoc\". I was sitting there thinking to myself....well then by that reasoning, why everything else? Everything in tech is just as susceptible to that scenario. If you propose that scenario, then why even have managed switches? \n I recognize that that is an extreme scenario he gave but how realistic is that? Has that ever happened to anyone? Are there way's to mitigate it? Redundancy? Make the switch pull the start-up file from external server?

Network C is the main network, and Network X is the secondary network I have in my office to remote into other off sites.\n Once I captured the scans they appear to be completely different ways of communicating. I can see the the app on the C network communicates using HTTP 1.1 and it goes through a few hoops. I can see the app on X network communicates via DNS. The scans for X Network do not show HTTP linked to this app at all and the scans for C Network do not show DNS at all. The DNS method is much quicker than the HTTP method.\n My question is does that mean that the older C Network is using older/different networking protocols to launch/connect to the app?

We recently decom'd a data center and used a company to relocate a piece of hardware to another one of our datacenters several states away, and used a second company to take away the remaining old decom'd hardware that we no longer needed.\n I've handled nearly all of the quoting, selections, and coordination during this process. On the day for both companies to perform their duties, it was just a disaster. Neither company should've had the problems that they had, putting us in situations we shouldn't have had to be in. This is not the first time I've dealt with bad IT recycling companies...\n It got me thinking and throwing an idea around with a couple of friends. One, an owner of a small trucking company, and another who's a CPA and a part-time small business owner. We're thinking of forming an IT relocation, destruction, and recycling company.\n What issues have you had dealing with these companies? What kind if services are you looking for in such a company? Are you looking for such a company to quickly and simply haul away your old equipment, or do you have equipment of value that you no longer need, and want to have such a company pay some for it to be able to resell? Do you only care about certificates of destruction? Do you want said company to do all the labor, un-racking all your old gear and handle the entire decom/relocation process, or simply have them pick up the already removed hardware, ready to go at the dock? What's most important to you? If quotes of two companies were identical, what would make you choose one over the other? \n It seems like there's a lot of players in the industry, but I haven't had a company provide these services without throwing wrenches into the works.

Probably not unless they're meeting a vendor, need to be there for a meeting with management, or need to do something specific on-site.\n I could see and hear in this morning's meeting that some people instantly checked the fuck out. I think that the IT Manager missed it or is just hoping to ignore it.\n They already have positions open that they haven't staffed. I wonder why they think this will make it better.\n    submitted by    /u/MickCollins  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our environment is a hybrid AD/Azure AD and due to the nature of our business we will likely remain that way for a long time. Our users are already logging in with smartcard but we are looking for something a little more modern. \n With smartcard login already established we have all of the PKI, DC, and other pre-reqs in place for the key trust method. It seems like enabling this would be as simple as adding the Azure AD user to the Key admins group, and enabling the GPO on a few test accounts. \n Reading through the docs i see MS is now heavily pushing the cloud trust method over the key trust. The big driver is simplicity without the needs for all the PKI and other setup. \n Sometimes what MS pushes is whats best for them and not for the customer. So what are your thoughts with the existing PKI in place if you were doing a new WHfB setup would you go key trust or cloud trust. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/teeawayfour  \n [link]   [comments]",

I took the huge pay hit, but started working somewhere really close to home, with a bunch of folks I like, and suddenly have people actually respecting my time off, be it a day or just after 5pm.\n I went from 60-80 hours a week and a big salary (not counting bonuses, SPIFs, and commissions) to making about half, but having more paid time off than I've ever had.\n I'm home at 5:05pm. Every night. Earlier if I jog.\n I drive my youngest kid to school in the morning, and pick them up after. My wife and I carpool again.\n I damn near killed myself for a lot of years, but I have savings for my youngest, and the others have finished their schooling.\n So, I quit the consulting in the Fortune 50 space and went to work at my local \"podunk\" school.\n Best decision ever.\n I took today off, and was invited to an important meeting by very high up folks.\n In my old life, I would have had to (at the least) find a way to call into the meeting.\n Today? Today they apologized for interrupting my time off. They put the notes from the meeting on my desk to review. \n My direct supervisor texted and sent a Teams message telling me not to worry about the meeting.\n I feel like I'm in Europe.

This alert is generated when a user clicks on a link and this event triggers a URL verdict change identification by Microsoft Defender for Office 365. It also checks for any clicks in the past 48 hours from the time the malicious URL verdict is identified, and generates alerts for the clicks that happened in the 48-hour timeframe for that malicious link.

          "description": "I hope this helps someone, we have been running down this very very frustrating path for awhile now. At first I did not believe it was isolated to the new machines our support team was deploying (Latitude 3310) but we have confirmed that to be the case.\n Issue: Users were reporting that during the day Outlook would become disconnected and refuse to re-establish connectivity without rebooting the device. Teams would also have similar issues. A reboot \"fixed\" it for a couple hours. In the AAD logs token refreshes were failing with server/proxy couldn't be found, so I was tracking that down believing it to be related.\n Resolution: I was in the office for the first time in awhile and went to one of our employees reporting this issue as well. I noticed his CPU fan was running non stop, and that really irritates me, so I found the service consuming it which ended up being part of the Dell Optimizer suite. This is \"Intelligent AI-based features automatically fine-tune your PC for the best possible connection, audio and performance.\" NOPE, it sure isn't.\n Dell has a feature called \"Express Connect\" which seems to try and do some QoS style shaping but in real world simply causes nothing but issues. After uninstalling Dell Optimizer and its service (you need to do both) these issues have disappeared.\n TL;DR: Dell Optimizer does nothing to optimize and in fact causes issues that you'll be pulling your hair out on for awhile. Uninstall it and its service.\n ​\n Edit: After KNOWING the issue was Dell Optimizer I am able to locate countless reddit posts about the issue. I almost feel like we need some sort of KB of known trash. We don't reimage these because they are Intune/Autopilot machines going to random sites. \n    submitted by    /u/ydidipickthisdumname  \n [link]   [comments]",

I write them infrequent enough to not be able to visualise a few jobs at a time in my head.\n CronTool has been built together with the Reddit r/programmer community and it got a few novel features that (to my knowledge) you can't find anywhere else. To start, there's a view that allows you to visualise multiple cron jobs - or if you wish: your entire crontab file on a calendar!\n Many of the common crons need 2 or more cron jobs defined, for example:\n Run a cron at two different set times. e.g. I want a cron to run twice daily, at 8:30am and 11:30pm:\n 30 8 * * * 30 23 * * * \n (link)\n Run a cron every 15 minutes throughout the day except at 3AM:\n */15 0-2,4-23 * * * 15-45/15 3 * * * \n (link)\n There is finally a good way to have an overview other those and I hope you'll find this useful too.\n Compared to existing online cron job editor, there are a few things this one can do:\n  \n✅ (obviously) calendar view\n ✅ support for L, W & LW values\n ✅ optional support for seconds & years\n ✅ support for the ? value\n ✅ support for the # value\n ✅ more help & documentation for first timers. Q/A with examples that need multiple crons, for example this one\n ✅ support for debugging multiple crons at once (see above)\n  \nThanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/mindrudan  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have hybrid azure with on-prem ad, laptops are not yet Intune enrolled but are azure ad joined. Windows hello tested and it works. Also company don't want to \"force\" user to use personnal phone (app/number) so we plan to use TAP when users don't want to.\n We planned to help user enable windows hello using TAP/sms/app. Conditional access wil not ask for MFA when on premise (by ip) so it would be only when accessing cloud apps from home.\n But when i test it with windows hello enabled, when challenged for mfa, i can't chose windows hello as a method, Microsoft asks for me to register a MFA method (and redirect me to only authenticator app which annoys me since users can't chose SMS if they want)\n Any idea or best practice on how to achieve that ?

There is a linked Google play account that was set up by the prior MSP who we are unable to contact due to ongoing legal issues.\n I have the account password and previous password but not to the number linked to the account, which is crazy why a mobile number is forced rather than OTP. All account recovery options just fail because of this one single personal mobile number.\n Tried going through support reps and chats just to be told there's nothing they can do and to \"just create a new one\".. which means unenrolling every single Android device... Even though I can prove full tenant ownership, account ownership, can give or create proof of identity but nope. All the same crappy responses from the same script every single time.\n Does anyone know how in earth to speak to someone with a conscience at Google? It doesn't paint them in a good light if that's the only option and they can't help despite situations like these happen in business a lot.

          "description": "I had my first real life encounter with the 2038 bug this week. The situation was caused by a program we have that queries a domain registration API based on expiration date ranges. I had set it to query up to 15 years in the future (even though I know domains can only be registered up to 10 years in the future ... I wrote this thing 20 years ago so I don't remember why I added the extra 5).\n Anyway, 15 years from Jan 23, 2023 (calculated naively as 15 * 365) is Jan 19, 2038. So starting yesterday my query was breaking the API (internal error). The owners of the API identified the problem pretty quickly and confirmed it's the 2038 problem. I changed to query only 10 years in the future and they've now got 5 years to fix it\n I suspect we'll start seeing more of these random discoveries every January, with spikes in 2028 and 2033. Hopefully I'm right in thinking most of the problem code will just get naturally replaced in the next 15 years, but I know I've got a couple of old databases in production that will have to be fixed before then.\n    submitted by    /u/abqcheeks  \n [link]   [comments]",

But no I ended up locking them out.\n In my attempt to recover their files I realized that the BitLockercker key was never stored in Azure or their Microsoft \"My Account\" Page. \n That's when it settled in that I really fucked up.\n My only option was to nuke their computer and hope they had backed up everything to Google Drive or OneDrive. But low and behold they didn't. It's company policy for them to store all their files in google drive and not store any files locally. Still I feel that I really fucked up and I spent 6 hours trying to recover their files and ended up nuking their machine.\n But lesson learned. Don't run dangerous commands on a users machine, and make sure all their files are saved in the cloud if I do have to run dangerous commands.\n I really hope I don't get fired. But I am submitting an Incident report tomorrow morning to the CEO, Co-Founder, and VP (users boss). Let's hope I don't get fucked too bad.

It runs on a pair of Pentium IV computers running Windows XP. Since XP has native DOS emulation, it's the latest version of Windows that will work. Both computers have a crossover cable connecting them with static IP addresses set, so offline and airgapped.\n The customer reached out to me because their HP LaserJet 1160 was having problems and they couldn't get anyone to work on it. They wanted a printer to replace it with, but wanted one with an LPT port. Long story short, I couldn't find any of those handy, but was able to get things working with a USB printer. Enter the Brother HL-L2300D. A USB-only printer that still has Windows XP drivers listed on Brother's website.\n Plug that guy in, install the drivers, share it, and then run\n  \nnet use lpt2: \"\\hostname\\BrotherP\" /persistent:yes\n  \nThen I went into the DOS program and pointed print jobs to LPT2 instead of LPT1. Had to change the print processor from RAW to TEXT to get it printing, but print it did!\n It's not every day I get to work on something this old, and normally I just say \"nah\" to unsupported stuff like this. But it works... they have a hot/warm spare running, and don't need support from the vendor. So why not? I got them running and made them happy, and collected my check.

          "description": "I'm a bit stumped on this. I have a 6tb volume on a Powervault MD3600i filled with mixed data. Two Windows 2012r2 servers are connected to it forming a failover cluster for a file server role. This has been fine for years, but now the role fails to bring the volume online due to a 'thread exit or application request'. I believe this is actually timing out:\n Having removed the disk from the cluster entirely, if I try to bring it online on one of the hosts directly, it takes a long time - 30 minutes+ while disk management is locked up. But you can see constant data being read on the iscsi interfaces before it randomly mounts. The data continues to be read but at this point you can browse the data etc. It's like it's scanning the entire content of the volume. \n I can't figure out why this has started happening - it's the same on both hosts, plus another unrelated server I've mounted it on. I guess the issue is the volume, but once it's mounted everything seems okay with the data, and other volumes on other servers from the same MS3600i are cracking on with life. \n Any ideas appreciated - I am perplexed.\n    submitted by    /u/NickTheSloth  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm using a third party BT Stick that works for all other peripherals I connect perfectly fine and did so for the mouse too - just to clarify it shouldnt be the stick imo. \n ​\n The issue is the following: \n ​\n Sometimes (I cant reproduce) the cursor freezes and I cant use the mouse anymore. Mouse is fully charged. To get the cursor moving again I need to either open - if it isnt already - the Bluetooth settings of Windows or if it is already open close it. This seems to reset a driver or wake a suspended driver or device. All movement and clicks the physical mouse performed while it wasnt working in Windows will then be carried out as if queued for later execution. \n ​\n I cant find an option to disable energy saving and this just started a few weeks ago. Unfortunately I do not recall if it started after an update.\n ​\n ​\n Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/Hoppse88  \n [link]   [comments]",

If the registry value is not configured, the default value is 0x27, which means 'use AES for session keys and RC4 for ticket encryption' - If this target server does not support AES, you must set msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes to 4 on this object so that only RC4 is used. (Please consider working with your vendor to upgrade or configure this server to support AES. Using RC4 is not recommended) - If this target server does not support RC4, or you have disabled RC4 on DCs, please set DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes on DCs to 0x18 or msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes on this object to 0x18 to specify that AES must be used.

Im just asking because I'm curious if there are other better ways. I came from a company which had 3000 Users and we used Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager for creating images and deploying them to specific PCs over ethernet.\n Right now at my new company this is not an option as it would be completely overkill for a small business and cost way too much. What I did instead is set up a virtual machine with windows 10 on my local computer, configure some local policies, install some software and create an image which I then deploy by using usb-sticks and using sample scripts from microsoft for formatting and applying the image. But is this really the best method? What I have to do for every PC after applying the image is updating everything, doing a domain or adding missing drivers which drives me nuts sometimes because sometimes the PC has network problems because of missing drivers, which I then have to add manually. \n What I liked about Endpoint Configuration Manager was that you could automate all of these things. Drivers could be added to the task sequence and where loaded from a specific server which the PC connected to while applying the task sequence. Domain join and updates etc. where also all done while applying task sequence. What was left to do for the admin was just to check if everything worked after the PC finished and most of the time, it worked. Is there any similar, cheaper technology or method which can reach the same level of automation?\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable_Onion318  \n [link]   [comments]",

They got a Sysadmin team with more than 20 people. \n For me this is a very good opportunity as they are prepared to learn me everything from scratch. So I won't be bored as there is a a lot of work. I will even get the oppurtunity to travel abroad with our sysadmin team to maintain the server park abroad. They even offer the ability to earn certificates. \n Not only that, my pay and benefits will also increase significantly. \n My problem is now that I feel guilty about turning in my resignation as my manager will be left alone to manage the whole IT infrastructure in my current company. \n ​\n What is the best approach to this situation and how can I turn in my resignation professionally? \n ​\n Many thanks & kind regards!\n    submitted by    /u/Ghostky123  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have some issues I need to tackle, and I wonder do any of you have any experience in the matter and/or suggestions how to move on with these.\n #1: In our org there are situations where data is given to clients via usb. Client might have whatever OS running, so no guarantees the encrypted USB will work. How have you handled this?\n #2: Preventing data leaking is one thing, but I also want to prevent malicous USB attacks. I can set autorun bans, auto AV scans, but have you tried a forced formatting rule etc..? I know McAfee had such a feature, that it forced you to format the usb wether you wanted to use it. \n ​\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Empty_Commercial4221  \n [link]   [comments]",

And the rest of their office is able to connect to wifi.\n In the past during a similar situation, I was able to fix this by getting someone to restart the Network Location Awareness service (just a random fix I found on Google).\n Sorry for the noob post, I know I deserve to be downvoted to oblivion but I'm panicking as I need to do some work on this server today.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Candid-Chip-1954  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, I am currently working on an RDS environment for a client and ran into a bit of a snag. \n The short version is that the server broker for two RDSs running Win Server 2022 no longer want to load balance people to the second RDS. When disabling additional sign ins for RDS1, users get an error saying that there are no more servers within the server pool. I will note that previous to the issue I will get into, it worked otherwise. \n The context to all of this is that while working on RDS2 I accidentally installed a broker on the RDS. After it was installed, I uninstalled it but afterward the RDS licenses were not working. After getting it paired back up with the licensing server RDS2 appeared fine but the broker refuses to load balance to it. \n As of now, RDS2 can be RDP'd into directly via IP and there is no issue. While going through the broker though it places all users on RDS1. I previously tested it by signing in multiple users and I got as far as 10 users on RDS1 before I stopped. It just appears that something broke within the broker itself but I have no idea where to start. \n I am very new to the sysadmin world and I have tried literally everything I could research. Are there any additional ideas I should try?\n    submitted by    /u/SirReginaldTheIII  \n [link]   [comments]",

The main difference between departments at locations is their shared folder mappings and printers, which can be managed by groups instead of OUs. My main concern is that due to the frequent staff rotation, persons are going to have to be moved to the new location OU and be added to their respective department groups every few months to receive their location and department specific GPOs.

          "description": "Hi all, long story short I got laid off last month after working help desk for a couple of years, before that I've had various somewhat-related IT jobs. I picked up a few CompTIA certs while doing help desk and started throwing my resume at everything with a pulse since my layoff. Lo and behold a small Healthcare company brought me in for an interview for a Sysadmin position (my dream job), something I felt highly unqualified for but thought hey what the heck! Well apparently they liked my resume, and I interviewed well enough, that they offered me the position! My feelings of elation and optimism were quickly replaced with dread, \"what if I completely bomb it\"?\n My last job was basically me working tickets from helpdesk and SOMETIMES using RDP to connect to servers to restart services, and perform various minor tasks. It suddenly dawned on me that I actually have pretty much no experience Administrating Systems! Cool! This is the most I've ever been paid, and it's a great IT position in an area where these jobs are few and far between (20 minutes from a small suburb in West Virginia, yay I live in the middle of nowhere). \n Can some of you guys give me some encouragement? Or give me some confirmation bias that I'm going to get fired on Week 1? Anyone else find themselves in a role like this with a similar story?

          "description": "Disclaimer: I'm a few cocktails in, so forgive this post.\n For nearly two decades I've been IT for what started as a family business, but grew into something significantly larger. Because the family member who started it was allergic to the optics of nepotism, I wasn't an employee, but rather encouraged to start my own business. Background: I hate Windows. My training, experience, expertise and history is in *nix servers, but my family had a business and needed IT help, so I helped. And what started as remotely helping make choices and advising a local technician (who would reformat a Dell PC with a legit license with pirated Windows because it had the settings he liked) resulted in a nearly twenty year stint as a \"consultant.\" I even moved all the way across the country to help. At first, the family business was too small for a full-time IT Guy, so I wasn't hurt when I wasn't hired on ... I just found other clients. But of course the demands and the work expanded to fill the available time - even though the contract didn't keep pace.\n Anyway, I never wanted to be a Windows admin. I never wanted to do this for a career, and finally - as of today - I'm done. \n Next week, I start a job doing what I used to love doing - we'll see if I still like it - but for now, it's a real relief to be done with email problems, Microsoft licensing, and fucking printers. I'd have written more, but the sub has a rule against throw-away accounts. \n  \nDrink a glass with me, /r/sysadmin, here's to actually having benefits, getting paid what you're worth, and doing what you like to do.\n    submitted by    /u/3Vyf7nm4  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are migrating an on premise Exchange 2016 server to exchange online, using CodeTwo Exchange Migration. I am assuming since this isn't hybrid, we can gracefully uninstall Exchange server and remove it from Active Directory.\n However the catch is that we will be setting up Azure AD sync soon after. This primarily to setup MFA on the RD Gateway, using the NPS extension. I've set this up before successfully with an existing tenant, matching local AD UPNs to exchange online mailboxes. In that scenario though, a local exchange server never existed.\n Long story long, can I perform the exchange cutover using 3rd party tools, decommission the exchange server; then setup Azure AD connect? Could there be issues with managing the mailboxes in exchange online once Azure AD sync is setup, even though we were not in a true hybrid Scenario?\n Please let me know what you all think, and if I need to clarify any details.

My issue is more of a technical one.\n So, I'm planning to migrate to a regular IMAP provider and have been able to enable IMAP for my M365 account, but with MS disabling basic auth I can't use imapsync to migrate the email due to it having issues with OAuth.\n I'm not above setting up a local IMAP server and converting my PST file(s) to Maildir if that's what it takes, but I'd rather find something that will just copy everything across and not require any user intervention.\n So I guess my question is whether anyone knows of something that will allow me to do this.\n Powershell script, bash script, installable applications, anything that works and which is NOT \"Copy everything across manually\".\n I run Linux at home and Windows at work, and I'm ideally looking for something fully functional and free.

          "description": "This is technically my first time posting here and just want to get your guys feedback. I’ve been with this same company for 12yrs and I have seen a lot of changes over the years of my employment there. When I first joined it was a non-public company, my previous boss was great, I had time to research on certain projects, put in extra time (not because I had to but I wanted to). Within the years of employment, I’ve seen the company become Public, I’ve been promoted several times, made a name for myself (all the execs know me) and now a manager leading two different teams. However, I feel that it has become more stressful. For me personally I’ve also had things change over the years, I got married back in 2020 to my best friend and we now have a newborn (Baby Girl). I just returned back to work last week and I’m currently struggling on getting back into the groove of things. I’m use to sometimes staying late just to catch up on some work or go in on the weekends to help with maintenance that I can’t necessarily do during the week. You might be asking, why am I doing this…? Because of staffing issues. Yes, I lead two teams but they are a small team and most of them have just started within last year. At this moment, I feel like I’m slowing down and I cannot possibly stay late anymore nor work on the weekends as I use to. My fear is loosing my job due to performance as there are a lot of projects but I feel like staffing is an issue. The one thing I’ve told my employees repeatedly is that Family comes first, no matter what.\n Just thought I’d share on here to get your guy’s thoughts.\n    submitted by    /u/root_exe  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now part of our software vendor vetting/onboarding practice involves getting either a copy of a SOC2/ISO27001 audit report or having them fill out a vendor security questionnaire so we can get a good idea on their data handling processes. I'm going through our backlog of vendors and requesting these of them so I know where we stand risk wise.\n Every vendor I've reached out to has supplied a SOC2 Type 2 or ISO audit report after throwing an NDA my way. However in a first, I've gotten this email back from a certain collaborative tool vendor.\n  \nHey /u/by_frozenriver, Thank you for reaching out and addressing your request!\n SOC 2 report can only be shared under NDA (which is signed with Enterprise customers), so please let us know if you’d like to evaluate it for your company, and we will gladly pass your request to our Sales team.\n We're glad to inform you that the option to download a SOC 3 report is available on our website. We'd like to point out that diagrams in SOC 3 report are publicly available as a preview, the actual files in high resolution fall under the Security review that we conduct for Enterprise customers only. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused here, but as per our internal Security Policy it is not possible to share the docs in question with non-Enterprise customers and that is not something the Support team is allowed to share at all as we do not conduct Security reviews.\n  \nI've reached out to them to see if they'd fill our security questionnaire in that case. But still, what a weird practice. Pay for the product (on it's highest tier) and then we'll show you that it's safe?\n Definitely going to be looking into alternatives before this annual commitment is up.\n    submitted by    /u/by_frozenriver  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm especially interested in feedback from this crowd since I imagine many of you have pushed out large scale distributions of thunderbolt docks - possibly varying models and brands.\n I dipped my toe into the waters of thunderbolt starting 4-5 years ago with the Dell WD19. I only got around 10 of them in place, but every single one of them would periodically stop recognizing that they had an ethernet connection until the user unplugged and replugged the dock and then rebooted their laptop.\n Then around 3 years ago I rolled out about 50 Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Gen 2 docks with matching X1 Carbon laptops. It seemed like around 50% of those docks ALSO had similar issues, dropping ethernet occasionally, as well as USB devices no longer being recognized, and HDMI outputs dropping their signal. Again, easily resolved with a reboot of the laptop and maybe a power cycle of the dock... but frustrating my users. Since then the reliability rate seems to be much improved... about 90% of those docks are fully reliable now running on Lenovo's latest 3.1.81 firmware plus Intel's latest thunderbolt drivers/firmware. Though oddly, the remaining 10% are unreliable despite all of those same updates.\n And so I've moved on to replacing those remaining 10%, and have mostly been replacing them with the Caldigit TS4... which is obscenely expensive. But (knock on wood) so far with a limited roll out, I've yet to have any user call me about an issue once the initial setup and firmware update was done.\n    submitted by    /u/Threxx  \n [link]   [comments]",

After three weeks that I felt like I was failing constantly, not being able to focus on the important tasks and being overwhelmed with the sheer tasks to do, my boss is finally coming back on Monday. \n That said, I attended company dinner today.

For those who don't know what a complaint box is, it's a box where you can file complaints anonymously. I was shocked when the Junior read the message out loud and the first thing she said was my name. My whole body tensed up. Then she continues \"I want to thank you for your help. You are always kind and you solve all my problems. I whish the company would give him a extra reward\"\n I was not expecting that at all. It never happened to me before. It gets even more surreal. As the clapping the toned down, service department leader stood up and said: \"On that note, i want to add that he is alone at the moment and has a shit ton of work but he even worked late yesterday because I needed him to set up something for me\"\n This feels so great.

          "description": "Most of our PCs are connected to our domain with passwords managed through our local AD server and synced with Azure AD. For those accounts/PCs, when logging into the device, the password is case sensitive and using incorrect capitalization will cause the login to fail. However, it has come to my attention that for at least one of our machines running Windows 10 Pro (21H2, 19044.2486), which is connected to a consumer Microsoft account, Windows accepts the login password regardless of the case of the letters. That is, if the Microsoft account / PC login password was BlueCyber, a user could login with bluecyber or BLUECYBER or bluEcYbeR.\n Everything I've read makes it sound like that shouldn't be happening. Is there a setting somewhere that controls case sensitivity checking on Windows 10 with login via Microsoft accounts?\n This isn't a huge vulnerability, but it does mean passwords are weaker than we otherwise expected because it effectively eliminates 26 characters from the character set.\n    submitted by    /u/BlueCyber007  \n [link]   [comments]",

I mean, after a spate of therapy and treatment for depression and anxiety, I've been referred on for ADHD assessment. I've just set the ball rolling on that now, because ... well, I know self diagnosis is something of a dubious thing, but over 20 years in the profession I'm increasingly believing that \"this is me\". \n But I've fallen into an ecological niche in the business world that suits my brain. \n Because my 'coping strategies' are also ... genuinely beneficial for a 'sysadmin' role. Being great at analysis and problem solving helps me cope with really poor memory retention. I often can't remember things from the previous day, let alone week, but ... that's ok, because I can get to the same place and continue quite rapidly. Working off tickets means my retention doesn't matter. Hyperfocus on something that interests me is amazingly useful when it comes to understanding how all the pieces of a complex system mesh together. etc.\n There's also some things I just know I can't do though, and I avoid those.\n https://www.ted.com/talks/jessica_mccabe_this_is_what_it_s_really_like_to_live_with_adhd_jan_2017\n The standard ADHD screening questionaire is this one: \n https://add.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/adhd-questionnaire-ASRS111.pdf\n    submitted by    /u/sobrique  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have a customer who has 20+ of our systems and the HMIs are Rockwell PanelView Plus 7 Performance Series A terminals that run Windows CE 6.0. Due to Windows CE 6.0 being obsolete, Rockwell has phased out Series A and introduced Series B terminals that run Windows 10 IoT Core. Now, with series B terminals- IPP printers are supported.\n At the completion of each product run, a report is generated on the HMI and a screen capture print is sent to the printers via network. It has become extremely difficult to find a modern printer that is still compatible with the drivers available on Windows CE 6.0. With the introduction of the Series B terminals, our customer now needs to maintain multiple printers- ones for the old Series A terminals and ones for the new Series B terminals.\n Is there a print server solution available that would emulate older printers that the Series A terminals can send their print job to via network using an existing Windows CE 6.0 printer driver, then convert and re-transmit the print job to a modern printer (IPP)?\n    submitted by    /u/Dustball_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Im getting a \"you do not have the sufficient privileges to delete \"intern 15-16\" or this is protected from accidental deletion - yet im currently using the domain/sysadmin account.\n This AD has seen several owners prior to my hire 5+ years ago and im trying to strip the AD down to everything minimal in the sense of active users, computers and basic object folder - not extra clutter. I feel getting the AD somewhat back to a fresh start would be easier in the long run, all the permissions and groups need to be revisited as there are groups for folders that a \"S\" would appear in what used to be a user - it annoys me.\n If i can confirm these arent marked for \"accidental deletion\" is there a way to remove them or even set back to default an AD object tree? I dont know if i can afford to create a new AD on the WS2016 or if its possible to migrate only specific workstations or users from the older DC. \n ​\n I do plan on rebuilding all the file folders on the File Server with correct permissions moving forward but im trying to leave as much of the old infrastructure behind as i can without having to migrate over a potential issue. \n ​\n ​\n TLDR; is there a effective way to cleanup old AD DS permissions and broken paths in AD to prepare for a Migration to WS2016 smoothly?\n    submitted by    /u/travvy13  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have had multiple users report that our IT service desk webpage keeps opening itself randomly. \n This morning, I went to see a user and do some digging. In front of me she started typing an email, pressed shift+A and the IT helpdesk web page opened. She closed it, and then went back to her email and pressed shift+A and the helpdesk did not open. Each user reporting the issue says the same thing. There is no consistency as to when it does it or what key combination causes it. \n I have searched the registry for the domain of the helpdesk without the https:// or trailing slashes and nothing came up.\n I have checked all desktop shortcuts for keyboard shortcuts on the helpdesk shortcut, but the user did not even have any shortcuts to the helpdesk in their profile anywhere. \n The user I was with went off on the ward to sort some bits out whilst I dug into the issue, and I asked the other user in the room if they had the same and they said they have had it happen randomly to. It happens on different computers and it does not matter if they use the ward generic account or their account, it happens either way. \n ​\n Has anyone come across this or got any ideas as to where else I can have a look? The bit that has thrown me off is the keyboard combination that triggers it is not static.

I've been doing fine on my own, but recently, the company hired a new warehouse and shipping specialist to handle shipping and receiving packages as well as to keep track of inventory for the whole company. \n In about three months, this person has engineered a situation where now the company is dependent on her to run the business: every time we need the get the materials to build the stuff we make, we need to go through her to get it. She did it under the guise of improving company operations and keeping better track of inventory, however, I strongly suspect she is far more interested in gaining control and power within the company. I am extremely creeped out by her. \n Now she's is targeting my department. She has been demanding that I hand over my inventory of computers, servers, networking equipment, etc. I think she wants to engineer the same scenario with me, where if I want to deploy a new computer/server, I have to go through her first. So far I've resisted these demands, mainly due to security, as I don't want the information of our sensitive IT infrastructure to fall in the wrong hands. But the other main reason is that I'm just flat out creeped out by this person. \n I've been with the company for longer than she has, and I have enough clout with two of the owners who are siding with me. Two of the owners are siding with her. This is a very interesting dilemma I'm finding myself in, and I wanted to ask my fellow sysadmins on what are your thoughts?

          "description": "Ideally, I'd like to run esxi and multiple VMs on top of it. My current hardware is HPE ProLiant Gen 9/10 servers. Each of these servers have 8 bays for hard disks. I've got a mixture of SATA SSDs, SAS HDDs of various sizes in them. \n And recently the disks started failing, mostly the SAS HDD disks. And I assumed that they must be bad so was planning to replace them with SATA SSDs but I realise after a quick google search, I may have been on the wrong path. And I asked a question about the disk failures here and the answers only provoke more questions in my mind. \n As a novice who just started out on system administration, I'm now wondering what's the best disks out there for what I'm trying to do and what's the best RAID configuration for what I'm trying to achieve?\n I understand that there are countless ways of doing what I want to do. I also understand that if I opt for external storage (with vSANs?) I might be better off as the resources are pooled together, I'd like to understand how I can do it better with what I have (by may be replacing just the disks) and also a future plan when the budget allows to strengthen my infrastructure. \n A colleague recently told me that disks fail for whatever reason and if they're in warranty you just claim from supplier or you buy a new one. Although arbitrary, it doesn't sit well with me. There must be reasons and best practices that the industry follow. I'm only trying to find that out. Can someone please help me out? \n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/the4amfriend  \n [link]   [comments]",

I work for an MSP subcontracted to a customer and I'm struggling to find a solution to managing access for the guest wireless.\n The customer have a Wi-Fi network set up for guest use using Meraki NAT so it doesn't touch the LAN.\n Previously they had a preshared key that was given out to guests who came to their office. This worked for a while until people started complaining it was mega slow. I log on to Meraki cloud manager and find there was more than 100 devices connected to this SSID. This network is also speed and bandwidth limited to preserve resources for LAN traffic on the APs. It looks like people had been using the PSK to add their own personal devices to the guest wireless thereby slowing it down.\n Before Christmas, the password was changed and it was decided it it was only visible to IT staff who enter it into guest devices when they arrive, but this is far from ideal for a number of reasons.\n I have also suggested changing the password every month and only giving the password to the receptionist who then gives it to the guest. But there are concerns from management the receptionist will just give it out to anyone and we are back where we were before.\n I did look at the Meraki sponsorship option for the guest wireless but this has no reporting feature and no way to authorise specific people who can be sponsors. Again, this is a problem because people will just start authorising their own devices, with no way of seeing who is doing this.\n All the APs are various Cisco Meraki models.\n How are you guys managing guest wireless in your workplaces?\n    submitted by    /u/Psjthekid  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some other applications that share significance or that rely on the internet connection also can't update or work online while some can. There were couple of weird things that left me puzzled, I tried to get on google chrome, while it let me access the internet, could download stuff on it, However, when I tried to get on Mozila or other indie browsers i ended up with \"No Internet\" error. When I used Jdownloader for example on google drive I couldn't access it but when I used bittorrent I could download stuff from it. So through trial-and-error approach my leads were to try and stop dns client via group policy which was impossible because I couldn't even click on the stop or pause button. I also attempted to flash ipconfig via cmd, renew it as well but it didn't work. What else I tried was to controlset1 and change its value to 0 in the regedit, I also attempted to manually enter the proxy 8.8.8.8 ip in the internet settings, none of it worked. So I'm truly hoping that I won't need to reboot my pc fully once again.

Is this the right way of doing it but then just logging in as Global Admin and setting them back to standard user?\n I don't have a spare license just for a enrol type account, so think doing it as user is the only way.\n 2) Since its a new profile for AzureAD does Forensit tool work for migrating? (like it does with domain accounts)\n 3) What's the order in which this should be done?

The issue is the Windows change password screen which obfuscates the password text, so whenever they're trying to enter a new password they lose track of what they've typed in because they can't see the characters, get frustrated, and give up.\n So what I'm looking for are any \"Alternate\" methods for user password updates?\n I should add this is on an Active Directory Domain, and despite being a very big corporation actively block Azure Active Directory domain join so that rules those features out. We do use Okta for SSO and Identity, which in theory could work with password writeback but it's still a bit cludgy as the local computer must sync with the domain while connected via VPN, meaning an account re-login.\n (Under normal circumstances this would be a non-issue, but I wouldn't be making this post if it was)\n The very minimum I've got working as a happy medium is to enable Windows Hello PIN logon for their local machine, but that doesn't help when it comes to their corporate AD account and any screen/menu where a password cannot be easily entered.\n    submitted by    /u/Radiant_Fondant_4097  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do you use a password per site? Random? Or derived from something you can remember? \n And where, if anywhere, do you store those passes? Do you write them down on sticky notes then stick them on your monitor? Into a text file?

And moved to a self-hosted Vaultwarden server + Bitwarden clients on my devices. \n It's completely free (discounting the RPi at home I use for other stuff as well), I get to keep all my passwords somewhere I know of, and as I only access the Vaultwarden server over a Wireguars tunnel (without exposing anything else to the public internet), I daresay it's also decently secure.

We access the environment via AWS user VPN which then traverses a site-to-site VPN to the environment. We considered using AWS Workspaces for this, however it does not play well with our external IDP. This has us back to the drawing board on solutions.\n First, I'm curious if anyone has personal experience with this using AWS AppStream and what up/down sides came with that. What I am unclear about is if I can use AppStream to connect to a Jupyter or Datalore instance running on-prem across the S2S tunnel or will it only work with SageMaker in the AWS VPC?\n Second, I'm open to any other solutions. What was attractive about VDI and AppStream is that we can control copy/paste and file transfer. But, with workspaces and our current IDP we can't get MFA enforcement working.\n Thanks in advance for any help.

Instead of spending a few thousand dollars on upgrading the aging hardware I'm considering migrating them to Azure AD / Intune as they have mentioned moving to the cloud. This could be beneficial from a management perspective as well as no hardware costs and potential hardware failures.\n Their current setup:\n  \nDomain Controller - Windows Server 2016 \n Used for very basic AD functions and DNS (DNS would be migrated to the Fortigate). Pretty much just used for creating users and authenticating them to the domain, no complex policies or in depth configurations.\n \n File Server - Windows 10 machine\n Microsoft 365 Business Standard licenses - Outlook & Office apps\n  \nI am unsure of the best practices when it comes to migrating everything over smoothly. The client heavily uses AutoCAD & Revvit and stores all of their files on the file server, so its unlikely file storage would be moving to the cloud but I would likely upgrade the file server or replace it with a NAS. They use Fortigate VPN to occasionally reach the file server from home to access these files. Will I run into any issues if we keep the local file server and move them to the cloud?\n Would you recommend migrating this client to the cloud and if so what would be my best course of action? From what I've gathered it sounds like a fairly simple process, upgrading the Microsoft 365 licenses to Business Premium, setting up AAD, Intune and Autopilot, either saving their profiles with Profwiz or wiping their devices, joining to AAD and letting autopilot do the work.

The exact switch model has not yet been determined. \n The HBAs in the servers have two ports, both of them will be used. \n The clients will be connected via the 1G ports on the switches.\n ​\n On the hyper-v will run services like fileserver, dcs etc on vms.\n ​\n Will this work and did i forgot anything?\n    submitted by    /u/Icy-Committee-4030  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is a solo IT gig.\n Current salary: $81k (yes, I know it's low by most people's standards in HCOL areas)\n Experience: 21 years, 13 at current job\n Location: US Midwest (city of ~100,000)\n Job situation: 130 staff, soon to be 140. 5 locations with most of the staff at the primary location. Very little remote staff, mostly onsite. This is technically a 24-7 operation (overnight is minimal) and I'm expected to be generally available to answer calls, but nights & weekends happens rarely...like maybe once or twice a month I'll get a call (very chill place). We are a Microsoft / O365 business with an on-prem 2-node Hyper-V cluster that runs 9 VMs. Pretty standard SCCM, WSUS, DCs, fileserver, certificate services, SQL, Sage, UniFi networking gear, and I manage the PBX. We outsource printers and AV systems. Otherwise, everything gets squished into my job, which I honestly like (I know some of you are ready to pounce and tell me I'm nuts). Also, I don't want to leave this job & only plan on working a few more years. My gut says $90-100k\n Edit: should have included that I've researched salary ranges for my area.

I woke up this morning like any other morning and while scrolling through Reddit in bed, I saw the first few posts of the problem being reported. That sure was a wake up call. \n Thanks to the OPs, commenters with solutions, and others chatting, I was able to \"fix\" and reduce the impact of the problem before everybody starting showing up. My org has tens of thousands of devices and employees. This problem would have been a nightmare to handle. Thankfully, because of those posts and comments, I was able to stay 2-3 hours head of Microsoft's response, which saved us. It's very rare, but we were able to set up full resolutions and responses before users started to call us with problems. Overall, we had a few thousand devices impacted, but it only ended up being around 35% or less of our total fleet. Still bad, but it could have been sooo much worse. I know I can't be the only one in this boat.\n Talking with multiple Microsoft employees (Support, fast-track, devs), they asked me to link to the Reddit posts that I quietly brought up when I said it was a global issue. Congrats to those OP's! Your posts have been seen by everyone! It looks like Microsoft is currently working on solutions to help with impacted shortcut files so only time will tell at this point.\n Again, big thank you to everybody, from the OP's to the people leaving comments. Even the lurkers up voting topics. Today is one of those days where I'm thankful that a community like this exists. If you had this problem at your organization, I wish you a speedy recovery. If you didn't, enjoy this time to relax before the next big problem comes through. Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/AyySorento  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each server has close to 60TB of data stored on these external shelves. They're in production, and actively serving customers. The two servers and all 6 shelves are covered under a support contract with HP.\n On December 14th I opened a ticket with HPE Support using the serial # of one of our servers which is under support contract. After a month of back and forth regarding firmware / BIOS updates required on the servers, and sending numerous AHS logs, and doing a bunch of un-related troubleshooting, the support engineer tells me that they can't do any more and I have to open a case up using the disk shelf's serial number.\n Why couldn't you fucking tell me that at the beginning!! Instead HP support wasted a month of our time. Days between responses on a ticket that is marked as \"Critical Degraded\". Stressed us out over the holiday's causing several of us to have to work over the holiday's to run CHKDSK on the volumes, and worrying that our data might get lost.

This system is one that me and my team are responsible and own. She doesn't really come from a technical background, but my former boss (left the org) told her 3-4 years ago that this solution isn't going to meet our needs or work well. We're being forced to integrate it and have serious concerns about performance/stability impacts. The vendor's implementation team doesn't seem all too concerned and during one call the consultant started whining like a child that we were delaying the roll out. She seems to be siding with the vendor and pushing aside any of our concerns. It's just a frustrating and stressful situation overall and one of the many drivers that's causing me to consider new roles.\n    submitted by    /u/Impossible_Okra  \n [link]   [comments]",

An attacker with physical access to the target could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to encrypted data.\n Are there additional steps that I need to take to be protected from this vulnerability?\n Yes. You must apply the applicable Windows security update to your Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). For more information about how to apply the update, see Add an update package to Windows RE.\n Are both offline images and WinRE in a running environment affected by this vulnerability?\n No. Only a WinRE image on a running PC is vulnerable. This can be any time a recovery or reset operation is invoked from the main OS.\n ​\n So:\n 1) JUST the CU doesn't fix it. You have to patch WinRE. Most people won't do this.\n 2) Since the Windows Recovery environment is not encrypted/protected, someone could just 'replace' the WinRE.wim file with an 'old, bad one', and exploit this vulnerability, even if you patched 'your' device.\n Have any organizations/anyone else spoken about this? It seems to have effectively slipped under the radar, and while it would be 'hard' to exploit, maybe, and 'hard' to replace a WinRE environment... it's not THAT hard.\n I'm not saying \"go 3rd party\", by any means, but this seems... bad?

But once it is set it will be correct next time this user logs in.\n So this only happens the first time each user logs in. \n The soundcards are not the same in each classroom so we are not going to take care of this by some group policy.\n I know about the default user profile settings, but the computers are all on domain but with different soundcards between classrooms. So what I am trying to figure out is the best practice if I can log me in on the computer for the first time locally, set the sample rate to correct settings and then every other domain user that logs in after that will get the same settings. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/gasgeir  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Since I started working at my current employer there has been a lot of patching and fixing various security holes. Guy before me was tech savvy but not comfortable with server environments etc, the age old tale. Without going into too much detail, we have a department which does a lot of development. Until recently, all of these employees (approx 15 people) all had local admin rights (users added to AD group, GPO set said group as local admin on all workstations). Obviously we don't want that many admin accounts, even if they only have those privileges on workstations and not servers etc, let alone people who do not work in the IT department. \n As you may have figured out, this caused some outrage among the developers. We are not big enough yet to have a \"functional\" helpdesk and utilize LAPS in an effective way so I'm still walking around approving installs. However, so far that has only happened once since this change was applied. This makes me believe 1. they vastly exaggerate the amount of times they do things that require admin privileges (no surprise) and 2. This is more of a \"hurt ego\" situation where they are more upset over being \"downgraded\" than it is an actual issue. \n Do you think I made the right call or is it overkill? \n TL;DR: Developers lost their admin rights and are upset. I think it is a major security hole to let an entire department have admin rights. I believe they are more upset of having been \"downgraded\" than it actually being a problem, but I'm doubting myself. \n Thank you!\n P.S I am the only one doing IT and we are >100 people in three countries\n    submitted by    /u/simedr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well sometime in the last 30 days, my domain controllers stopped talking to each other. Remote is PDC, other is onsite. They are in separate sites in active directory.

If the option is selected to sign into other apps, the other apps will keep that session in future Windows sessions while Outlook does not.\n It seems to be something related to the cross-tenancy situation, but finding information about this has been difficult.\n We've tried downgrading the modern auth for these users by setting DisableADALatopWAMOverride to 1, however the prompts continue regardless.\n Does anyone have any extra insight into this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/mccarthyp64  \n [link]   [comments]",

Eventually, it broke, and because it's deprecated, MS refused to help us fix it (the no IPv4 issue was also a point of contention, but we worked around it). So, we moved to Always on VPN configured to connect to our Sonicwalls. Unfortunately, some users complain of frequent connection drops, and for a significant number of people, the \"Always on\" functionality just isn't there, they have to manually connect it.\n Ideally, we'd like a machine based VPN that connects before login (like DirectAccess), so thinks like SCCM can function without an active user.

          "description": "I think this is the right community for this topic, but if you think there is some other more adeqaute sub reddit, please tell me.\n I am in the process of migrating our Hpe StoreVirtual (LeftHand) VSA cluster to a new (and supported) solution.\n Our HCI infrastructure is a basic two nodes stretched cluster, in a network raid 10 configuration. These two nodes are in two different CEDs rooms, connetcted through a 10GbE fiber cable. LeftHand has proven to be a reliable solution in these 8 years we used it.\n The only (big for me) cons I have toward Hpe is the support policy: if you do not have a valid maintenance contract, no one besides hpe personnel can gain access to the OS in case of problems. I mean the OS of the StoreVirtual virtual machines that \"do the magic\" abstracting the local storages and make them visible to the vmware cluster as a (one or more) vmfs shared datastore(s).\n Our reseller strongly advised us to move to Hpe SimpliVity, because that's the natural step forward basing on our specific topology. SimpliVity too has the (big) limit above: once it will go EOSL you will not be able to gain access to the \"ninja\" console in case of troubles.\n Personally, I gave a look to Vmware vSAN solution and I proposed it as an alternative to my reseller. They discouraged me for the following reasons:\n - VMware vSAN solution is not natively fit for a two nodes stretched cluster. It born for a three nodes cluster, and in order to cover the gap with other vendors, it later adapted the solution to work with two nodes solutions as well.\n - vSAN does not have the \"data locality\" peculiarity. Data blocks for a given virtual machine are written across the nodes, independently from where the vm is located. SimpliVity, as opposite, has this advantage (inherited from StoreVirtual VSA after all).\n Do you agree with this analisys or the reasons cited above are weak and vSAN is in any case a better solution for my cluster topology?\n Thank you,\n Francesco\n    submitted by    /u/bianko80  \n [link]   [comments]",

Other exec's have been promoted from within, so they got their IT orientation when they came on board as manager, rank-and-file staff, etc. This person is new to the organization.\n My usual orientation involves a bit of a discussion on how to get support, how we handle IT assets, where to find important data, important distribution lists and groups in outlook, where to find printers, brief conversation about IT policies (and where to find and agree to them), and so on.\n Specific LOB tools are oriented by other groups - HR does the bit about payroll tools, finance/purchasing does their bit about procurement, and so on.\n It occurred to me that this is probably more finer detail than this person needs or wants. I was thinking that I should probably keep high level - save your data \"here\" (OneDrive), we use Teams as a communication platform, here's how you get support...\n If you're the new executive to a company, and you've got ~30 minutes of an IT orientation, what's the most effective use of that time?\n    submitted by    /u/timatlee  \n [link]   [comments]",

We actually could restore it but we have lost of lot of the licensing for it and dont really need it anymore as we only used it for updates and laptop deployment. So it's only windows updates that is the issue now. I cant seem to recall where I setup the gpo to point to the internal ms server aka sccm. I need to undo this and for now have them all go to the internet until I get wsus setup for servers, I've tried rsop and everything and cant seem to find the right gpo to change this because rsop shows that it is the local policy where this was set.

When I get there, though, all the IT guy would let me do is take pictures/notes and would only give me the password to the guest wifi. I said this isnt enough for me to do the audit and he just kind of shrugged. His boss is gonna be pissed though when all i provide them is a rack diagram and a port map. They should've given me access to the corporate network if they want a full audit right?

I'm self-taught in SQL and Server admin, and the guy that had previously setup the network I'm working on is out on medical leave (not expected back before go-live). \n We're a small company, that recently decided to open a second location several states away from our current. Our current network is a 10.10.x/23 setup, with 1-79 reserved for static devices (servers, switches, printers, network connected manufacturing devices), and the rest as DHCP for internal and guest networks. We're very close to our 512 address limit. Our new location is expected to roughly need 20 more static addresses, and peak around 100 DHCP between internal and guest. My initial thought was to use the same DHCP host, expand the subnet to a 10.10.x/21, block of a larger range for statics, and expand DHCP range for the rest. \n However, I get the impression that I can create the 2nd location network as it's own 10.10.x/24 range, and use DHCP Relay to enable communication without having to rework all of the local stuff. That should just require some changes to the initial DHCP, and DNS, but otherwise will all be configurable on the Firewall at location2?\n ​\n So in things needing adjusted in Loc1 (ex. 10.10.100/23)\n -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)\n -DHCP Host\n -DNS Host\n -rest of the network is no-change\n Loc2 (ex 10.10.200/23)\n -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)\n -rest of the network is nothing extra to setup\n ​\n Is this best practice?

This endpoint is restricted in the firewall to a known Allowlist of customer FQDN and IP addresses. \n Orders from a particular customer stopped flowing this week. We reached out to the customer Tech Support for assistance, no response. After a backlog of about $200,000 worth of purchase orders had stacked up, I dug in.\n I knew that the customer's app was trying to make a connection and assumed they were hitting us from an unknown and disallowed IP address. Using Packet Capture and wireshark, I was able to sift though all of the Scans, bots, and other nasty traffic and ended up correlating inbound dropped packets to outbound confirmation requests (from other TCP streams initiated by us). The source and destination IPs were different, but both in Google Cloud.\n I took an educated guess and whitelisted an unknown IP Address and the orders started flowing again.\n Turns out the customer had migrated their services to Google Cloud and had not informed their downstream vendors of the change. \n I love this detective work, using wireshark to solve these kinds of mysteries and investigating what is otherwise \"invisible\".\n I'm a generalist - a mile wide and an inch deep but have recently developed a strong desire to specialize in networking or Cyber.

And users lost access to some of the servers NAT'ed on outside. Since we don't have access to the ISP gateway to clear ARP cache, we needed to contact the ISP support, unfortunately no one responded in a timely manner.\n So the situation is that we need to wait till the arp timer expires in the ISP gateway and we don't know how long it takes and we cannot afford a long outage. So we had to fix this issue asap without performing a failover or any changes in Palo Alto to trigger GARP. \n Then we found this command  test arp gratuitous ip <ip/netmask> interface <interface name>  which would manually trigger a GARP and it saved our day. It updated the upstream ISP gateway ARP tables. I know that we could do this in Cisco ASA and Firepower but wasn't aware that this is available in Palo.

The state changed to connected, and still no traffic getting through.\n The trunk that was working was 10G MMF fiber. I could still see the other switch via CDP, but no traffic getting through. I changed the SFP+ on both ends, and I was able to ping the other switch, but it was really bad. When I sent 100 pings to the other switch, it would timeout at random intervals. 80/100 success rate. The trunk link is at 10G full-duplex on both ends. \n I tried 1G SFP, and still no dice. The 1G SFP MMF states were down down. So I went back to SFP+.\n I swapped the fiber from orange to aqua, and it was worse. With aqua fiber, there is no traffic at all, but CDP is working. I changed ports and still no traffic. I swapped to copper, and the same - CDP is working, but no traffic getting through. \n The config on each port is the same. Upstream Switch (i think it is a 3850):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 nonegotiation  Downstream Switch (I think it is a 3750):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 Switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q nonegotiation  This whole time the 3850 led was green, but the 3750 was amber.

Our solar network needs to communicate to 192.168.0.100 to get data from their existing electrical infrastructure. Their 192.168.0.100 is not connected to the internet due to security reasons, it's literally got an unmnaged switch with no router even, we are allowed though to connect onto that network as long as their computer doesn't have any internet access. Secondly, we've got a TV in the entrance of the building displaying data from the solar for the clients to see, it's almost a 800m run so would rather want to utilise and try to work through their existing network, running a new cable is very hard due to access.\n I please need assistance on how to get traffic from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.5 without interfering with their existing network (not sure if it's called port forwarding?). Client has a network engineer on site but I'm getting the feeling he's not 100% sure how as nothing has been actioned yet, I can hopefully relay info from here to him and see if he finds a way.\n Then I please need assistance on how to get traffic to and from 192.168.0.100 from 192.168.2.2 , is it perhaps port forwarding on the Teltonika and Cisco side? And then setting up a firewall rule on the cisco side to not give internet access to 192.168.2.2?\n I can, going to be hard though, run a seperate cable from the Teltonika straight to the 192.168.0.100 network and then the 192.168.0.100 network is not going to be connected to the Cisco network at all, but then I'll need advise on how to set up on the Teltonika side to not give internet to 192.168.0.100 but still be able to access it.\n Thanks in advance for any assistance!\n    submitted by    /u/Beginning_Brief_534  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example: I've got a batch of PA Firewalls that insist on doing panorama connectivity checks after I change the management IP (a fine idea)... but they start doing these checks before the new IP has actually been applied (a deeply stupid idea) resulting in those checks of course failing and config reverting, even with several retries configured.

They say this will work, but is still vulnerable to problems.\n Option #1 seems like way overkill to me. \n I'm suggesting that they not go with shielded cable, but in case they decide shielded, what recommendation do I give them about grounding options?\n    submitted by    /u/kcornet  \n [link]   [comments]",

The two buildings can currently talk to each other's devices as things stand today. Now I've been asked to move some (but not all) of the equipment from one office to another: VMware Host, NetApp and the ESXI switch stack. I can do basic switch configuration, trunks and vlans and whatnot but networking isn't my strong point. I know enough to hurt myself on the sharp edges. What I'm wondering is: \n If the Core Switch (lets say its 10.1.1.1) is at Building A, if I move the ESXI switch (10.1.1.2) to the other building, is it possible for me to keep it on the 10.1.1.0 network and pass through Building B's core switch with vlans and static routing (Building B is on, say, 10.50.0.0 network) and across the VPN to talk to other 10.1.1.0 resources, or is it going to be easier to re-IP everything I am moving over and let the existing routing handle it? We're trying not to do that because a lot of their network shortcuts the users have are coded to the IPs and not DNS names. Which is silly, yes, I know. \n Looking for advice as to what the \"best\" thing to do would be. And yes, I realize that hiring a networking professional is the Best thing to do, but there is no money in the budget for that. I'm going to have to figure this one out.

I'm assuming as LibreNMS identifies the Juniper as a Juniper but the Adva as a Generic Device this is why I see this difference.\n I have checked the definition and discovery files within Libre and Yaml files do exist for measuring the TX and RX of Adva_FSP150 ports. I took the OIDs being used in this file and set them up as custom OIDs in libre with Gauge selected and dbm as my unit, I do see graphs under customer OIDs but no data being pulled. When I created the customer OIDs I ran a test which said value returned & successful.\n I think my next step will be downloading a MIB browser and checking to ensure the OIDs I have from the YAML file are correct.\n If anyone can point me in the right direction it would be most appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/LamboItalia666  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use this for eBGP and with the routing table nearing 1 million routes we need to either start filtering routes or preferably replacing them with hardware which can cope with much more routes. \n As part of this upgrade we are also looking to increase the transit links from 10Gb links to 100Gb links as well as any uplinks to our core. \n At the moment we have several transits coming in so we want to look at potentially having two transits per router so that's 2 x 100Gb and then we also want dual uplinks for reslience so 4 x 100Gb in total. \n Unfortunately this takes the C8500-12X4QX out of the picture as it won't support 4 x 100Gb links. 2 x 100Gb + 1 40Gb would be fine but not more than 240Gb in enabled links. \n So the next model up would be the C8500-20x6C.

          "description": "Seems like all hell broke loose today. I have a fleet of users with ubuntu linux laptops (ranges from 18.04 - 22.04) that have been on GlobalProtect for a while now. We included 6.0.4.something in our internal repo and installing the GP_UI package is part of our standard ubuntu image. LDAP auth on the backend because Palo/OpenConnect and SAML have been a moving disaster for years...\n Today, a huge uptick in users reporting that GP client is failing a FIPS initialization. No changes to the portal or gateways, and my environment is not FIPS. Windows clients are still fine, only linux users are getting the error as of today.\n The workaround is to remove and re-install the package, and is working for these users. I was wondering if anyone else with Palo Alto GlobalProtect has seen a notable increase in users with FIPS init failure errors.\n I have opened a case with Palo as well as collected user debug logs. But, because linux has never been a priority for Palo, I'm not holding my breath. This will probably turn in to a post about how PaloAlto should drop linux all together, but for now, I'd like to find out WHY? Did Ubuntu depreciate a SSL version that PanGP uses?\n    submitted by    /u/skynet_watches_me_p  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are directly connected\n  \nSome further debugging:\n  \nI can see the Adjacency process begin and the DBD packets transmit \n I can see the VlXX OUT to the PA \n I can see the VlXX IN from the PA \n OUT packet len:1412 \n MTU on the router interface is 1500, verified by ping sweep \n I can see the packets retransmit until they hit 25 where it is killed due to excessive retransmission \n IN packets still come but are ignored for a timer until process repeats\n  \nSo that size 1412 shouldn't get fragmented correct? \n One other thing I noticed is that on the HA Pair, all the Vlan interfaces are setup HSRP, except the one facing the PAs. For whatever reason, those vlan interfaces are setup separate i.e. VlanXX x.x.x.1 and x.x.x.2 with no standby... \n oddly after the Neighbor exchange goes down, I see a new election between the two devices but using other HSRP Vlan interfaces, but over the OSPF VlanXX already in process. This setup seems really odd to me? Could it cause issues?\n It's been a while since I went really deep into OSPF troubleshooting so I'm at a little bit of a loss of where to go next.

The Telonika has two SIM WAN interfaces (one EE, one O2), both interfaces are set to passthrough mode and the UDM Pro is set to DHCP for on it's WAN interface. \n In bridge mode, the Teltonika is no longer accessible (as expected) however, the UDM Pro also does not get the WAN IP address and says that there is no internet connection.\n In passthrough mode the Teltonika is still accessible/ manageable through it's remote management system (as expected), the UDM Pro is adoptable onto the Unifi system and can be remotely managed. However, it's WAN IP address in the Unifi console is a private 192.168.1.x IP address and not the WAN IP the Teltonika has. Laptops connected to the UDM Pro also have no WAN connectivity even though the UDM can get firmware updates and be remotely managed.\n Where am I going wrong? Why does the UDM Pro have some connectivity in pass through mode but absolutely zero in bridge mode? \n Is it CGNAT causing the issue? Is it a NAT or firewall issue on the Teltonika?

They have performed well for us over the years. Now I see that the Cisco Small Business (i.e., Linksys-heritage) line is now no longer being produced, and now it's the \"Cisco Business\" line for SME networking. Looks like the \"Cisco Business 350-24XT Managed Switch\" would be the closest model as compared to what we've bought in the past; I have a few questions...\n 1) Is the NOS closer to Cisco IOS than the CSB line was (that was \"IOS-like\" but had quite a few different commands, etc.) 2) There's no \"DNA\" license BS with this line? 3) Are there other good choices for a 24-port 10GbT switches out there? We have been swinging our switching over to Juniper, but they don't have a good/lower-cost 24-ports of 10GbT model out there from what I can tell... \n (And also, I know 10GbT is kind of a legacy port type vs SFP+, but that's what all their servers have in the location we're buying for, and what the admin staff there knows...)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/wdennis  \n [link]   [comments]",

Apparently, this Small school has to have an internal DNS server to direct them to our website using the internal IP's. This is for all the students and everyone in every subnet. And I asked why they just don't use the public IP if it's accessible. Well, the answer was simple. You cannot access any of the internal websites from the inside using the public IP address. I thought that was strange. \n I did a basic traceroute to the website and yep, it stops on our Palo Alto firewall. It's due to an Age out/incomplete which I'm sure is due to the Virtual router in the firewall not knowing where to send the traffic. \n However, I'm not sure how this should be done. \n Do I just implement a routing rule that anyone coming to the firewall internally asks for the public IP address of our website to redirect them back through the same interface? \n Baically the Default Gateway from the Core Switch has 1 interface connected to the Palo as the next hop that connects that interface to the router, then that router has a next hop for all traffic to our actual router. \n So \n Core Switch 10.0.0.1 -> 10.0.0.2 Palo Alto Vr Router -PublicIP interface. 1 -> Public IP interface Physical Router -> The internet. \n To be clear yes the Firewall has an interface with a public IP address that we own that hops to the router with also a Public IP address that we own and then to the internet.\n    submitted by    /u/jdbrav  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I try to re-issue the command the help menu will then SAY that manual is an option, but if I try it I get told the name is already in use.\n The other issue has to do with the xconnect command on the interface. The docs I'm reading have you issue the xconnect name with the VFI, and that's also not an option: The only option is the IP of the neigbor. Maybe if I configure the VFI manually and actually get the \"vpn id\" option into the VFI it'll allow me to attach it with xconnect?

There would be an incredible cost saving potential by switching to Fortinet, but one of the security architects (who's a PA fan and is against the change) argues that managing a large rule set on Fortinet would be highly disruptive. He's claiming that companies on Fortinet don't have more than 500 rules to manage. How many rules do you have in your Fortigates, and how do you perceive managing those in comparison to Palo Alto?\n r/pabechan was kind enough to provide the following command with which rules can be counted: show firewall policy | grep -c \"edit\"\n We have…",

This will be my first time doing a configuration like this solo as our engineer is no longer with us, I appreciate any help/advice \n We run a two-tier hierarchy design. We'll have 1 Core switch along with a 5 stack for access switches. This will be for a small(ish) branch location, so not looking to go all out. \n What would be the best way to uplink the access stack to the Core? \n Looking though what our old engineer did, he would use the first two ports on the stack commander to use as uplinks to the Core.\n Would that be the best option, or do we have a point of failure if that stack commander goes down? \n I'm thinking of using 1 port ( or two?) from each switch in the stack to use as an uplink to the Core. Is this silly/over kill? Planning on configuring them all into 1 LAG. ( ex. 1/1/1, 2/1/1, 3/1/1, etc. into LAG ID 1).\n Also, they're looking at getting a 24 port core opposed to a 48. Technically, if I use 1 port on each switch for uplinks I should only need ~16 ports, ~20 if if I go with two per switch. \n Is there something I'm not thinking of that could cause issues down the line? Our current Core's are all 48 ports, though the old admin would use the extra ports as Access, which I do not plan on doing.\n    submitted by    /u/CorrectExcuse2547  \n [link]   [comments]",

Three switches in a stack in one building with our ISP routers, two switches in a stack in our other building. A 10G fiber uplink connects the switch stacks between buildings.\n We have a VOIP Vlan set to Vlan 100. Most user access ports have both the VOIP Vlan and general data VLAN (200) configured. Ex:\n interface GigabitEthernet1/0/3 switchport access vlan 200 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 100 spanning-tree portfast \n Our phones are older Polycom devices, not Cisco.\n I've read up on Cisco Auto QoS, but I've also read it's not the most efficient way of implementing QoS. Especially in an environment that isn't using Cisco phones. I started a support case with Cisco, but they just sent me the Auto QoS documentation I already have...\n Can anyone help me understand what should be done here?

Consider the topology shown in which two hosts A and B are sending packets to D through router R. \n The bottleneck link in the path from R to D runs at 10 MB/s (i.e. 10 Megabytes per second). The RTTs from A to D and B to D are 100 ms. Assume that both A and B can\n communicate with R instantaneously and with arbitrarily large rate. Assume that each packet has a length of 1250 bytes and the buffer on router R can hold 200\n packets.\n Suppose that at time t = 0, host A has a congestion window of 999 packets, B has a congestion window of 0, and R’s buffer is empty. You should assume that packet\n drops are always experienced by the flow with more packets in flight. You should assume that each flow updates its congestion window after each RTT, decreasing it if\n any packet was dropped, and increasing it otherwise.\n AIMD: We first consider the evolution of the system when each flow is governed by AIMD, in which the congestion window grows by being incremented and shrinks by\n being halved (rounding down). In roundtrips 0 through 3, the system evolves as shown in the table below with host A exceeding the given congestion window size and\n accordingly reducing CWND to half in the next iteration. \n Now, suppose that instead we are using an AIAD protocol. In this case, every drop decreases the congestion window by 5 packets (to a minimum of 1 packet) instead\n of halving the congestion window. What is the congestion windows size of host A at t = 300 RTTs? Give your answer in packets. \n The solution states, it should be 300 but I do not understand why and there is nothing else provided.\n ​\n Please help!\n    submitted by    /u/FrainBreez_Tv  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Router is in front so the structure is ISP - Router - DNS - Firewall - Internal Network. \n This external DNS keeps the Host and only Host A files that lets the internet know that website A is IP whatever for the college. \n I believe the DNS servers forward the traffic to Quad9 or something like that, not sure why, but if some one can assist to the reason, I'm sure its a verification method or something to proof that we are the actual college we are advertising or to tell other larger DNS providers know who we are if some one form another state tries to reach our website. \n So on to my question. Is there a better way? I would like to move our records off site to something like cloud flair. However I set up a meeting with them and they said the minimum they covered was for websites that hit 1 million hits per month. Obviously its a community college in a rural area so we get around 17,000 hits. Then they wanted $20,000 a year. \n Now I was trying to keep my cool, but choking inside, so I didn't get a chance to clarify, but I think they thought I wanted some of the premium features and such when really I just wanted to host A records so we had a cloud DNS and if that's just a free thing or if we have to pay a fee. I think it was confusion because the prices on the website did not match up to what they were telling me. \n Can any one clarify if Cloud Flair is free to host records and all I have to do is just verify that we are who we say we are? \n or really any better solution to external DNS hosting or is it fine the way we have it set up?\n    submitted by    /u/jdbrav  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m a Network Administrator in the Marine Corps with 7ish years of experience and debating on leaving once my contract is up in a couple of years because I don’t want to move around anymore. I’m just worried I’m not going to enjoy what I do once I get out because currently I get to work on a lot of equipment and it’s honestly a lot of fun. I’m also curious if anyone has a role/job somewhat similar to what I do? For instance, at a typical training exercise I get to setup an equipment string supporting about 50-200 users which includes a Satellite Transmissions System or fiber connection and connect it to my router which connects via DMVPN to a NOC and pull services from there. I also get to setup/configure all switches to other offices (tents) to end devices and some encryption equipment and VoIP thrown in there as well. Usually it’s me and 1-2 other people doing all of this and we get a lot of time configuring which I enjoy. So I guess I’m just curious if anyone gets exposed to a lot of different equipment or do you mainly stick to a specific area of configuration?

The challenge we are having is we need to route are usable block of /27 to different WAN /29 address on two firewalls.\n Comcast has given us\n P2P IP:xxx.xxx.xxx.232/29 Gateway (.233) Comcast router Customer Layer 3 (.234)Customer Useable IP’s: xxx.xxx.xxx.235 – xxx.xxx.xxx.238\n and we have Usable EDI Static Range: yyy.yyy.yyy.225-.254 and this is 255.255.255.224 or /27\n I think that Comcast sends our Usable range to the xxx.xxx.xxx.234 address. \n What I have tried is to assign the .234 to a VLAN on our Dell N4000 switch with routing enabled. Then I assigned .235 and .236 to WAN interface on each firewall.\n Our issue comes when trying to setup a route in the table to send yyy.yyy.yyy.226 to the .235 ip. We are going to have to send different usable to the different firewalls. The switch complains that the rout is invalid, which makes sense since its a different network.\n Lots of people suggest getting an EdgeRouter X, would that let me do this?\n Any suggestions on getting our switch to do this type of routing?\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ArkhonMSP  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I have recently been trying to find out a deep dive into what exactly networking ports are. This is regarding TCP and UDP ports.\n Whenever I search what exactly are networking ports, I see explanations about how they are a way to identify a service. \n I have not seen explanations on how this is achieved.\n When a server receives a request on port 22, the TCP/IP stack inspects the destination port, and sees the number 22 there. Is the TCP/IP stack configured in such a way that each port number must be associated with a certain service, like if the number is 22, then forward the request to the sshd service?\n After the TCP/IP stack inspects the port number, will it forward the request to the relevant service - sshd in this case?\n I have thought of ports as \"gates\" to remotely access a service. Each service has its own PID, but this PID stays local, so ports are a way to access these services remotely. We won't be able to remotely access the service by its PID. But we can access the service if there is a TCP/IP stack that does the forwarding of request based on the destination port number?\n The questions above are just my own explanation of how ports are bound to services, and how the TCP/IP stack assists in forwarding the request to the relevant service. If anybody has knowledge in this, it would be great for someone to share it.\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/arthu_sp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there a way to turn that down or off?\n EDIT: I have eve-ng pro 5.0.1-20, it's recently installed.

This partially helped my problem, I noticed slightly less disk IO, but there was still a lot. It maybe decreased things by 10-25%. But the overall disk usage will not continually climb from the /var/lib/mysql/binlog.xxxxxx files.\n iotop showed this yet: 567481 be/4 mysql 0.00 B/s 551.38 K/s ?unavailable? mysqld [ib_pg_flush_co]\n ib_pg_flush_co was still writing a lot. So I did an strace of that process and it was doing io_submit about once a second. I just happened to google the very last option in the mysqld.cnf file \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2\". A quick google suggests that it forces a write cycle once a second.\n  \n edited \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2\" from 2 to 1 (the default), and restarted mysql again.\n  \nEDIT2: This only worked temporarily.

          "description": "I'm trying to setup LLDP on my Cisco 9300 switches to allow my Poly phones to determine their location for E911 on Zoom. I have only used CDP, and with the voice vlan, the phones figure out what vlan they need to be, and life's great. But, when I try to dial 933 to verify the more granular E911 location, it can't seem to sort out the MAC address of the switch it's connected to so it can be more precise.\n So far, I ran lldp run on the switch, and it seems to now be on. If I run show lldp neighbors, I get all the phones, APs, and other junk on the switch. But, the phone still doesn't seem to know what's going on. Running LDWin on a client machine to read the LLDP packets doesn't yield any results either. Either I'm getting erroneous results, or LLDP isn't configured correctly.\n Looking at the Cisco documentation, it looks like I may need to run lldp transmit and lldp receive on the specific interfaces, but that hasn't gotten me anywhere either. Oddly enough, the commands do not error out, but if I show the running config for the interface, those commands don't show up in the config. At the bottom of the post is the current interface config.\n I'm certain I'm missing something simple and obvious, but this is kicking my butt.\n Port config:\n switchport access vlan 10 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 90 authentication event fail action authorize vlan 64 authentication event server dead action authorize vlan 64 authentication event no-response action authorize vlan 64 authentication event server alive action reinitialize authentication host-mode multi-domain authentication port-control auto authentication periodic authentication violation replace mab dot1x pae authenticator dot1x timeout quiet-period 15 dot1x timeout tx-period 10 spanning-tree portfast spanning-tree bpduguard enable \n    submitted by    /u/smalltimesysadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "First, I inherited this nightmare, it isn’t my creation. I’m just tasked with making this whole thing work and so far I’m at an almost complete loss on the best way to segment this mess. It’s a fairly large subnet class c /21 with everything (and I do mean everything) on a single network. One of the biggest hurdles that I’ve had is diagnosing where the current loops are due to the Unifi system meshing (if meshing is turned off, nothing works which tells me it wasn’t designed correctly to begin with). So I’m trying to come up with a new design that will use what I’ve been given (they went building to building instead of each building back to the core due to the costs for horizontal boring). I’ve got two actual routers (Cisco) and some newer Catalyst 9200’s which are capable of full L3 routing (full meaning they can use an actual routing protocol and not just static). \n My first thought is to segment out each building with it’s own network and VLAN but I am at a loss on making it so everything can still get to everything (this is a live production/manufacturing facility so they cannot go down).The only way to really isolate the loops that remain (this network grew at rapid speed over about 20 years - things just kept being added on and not properly tracked) is to attempt to use the Catalyst devices as “border routers”. I’ve been working in this field for over 20 years and I can honestly say, this is the first network that hasn’t been a standard full mesh or hub and spoke design. So I’m reaching out to the wise folks on here to see if I’m going about this the right way or if perhaps someone out there has experience with such a thing and can give me some pointers. I’ve been removing every hub/non managed switch I can find as I come across them because they seem to quite literally be everywhere lol along with documenting how everything actually connects for future reference.\n    submitted by    /u/Corsoboundheart  \n [link]   [comments]",

Catalyst core, but still trunking is working for everything and there are very few problems (except Playstations. FU Playstations). \n But we have these CBORD devices that handle Student Payments (at Soda Machines, et al) and Card Swipy devices for CheckIn type things. When plugged into the Catalyst they work just fine. No PoE needed and they pull their reserved IP no problem. Can see it on the Catalyst CLI, can Ping it, everything is great. \n Swap that plug to a Meraki switch and the port DOESN'T EVEN ACTIVATE. No link lights, nothing. As far as Meraki is telling me there is no device plugged into that port. I've tried multiple ports on multiple switches now - same issue. Works on Catalyst just fine, Meraki doesn't want anything to do with it. The VLAN in use is one of the most widely used VLANs but I still went up and down the line to verify connectivity. \n Has anyone ever encountered anything like this?\n    submitted by    /u/GreenChileEnchiladas  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m conducting an experiment for my studies where I am measuring routing protocol convergence performance in a simulated and real hardware environment. \n I am struggling to make sense of how to calculate the convergence itself. Do I ping the host on the other end of the network continuously, and then shutdown an interface and time a change or do I simulate a data packet through Cisco simulation during which I shutdown the port to see how the routing protocol reacts?\n For my simulated part I am using the CPT simulator. For my real hardware I plan on using a Wireshark. Has anyone any idea how to measure the convergence times?

I have enjoyed them both greatly but at the moment would choose EVE-NG.\n Right now I have a MacBook so virtualisation is not really an option for me since it is Silicon/ARM based. Google Cloud is too expensive for the amount of CPUs and RAM I need for a good lab (>24vCPU and 48RAM, also the resources are not always available in zones which is really frustrating). I could just buy a used bare-metal server for my virtualisation but I am not sure I will have room for it but it is an option I am considering.\n I need the to emulate different vendors so CML is not an option for me as well.\n Could you suggest the most practical and least expensive way to setup a lab?\n What has your experience been with it?

All other clients (including the server 2019 backup domain controller) can ping the Mikrotik.\n A tracert to the switch from the PDC server shows no connectivity, however the server is reachable from other clients connected to the switch.\n Tracing route to mt [192.168.x.y]\n over a maximum of 30 hops:\n 1 * * * Request timed out.\n 2 * * * Request timed out.\n 3 * * * Request timed out.\n Thus far I have:\n  \nRebooted the Mikrotik\n Rebooted the server in question (PDC)\n Changed ethernet cables\n Changed port the PDC is connected to on the Mikrotik to a port that another server 2019 instance was able to successfully ping from\n Tested ping from all other clients on the subnet\n Verified server IP is part of the same subnet as the switch IP.\n Disabled the windows firewall - had no impact\n  \nThe PDC is directly connected to the switch. I'm able to ping the gateway on the other side of the switch, and am able to ping all clients connected to the switch.\n Network topology is quite simple. All clients connected to the Mikrotik, and a single router upstream connected to the modem.\n Any thoughts on how to re-establish pings from this server? I have a monitoring app that reports uptime from this server (I know...I know...shouldn't be on a PDC), and right now it is reporting the switch is down. This started yesterday. Previous to that there were no issues. No changes to the PDC have been made, which makes this even more confusing.\n Thanks everyone,\n Cal.\n    submitted by    /u/calvadosboulard  \n [link]   [comments]",

RP ports are connected back to back and TE0/1/0 from each WLC are connected to the core switch.\n When I disconnect the f.o. port from the active controller the other one takes control, and that's fine. The former active controller, however, have to reboot itself before completing the active to standby transistion (don't know why it needs to reboot but that's the way Cisco decided...): if I reconnect the fiber cable BEFORE the unit is rebooted, it will completely freeze. No output whatsoever on the console and the box is completely dead until I disconnect and reconnect the power cable.\n Has anyone seen this behaviour?\n Bye, Dario\n    submitted by    /u/draven_76  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know NAC is the solution but our company is impotent and unable to sort out the management policy side of things to actually implement it. In the meantime I am scanning our network with various tools I have and kicking off devices that break the current policies I am allowed to enforce. Have been using Zenmap on Mac but was wondering if there was a better version or option out there that is free/open source? Perhaps something that can be installed on a server and present scans or reports in a nicer way? We have some other tools that can fingerprint but they mostly rely on DHCP relay to get info so are only useful for DHCP devices and don't see stuff on static IPs. Any suggestions of tools welcome. I appreciate this isn't cyber security sub but I am a network engineer and looking at ultimately discovering as many of these devices as possible to boot them off until management pulls their fingers out and allows us to implement NAC.

When I do a \"show interface status\", I do not see the 1 gig ports, only the 10 gig ports.\n    submitted by    /u/GC_Player  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all, got a bit of a strange situation I stumbled upon. For reference this post deals with two separate sites that are unable to communicate with one another (or correctly at least). For simplicity I'm going to refer to them as Site A and Site B and the majority of the IT team including myself works at a different branch from the two.\n I first became aware of the issue when a member of the helpdesk team brought up that Site A can't communicate with Site B. Surface level this appeared to be true as he had run ping tests from the DC at Site A to the gateway at Site B receiving \"Request timed out.\" response. However, Site B can ping Site A without issue... I assumed that this is some sort of blocking issue with one of the FortiGate's since one of the sites can send ICMP echo packets it wouldn't be a routing issue. But I see nothing related to the ping tests shown in the logs on Site A or Site B's FortiGate. I would run a pcap but the deployed models do not have onboard memory unfortunately.\n Then it started to get a bit confusing, I ran a trace route from a VM at Site A to Site B and it completed without issue. The sequence of hops was as follows: Site A VM -> Site A Layer 3 Switch -> Site A FortiGate -> Site B FortiGate -> Site B Layer 3 Switch -> destination IP.\n Out of curiosity I ran a perpetual ping test from Site A to Site B for 10~ minutes and shockingly saw a couple successful ping attempts among all the \"Request timed out.\" responses (98% loss for reference). Site A is also able to communicate with all of our other sites without issue.\n Any advice or tips for this? This one is starting to make my head spin and I feel I may be missing something obvious.\n Edit: Forgot to mention - Site B responds to ping from all of our other sites without issue.\n    submitted by    /u/Happy-Drive9316  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since then we have migrated to their hybrid drive solution with an expensive ,windows server running the server software and a windows plugin on each computer serving files from the cloud or the server, depending on location. The search path for all files remain the same. A great server solution with hardware costs remainso nothing. Useful and straightforward, in theory.\n In reality: The service is expensive since we have a lot of server data (around 10TB) and the hybrid software makes the work in our CAD software very slow since each work session loads hundreds of files and the hybrid software/server solution becomes incredibly slow. In reality, we need to sync all folders locally even when we are on our LAN with a server.\n As an administrator without any professional knowledge of IT systems, it is near impossible for me to find other alternatives and compare the pricing and functionality.

I will preface this with I have been in DevOps for 2 years and am comfortable in AWS, however networking in general is not a strong point in any way, so if this is dumb - I can take it. \n We have a project which requires a site-to-site VPN from our AWS VPC to a customer who is running Cisco ASA. I have had the VPN set up in various ways because they keep changing requirements. However that latest requirement I am not sure how to handle. \n Their statement is - \"We look for interesting traffic on our router and when it finds it, it creates the tunnel and closes it when no longer used\". So it sounds like a tunnel on-demand thing? Now, the only information we have are the endpoints in their network which we access through the tunnel. How do we send \"interesting\" traffic for them to create the tunnel if we need the tunnel to send our traffic? \n I keep thinking that they didn't give us an important piece of information - like this magical endpoint. Or are we supposed to initiate the tunnel? It seems like a very chicken-and-egg situation that I am not able to wrap my head around. \n As I said - networking neophyte here but desperately looking for some understanding of what he is talking about.

We built a NetMotion Secure Access server on our server VLAN (10.1.4.0), with the intent of having VPN clients reach out to a DHCP server and get an IP from a newly created 10.1.74.0/24 range. However, I'm trying to conceptualize how this would work with regards to routing and our firewalls. A couple of notes:\n  \nNetMotion, as far as I know, has no configurable static routing/VLAN assignment/etc\n In order for clients to get an IP from the desired range, we give the server an IP to use from it (10.1.74.5). The server sends DHCP requests using that address\n  \nWith that said, I suppose my question two-fold:\n  \nHow exactly would that work? If our firewall sees packets from the 10.1.74.0 subnet coming in on the server VLAN, it will block them, correct? Is there a logical way to allow access without creating a bunch of weird access policies?\n How do we configure routes for traffic destined for the VPN subnet? Would it be as simple as creating a static route that points to the server's IP? Any past experience I've had with VPN involved them living on firewalls that did all of our routing, so it seems foreign doing things this way.\n  \nAny thoughts you folks have would be appreciated.

Owner is kind of down, Co-owner who is 20 years younger is less down and thinks its absolutely not worth it and will barely impact our workflow. \n I've done a rough estimate on the plugs we actually use in the building, about 700' worth of cable so we'd buy a 1000' spool. My concern is the owners wife wants the building to be usable for the next person if they ever sell. When they built the place in 2006, they ran the Cat5 IN THE WALL using the \"Home Run\" method, where they drilled holes in every.. 2x4... and pulled the ethernet cable through. The owner is pretty sure they also stapled them to the 2x4s every so often. So there is no way of pulling them out. I think we reuse the current ethernet outlet spot, ditch the cable in the wall, and back in the \"network closet\" we shove the cat 5 cable in the wall and patch the drywall. Unless there is another use for Cat5 I'm not aware of that would be a good reason to get a dual plug and actually have both and make both usable. That would kind of solve both issues. Anyone have any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/Unlucky-Sherbert-873  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Multi Gig Small Office recommendations\n Hi Networking! I’m primarily an AV engineer but a facility I work with is looking to expand their 10 gig network. It’s a small office, less than 50 users (currently somewhere around 20 but may expand in the next few years), with several file servers on premise and a couple internet accessible services (behind reverse proxy through Argo tunnel). \n What we need: -10GBe access layer to the workstations. -high reliability -Ability to VLAN/ACL various devices for access to various file servers. So basically, nothing unmanaged. -Likely higher throughput trunks between servers and switches, and between switches. All our servers are equipped with 4x10gbe. Probably a good implementation of LACP and STP. -that’s it!\n What we would like: -centralized-ish management, ability to manage with APs would be a huge bonus. \n What we don’t really need: -POE\n Currently I run Meraki at my office, and I think this would be perfect but the cost of getting several MS355-24X (otherwise a perfect switch) might be prohibitive, and the license would compound that. I also run an Aruba Instant On network (automod removed my post for saying where), and their 1960 12XGT looks very interesting and priced very well, but I haven’t used any of their multi gig offerings. I like the ability to integrate with their wifi6 APs at a great price point too. Also highly considering the Cisco CBS 350 12XT and CBS 350 24XT. \n Just looking for opinions and thoughts!

Client of mine has an office for creative marketing and they have about 30 people in at a time using various applications(social media,Dropbox,zoom,google meets) they have a shared gigabit connection from isp and dedicated ethernet is not an option unfortunately. They are hard set on keeping the sonicwall and they haven’t been able to find anyone willing to configure it properly for them so I offered to check it out. The issue they are having is during peak time is buffering,web pages not loading etc… I took a look into there sonicwall and there is no bandwidth management configured at all. Just one CFS rule for default content filtering. My question is there a straight forward way to set up bandwidth profiles or a global rule to limit bandwidth for each user? My guess is out of the 30 users a few are uploading heavily to Dropbox and saturating the circuit.\n    submitted by    /u/whatsareddit23  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I've been thinking about expanding this to include more L1 Information that easily gets lost in Diagrams and Spreadsheets.\n Some ideas:\n  \nFibre patch lead connector type (e.g. lc/sc)\n Fibre patch lead tip (APC/UPC) [Optional, default would be UPC]\n Patch lead length (e.g. 3m)\n Horizontal Fibre type (e.g. om3, os2)\n Patch Panel location (e.g. <RACKID>-#RU)\n  \nThe description would look something like this:\n <hostname> Uplink - pl=lc-sc-om4, tip=upc-upc, len=3m, hz=om3, loc=BB1-RU21 \n From the above, I can quickly tell that there is a 3m LC/SC OM4 UPC patch lead connected from $this device to BB1-RU21 which is a Horizontal run of OM3. \n This could also be collapsed into a shorter form like:\n <hostname> Uplink - pl=lc-sc-upc-upc-3m-om4, hz=om3, loc=BB1-RU21 \n Does anyone think this is overloading the description of an Interface with excessive L1 Information? Should we be pulling this out into something like Netbox (We currently have no roadmap for Netbox). Or should be collapsed down into a Link ID and stored outside of the device configuration?\n Benefits I see:\n  \nInformation is close to the hardware, less likely chance of being sprawled into Documentation that doesn't get an update\n \nThis information is presented directly in our alerts when the link goes down\n \nNo need to bring multiple different Patch-Leads to a job if the link goes down. Correct leads and connectors, each time.\n \n If you're doing this, would you mind sharing your standard?\n    submitted by    /u/pingdrop  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We have a school that is occasionally maxing out a 1Gb connection from their ISP. ISP tells us that two 1Gb connections will be significantly more affordable than the single 2Gb connection they offer. This initially seemed great because we have 1 group of traffic we want to use one of the connections and 1 group of traffic we want to use the other connection. ISP is using GPON and I suspect they will give me an IP address for the second connection that is in the same subnet as the IP for the first connection and thus would have the same gateway. Most PBR scenarios I've seen set the next-hop IP based on the source network, but in this case the next-hop IP would be the same for both connections. Firewall at school is an ASA 5516-X. I initially preferred to use just a single firewall, but I do have some extra 5506-X I could deploy if necessary, recognizing the 5506-X won't do the full 1Gb. I'm not completely familiar with GPON, but perhaps I could request the second connection have an IP in a different subnet? \n Thinking a bit further, the school ASA in question currently has a VPN tunnel back to the datacenter ASA. I assume the school ASA is not going to establish a VPN tunnel to the datacenter from both of its IP Addresses, so I assume this is where a default route would come in and all traffic from both school subnets that need to traverse VPN tunnel would use the default route?\n    submitted by    /u/yllw98stng  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each provider has a 10 Gbps capacity, and are received on a switch, on SFP+ ports, except one of them that is connected to a QSFP+ port. For the BGP peering, will only accept a default route from each of the providers, i.e., we're not interested in Full-BGP support, the BGP peerings are there so that we can send a couple of IPv4 and IPv6 routes. For internal routing, we have an OSPF networtk with a routing table with about 7000 routes at the backbone.\n The thing is, our Mikrotik CCR1072 edge router is not scaling well, and we're planning on getting much more bandwidth on a couple of months. The current throughput is around 15 Gbps, and we're estimating that we will double it before july. \n I'm thinking of getting a L3 Switch with 40G/100G uplink that could connect to the edge switch, and manage the 3 peerings on this new switch (as a BGP edge router), so it will also handle the traffic. What L3 switch would you guys you recommend? I'd like a switch that could handle, say, 80 Gbps of routing? Considering the 3 peerings, and the 7000 OSPF routes.\n We're also evaluating buying a new router, but Cisco and Juniper routers are basically too expensive right now, and checking out FS.COM I saw a couple of switches that could probably do the job, like this bare metal switch https://www.fs.com/products/69226.html. \n Do you have any recommendations at a $10k-$15k budget?\n    submitted by    /u/engineering_hugo  \n [link]   [comments]",

The one we are having issues with is VLAN 1/Subnet 72, which has inverters 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 8.1, 8.2, 9.1, 9.2.\n On December 16th, we had our first issue, where inverters 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 8.1, 8.2, 9…",

          "description": "I have a VLAN dedicated for equipment supplied by outside vendors that need internet access. All endpoints on this VLAN will be a device that will connect a VPN back to it's individual vendors home office to give them remote management access. \n Most of these devices come with a fairly well documented list of access requirements for the VPN to function. Meaning that the vendor has provided all the information needed to lock down the connection. This is great! But, to me, it is kind of silly to go to all the trouble of locking down 90% of these appliances if the other 10% are not well secured, get compromised, and end up allowing open access to everything else on that layer2 subnet. \n I already have the vlan/subnet locked down so that it has zero access to the internal network. But I would like to take it a step further by locking down layer2 communication in that vlan/subnet so that each endpoint can only communicate with the gateway (fortinet 80f) and outside internet. \n Rough breakdown of my hardware in place it as follows:\n Internet > Fortigate 80f > mdf-access - Cisco 3850 > core-switch - Cisco Nexus 3548P > idf-access - Cisco 3850 > Vendor Endpoints\n Internal network gateways live on the nexus 3548p which also handles the internal routing.\n Guest and isolated vlan/subnet gateways live on the fortigate. No routing other than sending traffic to the internet. On the switches, there is just the layer2 vlan configured, no layer3 svi. \n So, is configuring private vlans my best bet here? https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/a-quick-summarized-view-to-private-vlan-pvlan-x\n Or is there a better way to isolate layer2 endpoints? Am I overthinking this?\n Also, let me know if I left out any information that would be useful for a recommendation. \n ​\n Thank you for any thoughts or advice!\n    submitted by    /u/bigTractor  \n [link]   [comments]",

The main reason for purchasing is to use their CARE product which will allow us to automate STIG checking and filling out the STIG checklists for us, among other things.\n During this meeting the guy referenced anislble alot and said that NSO using a lot of ansible playbooks to do these checks. Even when he showed us the output of some of the checks, i noticed that it is the same output that I would get from ansible. Everything from what it prints down to even the color it prints in.\n So my question. Everything that NSO CARE does for checking STIGS (compliance checks, differences between golden configs and all other configs, filling out STIG checklists, etc.), could it all be done with ansible playbooks? I have some experience with ansible and python, and I have my own playbooks/scripts that do compliance checks, check differences between configs, tell me what STIG findings are open, etc. The only thing I really havn't figured out how to do yet that I really would like to be able to do is automate filling out the checklists. Not sure if thats possible with an ansible playbook or not.\n TLDR: Is Cisco NSO with CARE worth the cost, or can I just do everything with Ansible?\n    submitted by    /u/GC_Player  \n [link]   [comments]",

Both ranges are currently rout'able through the existing gateways but after the end of this week only y.y.y.0/24 will be available for us to use.\n The current problem we are facing is that we already setup everything in y.y.y.0/24 address space in advance (interface, gateway, nat, security policy etc), but there seems to be some issue with NAT overload (trusted to untrusted) rules and we are seeing the issues mostly with SIP and RTP traffic. The issue is that even if we have configured ip y.y.y.y on the untrusted/outside interface and have a NAT rule for outbound traffic (to use interface), the firewall is taking the old ip configured on the outside interface (x.x.x.x). Not sure why it's behaving like this for SIP and RTP but most of the other traffic is using the new IP (y.y.y.y). \n We verified if the traffic is hitting the correct policy using test and it's hitting the correct NAT rule and shows the correct translated address. But checking the active sessions using the show session commands shows it's not using the current interface ip but the old ip of the interface. We verified the output of the show session against the corresonding NAT rule and we can see the SIP/RTP sessions under that rule but using old ip as a translated source address.\n The firewall is on 8.1 version and upgrading is not an option right now as we are in a process of migrating the firewalls. Tried clearing the sessions, removing and re-adding the NAT rule, but this buggy behaviour exist. Should I disable SIP ALG/inspection and allow traffic through security policy?\n Apologies for the long post and any help is really appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/bobbythomastvm  \n [link]   [comments]",

For me, most DCs have around 50 switches. \n But, after everything is finished and we take a look in the EVPN table, we find that they can get pretty big. Sadly most customers want \"every vlan everywhere!!!11\" which certainly won't help with scalability. As we have to add a VLAN to 50 switches, even if it's only used on 2 switches. \n After we did dig a bit in scalability and how to minimize table entries (depending on BGP design obviously). We are not sure how big someone could scale a standard VXLAN EVPN Fabric. Someone told me \"around 400 switchs, then it gets janky\" another one said \"we have 2000 switches in a campus VXLAN EVPN fabric, everything is fine\". So, how far can we/you go? What are the limits?\n I'm not talking about the routing table of the switches, of course some switches will fill their tables earlier than others. But if you use switches with millions of possible entieries, where is the limit?\n I know already that the public clouds don't use a DC network like the ones we build. They have \"software\" on their servers for their fabric and don't have all that state in their network. It wouldn't scale that big.\n    submitted by    /u/onyx9  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think though, this bring up the matter of how much should I invest in deep learning, machine learning, AI if I stay on the network automation track?\n    submitted by    /u/Optimal_Leg638  \n [link]   [comments]",

Today the only visage left is Reddit and arguably Discord. More so, though, it seems the general attitude of everyone has changed from “Let’s discuss this, and I can help you clear up your confusion” to “I’m right, and watch me prove you wrong.” Sometimes this manifests itself as negative comments, but more often than not it’s downvotes.\n Now I don’t know about you guys, but I’m not on this sub for fake Internet points. Instead, I’d rather have meaningful conversations about networking, where I can potentially teach others about aspects of technology they don’t already know, and likewise, learn new things myself.

What differentiates them in terms of features and performance? They all seem to have the core capabilities of an NGFW: Packet Filtering (Layers 3 & 4), VPN, Stateful Inspection, Application Visibility & Control, Threat Intelligence, IPS.\n Relevant 3rd party benchmarks I'm looking at: Gartner and Cyber Ratings. Should these suffice? Which one should I prioritize? I've heard Cyber Ratings is more relevant since they actually test the hardware.\n Any other reliable sources that can help me evaluate and choose?\n I've heard Palo Alto is the gold standard, but is pricey (they reached out and said we can negotiate), and Fortinet is the most cost-effective and up-and-coming vendor. Is that true? \n I'm currently leaning towards Forcepoint, since they are making some compelling arguments. They seem to have the best Firewall performance. Some of the main points they mentioned about their NGFW's include: \n Best malicious signature detection, therefore best IPS/IDS. Apparently this is the most important metric to gauge a firewall's performance?\n Active-Active clustering for high availability \n Best in the market to protect against evasion attacks\n \n  \n​\n I would highly appreciate any and all insights based on your experiences and research!

          "description": "I have a Cisco Catalyst 2960X switch that has a single drop going to an inconvenient location. At the end of that single drop is an unmanaged, 8-port desktop gigabit switch. That switch is unmanaged, but passes tagged frames through it unmolested. There are six devices on that switch that don't know how to emit tagged frames themselves, and need to talk on the same VLAN. That's obvious - switchport access vlan 57 would do the trick.\n But there's one device there that needs to be on VLAN 69. It can emit tagged frames, so configuring the port like so would seem right: switchport mode trunk switchport trunk native vlan 57 switchport trunk allowed vlan 57,69 \n But, the conundrum is this: how do I keep devices other than the one that's meant to be talking on VLAN 69, from doing so on that port? It seems straightforward to use a MAC access-list, except that there doesn't seem to be a way to apply it only for frames tagged for VLAN 69. The devices on VLAN 57 are subject to change, so enumerating their MAC addresses is a giant pain.\n What I'd like is this - permit any host to send untagged frames, which end up on VLAN 57. Permit only one authorized host to send tagged frames; if they're tagged for anything but VLAN 69 then the allowed vlan config should take care of it. Is there a straightforward way to do this on a 2960x without either enumerating all the authorized devices for VLAN 57, using dot1x, or putting a managed switch down there?\n    submitted by    /u/jade_nekotenshi  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Q-in-Q tunnel strips out spanning tree packets. While I would remove a VLAN from the existing tunnel before adding it to the new link, I can't do that with the native VLAN 1, which would be present on both links and, without STP, would likely cause a loop.\n To further complicate things for me slightly, I'm running older Cisco kit at the first site (3850s at the core) and Ruckus at the second site (ICX 7650s) so configuration isn't just a copy/paste. Each site is its own spanning tree domain, so I'd be wanting to enable bpdufilter on the links anyway.\n Would setting the native VLAN on the new link to something other than default VLAN 1 solve this? Or should I bite the bullet, configure all the VLANs on the new link and simply shut down the old and enable the new, and be ready to switch back if it doesn't come up as expected? Or is there another approach? I'd prefer to do some more testing first, running the link as a trunk carrying a couple of test VLANs, but not causing a network loop is more important!\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ox-sjwk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Without making this question too complicated: I'm wondering if there are any benefits to PVLANs beyond them simply being easier to configure than tons of different VLANs. Obviously in the classic hotel room example, manually configuring hundreds of different VLANs would be a bit more tedious than throwing switchports into PVLANs, but is that it? Is there really any other valid purpose to PVLANs? The experts all seem to suggest that this is tied to layer 3 subnets but it's not like you can't have devices in different VLANs part of the same subnet as it is. As far as I'm aware, the only real purpose of 1:1 VLAN:subnet relationships is for better organization/consistency across L2 and L3. \n EDIT: Got my answer here.

However, my isp has me under a double NAT and doesn't allow me full network or router management. The only thing they can provide me is port forwarding the required port of the cam's ip.\n I know port forwarding an IP camera, specially an old model is a security concern, but since this is for eventual surveillance during specific hours or days and the camera would otherwise be off, how much of a risk could this pose? Is there any way to keep using this camera?\n Thanks for any help or suggestions!\n    submitted by    /u/Walafar  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the Xgspon is has started to be used, nokia has 25G pon.

The IPs of the cellular modems change frequently - within restarts or days - so having a trusted IP list in the access list won't work. Most of the services being hit from the NAT rule require some sort of authentication. However, this is for test engineers who have no reason to consider security. Along with that, they may be testing on an OS or services that have known vulnerabilities. \n I've been contemplating this for a few days and the only thing I can think of is to put the test VMs on a small private VLAN so their at least contained. On top of that, I figure I may as well add a list of trusted IPs based on the cellular network they are using to at least be somewhat explicit on the access list. However, with my ignorance of how their systems work, there is still the possibility of a bad actor exploiting some vulnerability and possibly getting some sort of foothold and/or company IP. This would be a very targeted attack, but I have to consider the possibility.\n Does anyone have any experience with supporting something like this or have a better idea on how to enable the engineers to get their jobs done while still keeping the company internal network secure along with any IP on the test systems?\n TL;DR: Engineers need to have cellular modems connect to systems on our internal network. My thought is a basic NAT rule allowing any outside connection to that IP:PORT for port forwarding to their systems which I put on a private VLAN.\n    submitted by    /u/BitteringAgent  \n [link]   [comments]",

SMB on the other hand works almost flawlessly though. Problem B) Every traffic from within the network actually doesnt seem to be steady and this behaves in a repeating pattern: it goes from fast to mediocre or even halts every few seconds goes back to full speed and then repeats this behavior after a a few seconds. It’s the same from outside the Network, downloading or uploading from/to the entire network: Client will actually see these interferences aswell.\n After everything I’ve tried I think I narrowed it down to UDP and probably one of the two switches in the network. IPerf between peers and/or NAS or other clients or servers: everything seems fine - except for UDP. Cant establish a connection. Netcat UDP works between all machines except one though : on that specific machine Netcat only works exactly ONCE and then loses (or closes?) the connection immediately. I had good NFS results with a test-share on the NAS when I explicitly disabled UDP + I don’t allow Sync - resulting in up to 1GB/s read and write to the NAS. (SMB is at about 600MB/s) MTU is 1500 everywhere. Turned off Auto-Negotiation and Flow Control everywhere. \n Any ideas what this could be?

Here are the results:\n ACI NOT Cisco - 4,344 \n Nexus Dashboard - 3 (All from Cisco)\n Arista CVP NOT Arista Networks - 4,145 \n NSX - 1,533 \n Apstra NOT Juniper Networks - 5 (3 of those were from \"Juniper Apstra\" so it's really 2 jobs)\n EVPN - 385\n VXLAN - 743 \n ​\n I feel like you all owe /u/bmcgahan an apology. Cisco is a vendor people love to hate on. Yes their licensing and certain marketing practices are despicable, but there seems to be a market out there for ACI, contrary to what people are saying. \n After this brief search, I plan to spend some time to learn more about the solution and see where the opportunities might be.\n Edit: Also to be fair and for context, Cisco is a behemoth of a marketing machine with many more feet on the ground when it comes to sales, so naturally their numbers are expected to be bigger.

          "description": "Sorry I'm going to be ranting a little bit, but perhaps we can also start a discussion.\n I recently had to work with a bunch of RJ45 connectors that had boots as shown in the picture:\n Awful boot\n And it was a somewhat frustrating experience. Not TOO bad, but I must say that is the dumbest connector boot design ever, and it's really popular for some reason.\n Here's why it's terrible. The flaps on the sides. I understand they are there to prevent the tab getting snagged on something. But they're not actually guaranteed to work for that because something can still technically get in between them and snag the tab.\n But by far the worst thing about them is that you cannot easily press the tab and release the connector. It's actually quite annoying, even when you figure out the best way to do it, you still can't quite get a good push on the tab and it often feels like you're scraping the connector as you're pulling the cable out.\n Every other design has realized this, so they have the anti-snag thing go over the tab so you can press on it directly and release the cable, also guaranteeing the tab will never get snagged. Easy, sensible, works. But whoever designed this boot was too stupid to realize this, did they even test their creation once? And then for some reason it caught on and is now quite a popular design.\n Am I missing something? It's terrible, right? I know I'm overreacting, but what are you gonna do... first world problems.\n Edit: Reading the comments, I guess I this is actually one of the nicer designs when you consider how god awful some of the other ones are, ending up under the tab or hardening over time... I just hate not being able to easily get my finger in between the flaps to press the tabs and now I see that it can be so much worse... LOL.

I took some time out to dabble in cybersecurity tool integrations, however the only time I was really happy in that role was working with the network shops on the customer side, helping them configure, troubleshoot, and sharing knowledge along the way. So I decided to make a move back into networking. The welcome was warm and I quickly found a new home.\n So my question for the field - is GNS3 still the hotness when it comes to network modeling and plain old CLI practice? I need to get smart on Cisco DC in a hurry, and already targeted CCNP DC since the new environment is heavy on Nexus 9k infrastructure with a sizeable SAN. All of the campus networks are Catalyst 9k.

Recently, my company replaced 2 of our network cabinets and tidied up our connections by pulling unused connections out of the cabinet and wrapping them in the ceiling.

One thing we want to still be able to do is use our network tester to plug in to a port in the facility to trace it back to the network port in case someone moves to a different location. How can I do this but still keep people from just plugging in and it working?

Long-story short, these devices transmit/access sensitive info and we'd like to make sure their traffic is handled as such. We are setting up a vendor VPN server that will encrypt traffic between those devices and the traffic's destination. The VPN configures an always-on virtual NIC and virtual IP on these devices; the assignment pool can be any of our choosing.\n Our firewall has a subinterface for VLAN 405, which is on a /30 network with the cellular provider's router. That then communicates with any devices on 405. My question is, if these devices now get fancy new virtual IPs from a completely different range (let's say 192.168.1.0), how will traffic flow be affected? Will I need to create a new VLAN and/or subinterface in addition to new access rules in order for traffic from these devices to continue to be allowed? Or can I just configure access rules to allow the new range on the existing subinterface?

For our local sites this has been fairly simple as we can enable P2P blocking for the group of APs and be done with it. Unfortunately for Flex Connect sites, this function only works on a per AP basis and is a known limitation. This means that a client on AP1 cannot talk to another client on AP1, but can talk to a client on AP2.\n I've been experimenting a bit with private Vlans as I have a theory that if the APs are in isolated Vlans then they cannot talk to each other and the P2P block should work for the APs themselves, but testing has been slow and there's doubts this could work for our environment on a larger scale. \n Curious to hear what solutions your teams have come up with to enable client isolation. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/SPNCER  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I posted here about a week ago regarding a design decision for a customer and got a lot of great feedback.\n Now, I been thinking about another aspect of the design and my brain won't let me understand the logic here, here is the design: https://imgur.com/gyI2ihY \n Network setup: \n  \n2 fortigates, HA active/passive. \n 2 switches, will form MLAG with the firewalls. Will also run VRRP and vPC between the switches.\n Three servers connected to both switches\n SVI:s (default gateways for the VLANs) will be terminated on the firewall\n Internet will terminate on the switches. \n Only one ISP circuit, they will handoff two ports from their wan switch, each physical cable will be connected to each switch. \n  \n​\n Now to my question, since the SVI/gateways for the servers will be terminated on the firewall, how will I then configure the VRRP on the switches? The way I've been configuring VRRP before, I always configured the SVI:s and VRRP on the same \"equipment\" (switch/router etc) if that makes sense.. \n So for example, let say we have vlan 200 and a subnet of: 10.200.10.0/24 and I want to configure VRRP on the switches:\n SW1:\n Interface vlan 200\n ip addr 10.200.10.1/24\n vrrp 1 ip 10.200.10.99\n vrrp 1 prio 120\n preempt\n etc... \n SW2:\n Interface vlan 200\n ip addr 10.200.10.2/24\n vrrp 1 ip 10.200.10.99\n preempt\n etc...\n Now, this is if the SVI:s would be terminated on the switches. But I would like to terminate the SVI:s on the firewall and not on the switch. Taking that approach (terminating SVI:s on the firewall): from the switch, I will just create a L2 VLAN and trunk it to the firewall. \n ​\n I know of course that I do not want to terminate the SVI:s on the firewall, I could just terminate the SVIs on the switch and then run VRRP on the switches as well, but I would like to know if what I ask is doable, if so, how and why? \n I could overthink this but please, help me to understand it. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/donutspro  \n [link]   [comments]",

Can anyone guide me which material I should get for my applications? The wiring will run in a drop ceiling and above a kitchen. Also I will probably have some short runs outside (maybe around 10-15ft) and we live in the midwest (USA) where it gets cold so do I need any specific type of cable material for that? Trying to stay in a budget so budget friendly options are appreciated but want to do it right.\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/bulls2030  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've worked on a couple of local ISPs now and realized neither of them have a proper way to store equipment passwords, usually it is just a spreadsheet with all equipment login and passwords. This approach poses a security risk, given that if this one document is leaked, the entire network is compromised. Another problem I've seen is that usually they just distribute the admin password to everyone working on the NOC, and so we've encountered a few people doing misconfiguration and also the need to change the master password once that employee leaves the ISP. I've thought about implementing a Radius based approach, where every user would get their own login and password, but I do not know of any \"radius manager\" (let's call it that). So, what is the approach used by your company, what are the recommendations and what are the pros and cons of each method?\n    submitted by    /u/BrunoBlanes  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just seeing a multitude of SYNs from the clients, and never any SYN+ACK from the server.\n We set a SPAN up directly on the server’s ports and see the SYNs egressing towards the server, and no SYN+ACK ingressing, we effectively proved traffic is making it all the way to the server, and the server is not responding to the traffic.\n After a while the ticket comes back to us saying the app owner had a call with the support vendor and they found nothing wrong and wanted the network checked for blocks.\n Same situation on second look, all SYNs no responses. This time we did some troubleshooting on the server itself and NETSTAT showed an anomaly. It showed ESTABLISHED connections with all of the clients trying to reach it, on the port they’re sending on…\n How is this possible? For NETSTAT to show ESTABLISHED on a TCP connection, it means there had to be a 3-way handshake, right?

I'd also then be responsible for creating and giving presentations about what our recommendations are, creating detailed designs and implementation plans and then be the primary technical POC during proof-of-concept implementations. There would be lots of client interaction, lots of face time, and at least 20% travel with the rest being fully remote. Lots of creating documentation & designs, and then sometimes assisting (at a high level) with implementation.\n All of this sounds great to me, at least on paper. It's the stuff that I love doing, without as much of the drudgery of day-to-day tickets. I spend my entire day already elbow-deep in this specific vendors products anyway, so if anything I'd have to go even deeper into their product offerings across the board.\n The compensation numbers being tossed about are . . . uh, generous to say the least.

I've completely turned off the firewall on both machines to see if thats the issue, and it didn't help. \n a \"powershell test-netconnection\" to the server on port 23 fails\n I've connected to his VPN using the same settings from my computer and I can telnet to the server just fine.\n I've connected to his VPN using the same settings from his old home computer and I can telnet to the server just fine.\n I've restarted and ran windows updates and it still doesn't work. I checked the firewall rules on the meraki and its set to allow all. There are some OLD 1:1 nat rules having to do with port 23 but that shouldn't have anything to do with a vpn connection.\n ​\n I'm stumped. I don't know why this machine wont work and a machine on the same home network works fine connecting the same way. I've spent 4 hours on this so I'm sure I've missed some things in this write up\n    submitted by    /u/ryancrazy1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did not setup the firewall but did setup the DHCP server.\n We have all our subnet/VLAN scopes imported to windows DHCP. For example, wired (20), wireless (30), security (50), etc. \n However, that leaves our APs. Whomever initially setup the firewall configured all the APs to the DHCP server on the Palo. \n What is the best practice in this scenario? Create a new sub interface/VLAN for the APs and migrate scope to windows DHCP? Put them on the wired Vlan? Or get all DHCP off the firewall and create a new scope just for APs?\n Perhaps the engineer setting up the FW was using the Palo dhcp until the new dhcp server was active?\n We would preferably don’t want the FW running dhcp.

The network diagram is here. When I try to connect to Wi-Fi it never obtains an IP address. I can, however, turn on the hotspot on my Pixel 6 Pro and it will connect. The hotspot is set for WPA2-Personal\n ​\n  \nThe FD150 supports WPA-AES, WPA-TKIP, and WPA2-AES. I’m not trying to use anything other than WP2-AES\n The WAPs support WPA2-Personal, WPA3-Personal, and WPA-Enterprise. I don’t have/want a RADIUS server, so enterprise is out. I’ve set the WAPs to use WPA2-Personal.\n My believe is that WPA2-Personal and WPA2-AES are the same thing. WPA2-Personal uses AES.\n I’m trying to connect the credit card machine to VLAN30. Other PCs using that VLAN via a different SSID, but same WAP have no problem obtaining an IP address and accessing the internet. I have tried the FD150 connecting to the same SSID as the other PCs – still doesn’t work.\n  \nI’m working on a method to Wireshark the Wi-Fi packets but finding an adapter that supports monitor mode is not as easy as I thought it would be.\n Am I wrong about the equivalence of WPA2-AES and WPA2-Personal\n Does anybody see anything I’m doing wrong that I’ve missed?

A whole bunch of them have Nintendo Switches and I also have one at hand, however they will not connect to the internet through our \"WPA Personal\" Ubiquiti SSID. (Nintendo Switches are simply incompatible with \"WPA Enterprise\" which we use for our main Wi-Fi network) They connect to the network with the password but throw back the message \"Registration is required to use this network\" when trying to connect to the internet. I HAVE done research but I can't find any actual solutions. Other Universities appear to collect MAC Addresses from the students and just add them manually which is no problem but I haven't the slightest idea where to do this after gathering the device's MAC Addresses.\n I think either our WatchGuard firewall or RADIUS is causing the problem but maybe I've missed a setting in the SSID setup I really don't know. I have full access to every server, everything. I just haven't a clue what to do with the Nintendo Switch's MAC Address to get it to connect to the internet :(\n Currently, I have a test \"Nintendo\" SSID on the nearest access point to me which I plan to use to troubleshoot the issue further. If I can get it to work here though I'll push it out to the other 80 access points.\n Willing to follow any guidance and answer any questions. I hope someone has come across this before.

          "description": "Hello all,\n I would like your opinion about two design that me and a colleague made for a customer. I did design 1 and he did design 2.\n Proposed design-1\n Proposed design 2: https://imgur.com/Eu1tsbn\n The customer have: two fortigate firewalls, two switches and three physical servers for their new network setup.\n Basically, the only difference is the internet connection between my design and my colleague design. He preferred that the internet terminated on the switches instead of the firewall compared to my design (internet terminated directly on the firewall). Unfortunately, he could not explain why (yeah I know.. he said that he have seen lot of customer going for design 2) and I've been trying to research about this but no luck.\n I would like if someone here know why the design 2 is preferred more than design 1. I know that it all depends on the requirements etc.. but just in general, if you would look at both designs, which one would you go for and why? I'm curious and would like to know both the pros and the cons for both design.\n ​\n Appreciate all your answers.\n ​\n EDIT: For whatever reason, I have issues naming the links from imgur so I will just post the URL for design 2. Apologize for that\n EDIT 2: there is only one ISP link and will just be a default route to the ISP (no BGP). The firewall are in HA mode, active/passive.\n    submitted by    /u/donutspro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a fairly unique and complex question, to me anyway.\n Essentially Site A (main site) has a decent number of workstations on the company domain. The interesting thing is that the networking (and firewall) is provided by a different company with the core being in an entirely different locale. The good news is that in our building, we have a switch in the basement with a few ports that assign WAN IPs. \n Using this, I set up a pfSense firewall and hooked up to WAN and LAN. At Site B we have a UniFi USG4. I set up an IPSec tunnel between the two, and got as far as being able to resolve the Windows domain from Site B, and ping the (real) LAN gateway but not any further. NO domain controller traffic was able to pass. \n Basically my thoughts were that since I have access to both a WAN IP, and the local subnet that 99% of our Windows machines are on, I had everything I needed to create a tunnel from inside of the other company's network and get our Site B network connected to resources that Site A uses WITHOUT asking the other company to make any changes. (No I'm not doing anything illegal, nor will this cause issues)\n Am I missing something? Or is it just simply not possible.\n    submitted by    /u/Lorenicci  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m a vaguely technical project manager (so apologies if some of the terminology is wrong) and I’m curious about what a future enterprise network might look like. Today we have a fairly traditional on-prem design. 2 data centres, some public facing services, VMware, F5 load balancers, mostly Cisco everything else including core switches.\n At each site we have MPLS, and local internet breakout from the same provider as the MPLS. We have Cisco L3 edge switches, and Cisco wireless access points managed via controllers at the DCs. All internet traffic goes out via the local break out, not over the MPLS.\n Most of our end user and public facing services are already in the cloud, with the rest moving over the next 3 years. And the data centres will reduce to a couple of racks of legacy internal and public facing systems.\n Endpoint security will be on the devices (zScaler), and the view is that the office network will end up no more trusted than any other network.\n At that point in 3 years time, my questions are why do we need a WAN, why do we need core switches and routing or expensive MPLS circuits? Then why do we need L3 edge switches?\n In my simple mind we would need reliable managed internet access and WiFi with a management platform. Not even sure if we need much wired Ethernet except for printers and a few other appliances. Everyone has laptops and we don’t have desk phones. Mostly normal Microsoft Office based workloads.\n So would we effectively be no different to a rent-an-office location? What equipment and management tooling do they use? Still Cisco?\n Thanks for indulging me!\n    submitted by    /u/a4333387775  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am using Python to automate configuration commands to Adtran OLT network devices. Currently, the app mostly works in the sense of being able to issue commands to retrieve information tables for parsing.\n The problem I'm up against is when I start sending commands back to apply configuration changes, something very weird happens with the CLI which I can replicate exactly through my Gnome Terminal by pasting the same commands that break in the automated interactive shell.\n Here is an example of the command set where the problem starts:\n enable config t shaper “interface gpon 1/0/1@1/4/1.gpon channel 1” 1@1/4/1.gpon rate 500000 exit shaper “remote-device 1@1/4/1.gpon_0” 1/4 rate 500000 exit exit \n For reasons unknown to me, once the space after the second double quote is sent, the shell does something weird and the command breaks as invalid.\n Here is a visual example of what happens to the CLI in Gnome Terminal which is essentially the same result I see with the automated shell as well: https://imgur.com/a/Id8snAA\n The automated shell is currently using a vt100 terminal type if that helps any. For the record, the command examples provide have been tested directly through a shell on a macOS computer and they work as intended there so the command format is where it should be.\n Any takers on what I'm missing here?\n    submitted by    /u/TesNikola  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a dozen buildings connected via a fiber loop. Each building has a Cisco switch (either 3850 or 9500), and is connected to the buildings on either side of it via layer 3 links (EIGRP).\n I also have 3 of the buildings that need to be tied together with a layer 2 link, carrying multiple vlans.\n Currently I have the layer 2 fiber strands connected to a separate set of switches, so the multiple vlans can be trunked between those buildings.\n We had a consultant come in to examine our network, and he says we don't need the extra switches - the Cisco switches have more than enough bandwidth to handle the layer 2 traffic as well as the layer 3 traffic.\n I agree with him about the capacity, but I don't know that I can have a layer 3 trunk AND a layer 2 trunk between the same switches. If I was only using a single vlan on layer 2, I'd just connect access ports on each switch to carry the same vlan between the switches. But since they need to be trunks carrying multiple vlans, I didn't think I could do that.\n Am I wrong? Is there a way I can do both on the same switches?\n    submitted by    /u/Substance_Ill  \n [link]   [comments]",
