They have passed along a job opportunity to be the IT Manager at a Non Profit for me to look at. I would be the sole IT person onsite and the description lists everything from on boarding new employees for training to writing and implementing policy. Apparently there is a significant level of vendors leveraged right now, but it still seems as though the job might be punching a bit above it's weight class in terms of expectations and salary. The network size is approximately 100 end user devices according to the recruiter (computers). \n What are people's experiences working in an environment like this? Is there a chance it could be good? Or will it be an extremely overworked shit show? \n I will also add I have previously been a network admin and systems engineer and feel as though my only weak point skillset wise will be the HIPPA stuff. I do have experience working in a heavily controlled and audited environment so I think it will be more so based around learning the new intricacies VS entirely new concepts. In the listing they specifically call out that they will send people to training to ensure their skillset stays sharp. \n The salary is more than livable (85k) as it will be a great resume builder and it's similiar to my current role as an engineer.

Any advice on the best way to transport it? \n The server rack cart will fit in my SUV if it's on its side, but that's only reasonable if it's empty. The server equipment (including a nice rack-mount UPS) is quite heavy and will fill the cart, I don't imagine that could reasonably be lifted even with 4 people (and probably not ideal to have that stuff laying on its side?).\n I have a trailer with a ramp I could borrow, but the trailer has like a whopping 2 leaf-springs of suspension so anything in there would be bounced and rattled like crazy for my 1-hour drive home over shitty roads.\n I can borrow a pickup truck, but how to get the loaded cart up into the truck?

Even given the possible security risks it entails.\n What are your thoughts on the subject, in terms of making it a law instead of a moneysink? Would it be possible?

          "description": "Like the title says I have a set of workstations at work with an unusual setup. These workstations are a 911 dispatch center and each station consists of 3 separate PCs, 5 monitors (2 PCs with 2 each nad the 3rd with just 1 monitor), all connected together with a type of KVM switch that allows users to control each machine with just one keyboard and mouse and have the desktops act as if they are all on one machine.\n The KVM device is called an Adder CCS controller and the way it functions is each machine is connected to this controller via USB and the kb/mouse connect to it. The controller allows you to move the mouse from one screen to another but in doing so switches the input of both kb & mouse to the corresponding PC. The reason why we have this odd setup instead of just consolidating the functions to one PC is that we do not own two of the PCs as they are provided by external entities to be used with their specific software product.\n This all works perfectly fine on 3 of the 4 stations but the 4th has had literally everything replaced and it continued to cause the mouse to randomly jump around, the browser windows to refresh or close and lose any info that had bene typed in, and other odd ball issues. Currently we have it setup where the one PC that had the odd issues completely separated from the controller and other systems but this is not ideal as it requires the use of two sets of kb/mouse.\n Has anyone used a setup like this before and if so do you have a recommendation for a replacement product? A traditional KVM or USB splitter is not an option as they cannot rely on needing to use a button to switch inputs, nor is a USB hub as they need the kb/mouse to only function on one screen at a time.\n So far the only thing I have been able to find is software products but we would prefer not to use that and stick with a hardware physical connection.\n    submitted by    /u/fuzzusmaximus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been thrown into this by my ankles and I'm having to learn a lot really fast so I'm making mistakes left and right.\n I'm trying to get an SNMP walk of a Juniper firewall. I know that in order for your SNMP walks to \"resolve\" the OIDs (ie, say \"SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0\" instead of \"iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0\"), you need to give SNMPWALK.exe a set of MIBs. So, fine, I got a bunch and then supplemented that with the Juniper MIBs I could find from LibreNMS's GitHub.\n After doing that the 1.3.6.1.2.1 OIDs resolve, but the enterprise OIDs (1.3.6.1.4.1) still don't -- I see this:\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.8.5.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.12.2.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n The SNMPWALK command I'm using is:\n snmpwalk -M \"C:\\MIBs\" -v2c -c myjunipercommunitystring the.firewall.ip.address \"1\"\n Any insight on this would be hugely appreciated.

          "description": "Here is a fun situation, we lease a facility with multiple companies and a shared utility area that contains the network ingress. When we moved in we installed a small wall mount enclosure with a lock for our equipment in that room. It is well marked that it is our property.\n About two year ago we found somebody popped the lock and installed their own equipment in our cabinet. We rose hell with the landlord and got it removed.\n Fast forward a couple month the same thing happened and we suspected it was the carrier tech but couldn't prove it. Since we are closest to the room our business lead on-site is often asked to allow service people in the room and we inform him under no condition should any carriers ever be given non-escorted access.\n A few weeks later we get a call that a carrier tech showed up unannounced on a Friday afternoon. He was informed we would be happy to schedule to have him return on Monday to be a good neighbor but if they couldn't escort him we didn't have time. They tech was pissed.\n When he returned the next week he still wasn't happy. Now we are in a small market so there are not a lot of local techs so we will run into him over and over....he doesn't provide service with a smile.\n Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and we have power outage and telecom issues. We arrive at the facility and find someone popped our lock again and unplugged the fiber from just our equipment (none of our neighbors).\n Before this incident the landlord refused to allow us to put our own surveillance on this common space. After explaining to him we would hold his company liable for any business losses due to their negligence to secure our equipment in a shared space we finally have a camera installed. I'm low key hoping the person who has been doing this is the person we think--we will have video evidence this time to take action.\n I hate having shared equipment closets of any type.\n    submitted by    /u/grepzilla  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each phone draws about 3W, though each advertises to the switch that it needs up to 7W.\n However, powering more than 5 phones simultaneously results in a complete POE failure. The instant a sixth device is plugged in, all POE goes completely offline. None of the phones advertise that they're pulling more than 3.7W at the time of failure. Looking at the power status page for the Meraki switch shows that it's using 13.9 W of 1612 W (???) available prior to its failure.\n I've contacted Meraki support, and they thought it was \"weird\" that the switch shows 1612 W available, but they haven't provided any tips or thoughts on why that is. Thinking the switch was defective, I replaced it with another Meraki 120-48FP, but the exact same problem occurs. I've experimented with different ports (including powering up the devices in different order), but the same problem occurs. \n The TL;DR version: Any five POE phones can be active, but the instant I power up a sixth POE phone, all POE goes offline.\n Has anyone seen this or something similar to it? I'm at my wit's end here and would greatly appreciate any troubleshooting tips.\n    submitted by    /u/usernamealreadytaknn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Reflecting on my career one truth has always emerged: \"The harder I worked, the more they took me for granted.\"\n It seems counter-intuitive, frustrating and demoralizing, so why is it?\n Well, simply put: They get used to it. When you consistently deliver high-quality work or go above and beyond what's expected, it can become the new norm. People may come to expect this level of effort from you without recognizing or acknowledging it.\n Another reason is that people may not realize how much effort you're putting in. If you're not vocal about your accomplishments or don't receive regular feedback or recognition, others may not be aware of the extent of your hard work.\n And lastly, you're running around all stressed out and scaring the commoners. Relax, everyone likes Tony, the IT guy who moves like a sloth, and doesn't react to anything, we love Tony! But then there's Marc, running around, always walking fast in the hallways, slow down Marc! His clothes are a little too tight, go up a size Marc, it's okay, relax.\n So what can you do about it? The answer is obvious, don't give so much, pull back a little. Now mind you, and put down the pitchforks, I'm speaking to my IT heroes out there, the ones who go above and beyond, answer the phone during Thanksgiving dinner, or Saturday morning at 2am.\n IT admins work in the background, they get no recognition or praise, we work in the shadows, in the server rooms and IDFs where no one can see.\n When things are working, great! \"So, what exactly do you do here again?\" And when things aren't working: \"Hey, are you working on this or what is it you do here exactly?\"\n So relax, and don't be a hero, they don't give a damn either way.\n    submitted by    /u/paperlevel  \n [link]   [comments]",

That said, I am running into issues with a boss ask: Separate Domain Admin level ability (eg: GPO changes, ADUC, etc) from our existing Admin accounts. \n Quick background of our environment:\n  \nLarge enterprise with thousands of accounts and servers globally.\n Currently, privileges are tiered out like: \n Admin Level Accounts, Admin rights on \"high security\" systems (eg:domain controllers, SCCM, core infrastructure, Active Directory / group policy management)\n Server Level Accounts. Admin rights on Utility or Application host boxes. \n Branch Level Accounts. Unprivileged workstation accounts. \n Tiered accounts only have logon rights to their respective Tiered Servers.\n \n Domain Level Servers require MFA for Local/RDP access. Our MFA solution uses federation out to Azure to authenticate. \n  \nNow the ask: What would the best way to split DA functions to its own dedicated account, but will not have admin rights over anything but AD itself. \n My idea was to Remove DA from the existing Admin Level accounts and create a dedicated \"DA-Only\" account that would not have login rights to any server (or only to a utility box), use the existing admin accounts to log into a jumpbox, and utilizing runas to open any tools needed to perform AD administration. That said, I am running into the problem where I cannot restrict the \"DA-Only\" accounts from local and TS login as that prevents that account from any sort of interactive login. \n I would love to know if anyone else has done something like this or could point me in the right direction on how to implement.

          "description": "Earlier this year, MS put out a notice that they plan to deprecate boot.wim support in WDS. In a configuration-as-code model (which will soon be mandated if you are working in the US financial sector), many organizations are necessarily moving to Intune or other \"DevOps\" tools to do post-OS configuration and state management. What these tools lack is bare metal provisioning and native WDS fills this gap perfectly.\n And while I've always been a huge fan of SCCM/MECM, it's doesn't make sense to support that scale of infrastructure just for OSD. Likewise MDT also has a great many extraneous features and is, frankly, not suitable for the enterprise.\n I am aware that you can create a custom PE image that will boot to WDS but recent PE Setup OCs seem to lack some of the command line parameters that were present in earlier versions, and I feat that w/o official boot.wim support, custom PE support cannot be relied upon in a mission critical environment.\n And while third party and even some open source solutions exist (in fact I wrote my own a few years ago), using an MS provisioning tool to deploy MS operating systems is optimal in terms of streamlined support and vendor management.\n I created user feedback item here, Please upvote if you'd like see continued support for WDS.\n    submitted by    /u/1sttec  \n [link]   [comments]",

As I'm checking the backup admin console and remote services the phone rings with an unknown number. Answer the phone and it's their office manager. First thing I say is \"What the heck is going on over there?\" I didn't even complete the sentence when their server pops back up online and the backup console says their online.

Veeam has taken over as our main backup for onsite and scaling out,however i'd like to use it for tape backups as an additional air-gapped last resort backup.\n ​\n Backup exec works fine with the tape loader however Veeam doesn't seem to acknowledge the tapes. I've reinstalled the drivers from Quantum and added the server in Veeam as a tape library. Any advise on what to try next? Does having backup exec on the server cause issues with other applications accessing the tape drive even once closed and services have been stopped? The fact it works fine on in Backup Exec suggests drivers and hardware are all fine. \n ​\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Imagination6942  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone. I'm posting here in hope some people better educated and more knowledgeable than I am might be able to help with a bit of a technical headache I have!\n I play Rocket League professionally and I'm based in the UK. Rocket League is extremely sensitive to jitter for whatever reason and I'm having a real issue with it at the moment. Unfortunately, playing at a high level requires very low jitter.\n I currently use Zen Internet (FTTP) and have a high-end router and have noticed my routing to the Rocket League servers is pretty bad. Here's a link to a WinMTR showing the issue: Routing\n The first few hops always have pretty bad jitter along them and it's incredibly annoying, resulting in a lot of in-game issues. It gets worse at peak times. \n I have contacted Zen about this issue but they won't — or can't — do anything. I use WTFast to circumvent further bad exchanges and that helps a lot, but there's still significant jitter and I feel this is because the first few hops are still used when routing. If I'm wrong about that, please let me know.\n Ultimately, I'm looking to change ISPs because of this. It's losing me money and time and is negatively affecting my mental health. To my understanding, I can't really know whether the routing of an ISP will be good or not without purchasing it first. What are my options here?\n I'd be very grateful if anyone from the UK can run a WinMTR to the same server and list their ISP alongside. To be clear, this issue is the same with pretty much all Rocket League servers.\n Thank you for your time and effort. I'll do my best to respond to comments!\n    submitted by    /u/Asaella  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lately we've had a few HP & Dell laptops (Intune managed, AAD joined) come in with dead batteries not holding charge - after a replacement, they start getting issues relating to the CMOS checksum & TPM, which usually throws the laptops into Bitlocker recovery mode. Initially I thought the CMOS battery was also EOL but replacing that doesn't seem to help, neither does clearing the TPM either through BIOS or through Windows security settings. \n It's gotten to the point where we've recalled the laptops that have had battery replacements and issued new ones due to the amount of tickets getting raised, but the laptops are still serviceable so I would like to come up with a solution to get them back into circulation. I used to work for an MSP and their hardware department would flat out refuse to fix or change any hardware on an Intuned laptop, including the battery. \n Any advice please?\n    submitted by    /u/E30_318is  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently whenever someone needs to hire someone, onboard someone, change an employeement agreement etc they do it via Microsoft forms that are connected to PowerAutomate to send the information to the correct place / inbox, this has been quite chaotic and we are looking into getting a proper \"HR Service management\" or ticketing system for HR and Salary instead.\n We have looked into the Freshservice HR workspace but since Freshservice is built for IT first it makes me quite sceptical, we also need to be able to easily create HR processes for recruitment orders, workpermits and employee changes and this has proven quite troublesome in the Freshservice demo I've worked with setting up. A lot of bugs and the documentation for Fresh leaves a lot to be desired.\n Therefore we are looking at other solutions but it's difficult to find out there, any tips or pointers?\n Our biggest needs are:\n  \nUsers being able to submit tickets to HR, and HR being able to easily view and process said tickets.\n Users being able to order new recruitments, HR then needs to be able to view current ongoing recruitment processes in some sort of list or \"view\" listing all ongoing recruitments.\n Users being able to send in work permits with HR being able to track current workpermits, aswell as being alerted when a work permit is about to expire.\n Integration into Salesforce and Azure is a must.\n All of the above needs to be exported once a month as a .csv to our HR master so it can stay up to date with the changes.\n Bonus if it has support for integration / APIs with Teamtailor.\n  \nThank you very much in advance Reddit, any tips are helpful and very much appreciated.

Specifically, the files when opened via SMB using file explorer are opening verly slowly.

Also they work without issue over OneDrive or when saved locally. \n Googling this issue reveals it is an issue with Excel file validation. So I turned it off. Still having the issue.

Or are we in the dreaded territory of \"VENDOR LOCK IN\" ?\n 🙀\n P.S.:\n 35 people start up. But not a tech one. So we have 1 IT - person - me. Migrating 700 = 35 people x 20-30? Social login accounts on various websites - is not something I want to tackle.\n    submitted by    /u/kinvoki  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We have 50+ HP desktops of the same model new in the box that need to be deployed in the coming weeks. Long story short - we recently had a cyber attack that resulted in us rebuilding our network/servers and we lost a couple of staff along the way who were the ones who usually handled our imaging process. On top of that our software packages have broken links and don't run correctly with the network rebuild, so we're not in good shape.\n The good thing is, most of our staff use the exact same base build on their devices, so if there is a way to clone one good image to multiple devices that are the same model, that would be ideal for this project. We have the software install packages, but manually pushing them can take 2-3 hours per computer and requires a few reboots. We have been lucky thus far to not need to replace a lot of PC's since the outage, and I was able to build several of them as spares to swap out if needed using the manual process.\n I know there are multiple tools out there that do many things, so I am mostly wondering what some recommendations are for something that will get the job done. We do have a couple KVM's so can image multiple at a time - but how do we package a clone of an image to push out, and what does that process look like - especially with joining devices to the domain.\n In my old job at an MSP, we just manually installed everything per device as we had a lot of small companies that requested maybe 2-3 computers at a time on average, so it was not a big deal. Prior to that I worked for a large hospital that had SCCM set up to deploy Windows on PXE boot, which was very nice, but I have no idea how that process was set up. Though I'd like to eventually find the time to create something like that for our environment.\n    submitted by    /u/Rocklobster92  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tbh they are too small with 30 devs (yet >50% growth per year).\n It's cool that I can help migrate & automate the whole infrastructure and implement new technologies by grinding myself into oblivion, but it seems like I don't have the time to improve the stuff that really needs it - and only build MVPs infrastructure wise, because anything better 'costs too much money - who will pay for this?'. I have no time to tinker like I had some years ago... and our sysadmins are ready waiting for months for some scripts that will make their life 100x easier - but I have no time and now I'm only suffering the perpetual grind of building new novel environments for customers - and can't even do them right because of #AGILE - the sprint is over, bye bye to the budget. Still, colleague wise and in terms of teamwork and communication you can't compare them to any other companies... Quality of life has improved substancially. Less stress - not having to support braindead people is wonderful - but I'm bored.\n I'm feeling like if I don't work on the real, large stuff... on the edge of new tech... I will just lose more time and this will become my new normal. I need to learn new tools, better ways of thinking and want to work on larger projects.\n Anyone here who was in a similar situation?

          "description": "When I have multiple computers I can create clusters (maybe with a technology like k8s), and with a bit of work, I can be sure to have near 100% service uptime. Meaning no matter what, even if something happens, another computer is going to handle the requests and everything will be 100% transparent to the end user. That's because the service was designed to handle such cases, maybe by running inside docker, allowing state recovery, and whatnot.\n But here I am wondering about cloud services (AWS and Azure for example). If my knowledge is up to date, these guys have big machines (like terabytes of RAM and tens of cores on a single motherboard), and they use a hypervisor to split these into smaller VM, that they can then rent.\n But in such a case, they cannot run a single VM on different computers right ? So what do they do if one of their computer suddenly has a break down ? If their architecture is designed like I described in the previous paragraph, then all the VM on that machine suddenly shutdown, and their services are no longer available ? So there is now way that they can promise near 100% machine uptime ?\n And even if you keep your machine 100% healthy, with zero internet downtime, you have your own generator in case of electric failure, how to you update your hypervisor ? Wouldn't they need a reboot from time to time ? And if you need to change components, how do you move a running VM from one machine to another ?\n I am not a sys admin btw, I do datascience and AI, so way more math and way less programming, but I am deeply interested in how they solved the problem, so don't hesitate to start from the basics, and many thanks for your time.\n    submitted by    /u/prumf  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyways they signed contract and we are going to hold them to it and let it go to collections if needed\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Mix6451  \n [link]   [comments]",

After 2 years I became the manager of that store and had 3 workers under me.\n After leaving my job as a computer store manager, I traveled Europe with my girlfriend in a motorhome. Now that I have some free time, I'm planning to study for the CCNA certification and pursue a career as a sys admin.\n I studied networking in high school through a Cisco program, and while I had the knowledge for CCNA, I never got the certificate. After highschool I was in the army ( I was a tank driver) so I forgot most of my ccna knowledge a I had.\n I also have experience with light server administration through my home server running OMV and several Raspberry Pis.\n I'm interested in hearing your advice on what areas I should focus on as I work toward becoming a sys admin. I believe I'll have to start in a help desk role and work my way up, but I'm not sure what specific skills and knowledge I should prioritize. Are there other certifications or training programs that you would recommend? How much will a degree help and if it will, in what subject? \n Before the computer store I did 3 months in tech support in an isp, but hated every second.\n I'm eager to learn and grow in this field, and I would appreciate any advice you can offer based on your experiences.

Light, good keyboard and trackpad, 3:2 display (glossy but the new ones can be ordered mat), open with one finger, P series processors, and the interchangeable USBC ports is pretty slick. Top it off everything can be changed or upgraded easily.\n Downsides are there is just one size, but a 16\" coming later this year, no TB ports, battery life is meh at 5-6 hours, and fans can spin up when under load.\n Curious if anyone has used these at scale or any feedback on them?

I'm more curious for those who would consider it (like me), and what factors you'd weigh into the value of that work. I'm obviously considering equal factors with work environment, on-call, benefits packages, etc.\n I think my absolute minimum looks something like this:\n ((Time To Get Ready in AM) + (Commute Time Round Trip)) * Approximate OT Hourly Rate * 250 work days PLUS vehicle costs for that year.\n So for example, a $72k remote job, to move in person with a 30 minute commute each way would really need:\n ((1 hour + 1 hour) * 54 * 250) + (($400 car payment + $100 insurance + $100 gas)*12)\n $34.2k more, or $106,200 total.

We have corporate Gmail and originally their email/calendar/contacts were set up in iOS Mail using Activesync. Everyone assumed that this information was a 2-way sync, i.e. for example a contact entered manually on the phone would automatically sync up to the cloud, and any change they made in the cloud contacts would sync down to the phone. Seems like this was not the case though and manually-entered contacts were only getting stored locally on the phone, yet they were still attached to the contact list associated to the Activesync account.\n Recently the Messaging Team decided to phase this out and have everyone use the Gmail app instead. Problem is someone accidentally cut off the Activesync access before End User Support had a chance to migrate their data. Users started getting a persistent prompt to update their password, but this didn't work because the account was gone from the system essentially. People got fed up and just deleted the account, this process does not offer any option to keep stored contacts, you have the ability to either Erase or Cancel.\n Now in the texts and other apps there are phone numbers with no name attached.

All the information I’ve received so far is hearsay, but it seems that upper management is considering outsourcing security to a third party company and firing the internal security team. It’s been almost two weeks since the incident stopped, but we are all somehow still employed.\n The team was advised by the C-Suite that we are primary witnesses to the incident and that we may be involved in the litigation process from customers. It seems that I may be questioned by lawyers in the future based on my testimony. We have been asked to prepare a statement and timeline of the work we have completed near the incident.\n I’ve completely given up on having any future with this company and I am doing just what I need to do to stay on payroll as long as possible while I look for another job. I do not trust anything my employer says/does.\n Has anyone ever had to testify on behalf of their company? Do I really have to? \n Would the statement I create affect my future unemployment claim?

If you are one of those \"QB doesn't work on a VM\" people, please do not respond to this thread. It normally works fine, I have many customers on this scenario, including other DC/RDS combo VMs and the only issue is the conflict with the DNS server service. \n Anyone familiar with this topic knows there are two fixes to the service conflict:\n 1 - netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange commands\n 2 - script having the QuickBooksDB## service start BEFORE the DNS Server service\n ​\n OK, so hopefully we're on the same page here. Now to the NEW issue.\n For this customer, an earlier version of QuickBooks was working fine with the script-service-start-order workaround, for years. Then we upgrade to QuickBooks 2023. I know the number in the service name changed, I accounted for that. \n The new issue with QB2023 is not that the QuickBooksDB33 service doesn't start - it does. The issue is severe slowness in the QuickBooks program when the DNS Server service is running. Stop that service, QuickBooks runs well again. I have tried the excludedportrange commands (yes for the dynamic port listed in Database Service Manager) and port 8019, both TCP and UDP. I have tried the \"starting services in the proper order\" workaround, this does not work either. \n I've researched and beat up on this issue for hours. Asking other Redditors is my last attempt before telling the customer they need two hosted servers so I can move the AD roles and DNS off of the RDS.

Is it good enough to give static IPs to some devices on my DHCP server and leave the rest dynamically allocated or is it recommended to also use subnets e.g. with subnet mask 255.255.254.0 to then potentially have 4 subnets\n 192.168.0.0/26 192.168.0.128/26 192.168.1.0/26 192.168.1.128/26\n so I can give devices in different subnets? What would be the advantages of that? Is this more secure and faster? Or am I thinking wrong and I do need VLANs to have those advantages?

In these instances, the GPO would likely hit machines that have already been onboarded via one of the methods above.

          "description": "Hi all,\n Recently in our Win11 estate (latest versions via GPO) has started to 'lose' user files and folders in the OS. These have been discovered in TreeSize (run as local admin) in hidden folders named 'found.000', 'found.001' etc. These directories are not visible to the OS even with hidden folders enabled. In some instances, it's possible to cut/paste files back to the original locations (with associated integrity checks) but in other cases there are several TBs of files and folders lost and in most cases renamed with an appended number.\n I understand that these are chkdisk fragmented files or they have been moved by chkdisk. Is there a method or utility to restore these files and directories and 'fix' the issues that chkdisk identified without a manual trawl through?\n The scale is such that I would consider a commercial software solution.\n Many thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/tastefulcardigan  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll try and describe it as best as I can not to waste your time.\n ​\n We have been experiencing issues with websites timing out for a while now. It is sporadic and doesn't happen on any particular websites. It can be one website sometimes, then it works fine 5 minutes after, and then five minutes after the website working before, times out now. One thing that seems consistent is when a website times out, it seems to be able to load afterwards.\n ​\n There is no real other network impact, internal seems to be fine, servers seem to be running fine internally. \n Pinging is no issue, NSlookup is no issue.\n I've noticed that when trying to load a website, it may be very slow but connecting anyway. In Devtools it will have a stalled time on 15+ seconds and the rest seems perfectly fine.\n We have a setup of 4 MS250, 2 MS425, 2 MX84. Everything is completely firmware updated and have tried restarts just to make sure. \n We've had 2 different network consultants come and have a look at it, with no luck. I've written to our ISP but the issue seems to be non existent when connecting directly to our Edge router, so they're positive the issue is at our end, and the consultants are positive the issue is at the ISP end. \n We are at a loss, and this is why I turn to reddit in my final hour of sanity. To hopefully find the hero who has the answer to my prayers.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Savings_Produce2326  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been tasked with data migration in SharePoint online sites, initially the \"guru\" admin said automation is not possible and we've all concluded that I can do this in 3-4 months, and during a couple of weeks, I was able to create a small script that can almost automate the entire process. With this script, I could move thousands of sites in just a few days, possibly even over a weekend.\n Here's my problem: I'm not sure if I should tell my boss about this script or not. On one hand, it could save the company a lot of time and resources, and I believe it's something they should know.

Boss wants to set our TTL to 6 seconds with the argument people using the site wouldn't notice the 5 second outage before the LB updates and we can be more nimble with DNS changes.\n Next up is a project manager that wants the TTL set to 12 hours so we can fix any DNS issues before anybody notices.\n I have spent 3 hours in a meeting with both of them trying explain why we want longer ttl than 6 seconds, but less than 12 hours. Once I address the ttl that's too short, the other says \"great, set it at 12 hours\". Then while I'm explaining why we want it less than 12 hours, the other says \"great, 6 seconds\",\n It's currently at 10 min because the PM's project makes alot of changes to their site and want the changes to take immediate effect for all of the public, but doesn't understand that the 12 hour TTL is completely opposite of that.\n The EE doesn't understand the additional latency of clients having fresh dns queries every 6 seconds. \n They are wearing me down and one of the stupid ideas is going to win.\n    submitted by    /u/jack-dempsy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The target servers return the WMI Access Denied error.\n In another environment Batchpatch is able to Check for updates, see CPU usage etc.\n Using winver to check the build number, the build number is identical on the BatchPatch servers and the target servers in both environments. Windows Firewall configuration is identical, the servers are even part of the same domain, have the same GPOs applied etc.\n We have three questions and would appreciate any feedback on either one:\n  \nIs there something we can do to make BatchPatch continue to work? We thought it was the vendor's responsibility to make sure that their tools continue to work post DCOM hardening. And it does work, in one of the subnets as per BatchPatch documentation.\n If there is something we can do, should we avoid that due to security concerns? \n Are there any other tools for Patch Management you recommend that work 100% post DCOM hardening? Preferably in-house/on-prem tools due to legal constraints. Must be able to schedule when the Servers reboot, automatic reboots are out of the question.

          "description": "Gotta start off with that I'm kinda ashamed to post this but google isn't helping me out at all. So what's the problem:\n In W11 if I open certain application, i can't use other applications/functions like using my browser. I can scroll in my browser but I can't type, open a new tab or even click on a page. The focus is fully on that application. If i minize the application, i can once again use my browser (or file explorer etc.). This is on my home pc. I learned to live with it since there is a workaround. Since I couldn't find a fix i thought maybe it was a \"feature\" of W11 and stopped researching it. \n Now i don't know when it happened but I'm now having the same issue on my work laptop which runs on W10. Once I open up PowerShell ISE, the focus gets locked on it and i can't perform any other actions, wether that is opening file explorer or just browsing the internet. I can scroll through whatever is open but that's it. \n It isn't focus mode (which seems to do something entirely else) and this is really disturbing my ability to perform my work. If i Google Windows locks browser, i get shit about locked screen sigh...\n What in god's name is going on here? Why are certain applications getting \"on top\", stealing focus and Ms/kb input? Any suggestions are welcome!\n Edit: Ctrl+spacebar doesn't fix it btw.\n    submitted by    /u/Redac07  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m asking because I’ve noticed a recurring issue with all US-based ISPs periodically losing all DNS information for an entire TLD, and all domains on that TLD (including mine) appear to vanish and go offline. \n Ping, nsloookup, and dig can’t resolve the domain to an IP. The entire TLD is gone, while all other domains remain online. \n Multiple third-party products, tools, and services confirm that the entire TLD ceases to exist for several hours at a time, which is very puzzling. Many alerts and notifications from our vendors arrive when this happens. \n I’ve reached out to ICANN for some information, but they are apparently not an authority for this TLD (it’s one of the newer ones that’s country-specific). \n The registry for the domain says there’s no issue, but they aren’t testing through any US-based ISPs. My offshore team can still access our infrastructure, while myself and all our US-based customers cannot. \n The registry’s website is also offline to all US-based traffic when this happens, since it uses the same TLD (*.et). Sites like downforeveryoneorjustme.com show their site as down when this happens. \n Very strange. Not sure where to look for answers. Thanks!\n Update: I’m realizing that troubleshooting this issue will require more experienced folks in networking. Terms like Bogon Routes, Looking Glass, ASN, IANA, and others mentioned here are new to me. If you’re particularly experienced in this space and are available for some consulting, or on-call emergency troubleshooting next time it happens, please send me a DM. I’d like to assemble a small group that can help get to the bottom of this US-only ISP / TLD issue.

We have 65 VMs (VMware environment) spread across multiple locations, Cisco switches, Fortigate firewalls and APs, UPSs, EMC SANs, Dell servers, Veeam Backup, Wasabi, SharePoint, OneDrive, O365 Mail (hybrid), Power BI, and 100 iPads (with a subpar MDM). The list could go on and on, and my point here is that we have only one IT director, one system administrator/network administrator/security person (me), and three helpdesk folks. One of the helpdesk people is amazing, but the other two just float by.\n My question is this: I've been here for 8 years, and I've noticed that we get zero training, everything is a dumpster fire that needs to be put out, management doesn't listen to important security changes that need to be made, and there are no policies in place, such as an email policy, internet policy, BYOD policy, etc. (I have sent all of these to management and HR for approval, but they just don't write back.) The culture here, as in the people, is great; I've never worked with such an array of awesome people. However, they don't seem to care about any structure or advancement of learning of any kind.

If I can get examples of current names and why they are named that way I would greatly appreciate it.\n Edit 1: to provide an example of what we are doing, the printer refresh walkthrough revealed 324 printers, we have managed to reduce that down to 300. There are departments that have a single location like one suite and is somewhat simple, there are others that have multiple locations throughout the city. We currently have the implementation of the Follow-me printer and have many staff that use it as was suggested in the comments. One example I can provide is the Police Department and the many building they occupy and the multiple units within their headquarters, for instance I’ll make a couple up just for example: PD-224MFP01 or FIN-MFP02, for the first example Police Department/building/Multi-Function Printer/1st out of 2 printers.

I can't say if MRP speeds are faster as we have only had the MRP system recently so it was just being implemented when the lines switched, , but the CAD stuff would work almost as quickly as if onsite\n ​\n Now, what takes milliseconds onsite is taking 20 or so seconds (this is just opening windows, no manipulation of the MRP/CAD files). Speaking to our MSP, they have said that it's due to the XG overhead on processing and routing the data. But I genuinely struggle to see it slowing speed down so much. Especially as the CAD stuff worked file over L2TP \n If correctly configured, should we be seeing such delays over VPN? Onsite, everything is fine. The MRP and CAD software are hosted on SQL instances inside the network.

They recently moved to another office and finally made the choice to put some money into new server hardware, so we migrated their Srv2016 DC from an old ESXi to a new one. We didn't do a V2V (for various reasons) but chose to simply make a final Veeam backup and restored it as a new VM on the new host.\n At first boot the machine went into safemode (with AD repair) as we've expected. So we logged on, changed boot behaviour back to normal and rebooted several times to check if it's running correctly.\n Now, ~2 weeks later, users complained they didn't have access to a share anymore.\n So we've tried to login on the DC using our Domain Admin user and realised it isn't working. Screen says \"user can't login due to account restrictions or maybe wrong characters in password - as a blank\". That's nonsense. So we tried to login using the local admin account and there it says the account would have been deactivated (which isn't true either).\n Now we're stuck except for having remote powershell access (as system user) with our RMM software.\n I already used it for checking if some safemode has been activated (bcdedit) - which isn't the case.\n We also restarted the machine twice yesterday evening. Startup takes ages, but eventually it comes up to the same state.\n Anyone any idea?\n Cheers\n Jay\n    submitted by    /u/jay-from-the-bay  \n [link]   [comments]",

We recently acquired a new customer, and unfortunately, their IT personnel have left the company, leaving us with the responsibility of managing their IT infrastructure. Previously, the IT personnel was the main point of contact for everything related to their IT infrastructure.\n Currently, we are facing an issue where the owner of the company has access to only one of the domains' admin credentials, which he can use to manage the account or manage some of the systems. However, there are two different domains, and we cannot access the second domain controller. Additionally, the infrastructure includes a mixture of Linux and Windows machines with various operating systems, but we only have access to about 10% of that infrastructure due to a lack of credentials.\n For Linux machines, I am planning on resetting the root credentials individually.\n Is there any way for us to gain access to the second domain controller? We have access to their VM host, but we are unable to log in to that particular OS. \n Thank you in advance for your help.\n    submitted by    /u/Too_buggy_01110100  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or do I just need to write another one that looks at the Content-Disposition header separately, not depending on Microsoft's interpretation of it?\n    submitted by    /u/JohnEDee  \n [link]   [comments]",

But documentation indicates that shared mailboxes are limited to 50gb. Historically, when we would offboard a user who's mailbox is bigger than 50GB, we would add in an Exchange E2 license to allow access to the mailbox.\n If we DID have an archive policy in place, presumably after we converted the users mailbox to a shared - the archived mailbox would disappear at some point?\n These discussions happening as we determine the best path our our existing LARGE mailboxes (who are licensed with E3) - that we want to get licensed for Business Premium.

One of my main responsibilities is being a server admin for a k12 district. We have survived ransomware several years ago and my responsibilities have only grown since then. I know for my own mental health I have to disconnect and leave work at work but it can be difficult sometimes with a looming fear that some hacker out there wants nothing more than to destroy everything that we’ve built. I was just wondering how some of you deal with this type of thing as I know it is common in our field. Be safe out there and take needed time for yourself and your family life. Burnout is real.\n Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice and kind words. It’s tough out there and things can be stressful at times so prepare the best you can to deal with situations when they happen. The best option being to have shared knowledge and responsibilities. Backup what’s important and document everything that would help in the event of a disaster. Don’t shoulder the burden alone. A job is not worth your mental health. Stay safe out there and take care of yourselves.\n    submitted by    /u/thegreatgetzby  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got my computer in there and also a user. I've tested SRP under User and also Computer and can confirm the GPO is reaching the machine.\n However, weirdly it seems as if none of the path rules are doing anything? I've explicitly blocked several paths and extensions (EXE's, MSI's, BAT's, etc) and as the user, I can run BAT's and EXE's with no worries whatsoever. The student account I am testing with is not a local administrator either. \n I've been troubleshooting this all week and am completely lost now. There are no SRP logs in Event Viewer either, so I can't even see why it isn't working. \n Any advice for me here is greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n EDIT - Might have my answer already.

          "description": "Story from the last layoff...\n We now have this policy in place that, when you're let go, you start a \"countdown\" till your last day. Some layoffs have been 30 days, some have been 60 days, some have been two weeks. But while you're \"counting down,\" you can take all the paid time off you want to look for a job. Some managers let you go home with your laptop and just WFH till your last day.\n Now, as generous as this sounds, they do this for a singular reason. If you find another job during your countdown, you're not eligible for the severance package.\n Well, we had one guy that had been there FOREVER and got laid off. He was eligible for well over 6 months' salary in severance. Out of respect for his long history with the company, his manager let him WFH during his whole 30 day countdown...\n 28 days into his countdown, someone from my company goes to another company to have lunch with a friend. And he sees his old coworker working there at a desk, with our company laptop with the asset tag clearly visible on the open lid. When the guy walks away from his desk, sure enough, it's our laptop. The guy is VPNed in, and logged into Outlook and MS Lync (This should tell you how long ago this happened).\n The guy comes back from lunch and tells his coworkers about how the guy they lost on the team landed at a new company where this guy they know works. Sadly, the manager overheard them talking. He called HR. And the guy lost his severance package.\n So damn close...\n    submitted by    /u/plazman30  \n [link]   [comments]",

I essentially consult but in a way i am onsite with the company handling all their docs, internal items, and other for smaller companies which is why i can administrate so many at once. I have one company i've been with for 10+ years but they got bought out and now have an MSP, that literally just keeps making mistake after mistake. They are never onsite, they move around reservations DHCP and change scopes due to lack of knowing the firewall, and generally cause the site a lot of issues. Which is great for me right, i make a ton of money off their mistakes. Sorry but that isn't my game. I like good business and administration, not causing a hedge fire and saying o well #xyz is just another client. Recently i did a large overhaul and installation of new networks, vlans, wifi, ect... Today i get a call they made more changes and now changed the firewall password essentially forcing everything through them which for me means extra hours billing to wait on a tech. Is it time to just let the clients turn into an inferno and go about my day or should i be grateful my income is probably going to double from them and just shut up and color?\n It just really freakin urks me how bad they are for such a large company taking care of a small hotel which is literally nothing to manage.

However, we want two stations in our office to be available for remote people to use when needed. In an ideal world, those two stations could be connected to any of the Mac Studios at any time. The Macs would live in our data closet, and the stations would be about 30 feet away near a fiber-connected switch (if that makes a difference).\n My first thought was a KVM, but I’ve heard that these are not the most reliable in terms of latency.

At present, we use a Public Folder mailbox to manage project team emails, and the mailbox database has grown to 125GB in size. It would be much larger than that if we weren't using Metalogix Archive Manager to archive many of those Public Folder emails.\n The Public Folder database in Exchange Online is 100GB and Shared Mailbox is 100GB, which is insufficient for our needs. I'm exploring alternative solutions for sharing emails among project team members.

Our licenses are applied via AAD Groups where we have license features turned on/off as required. Our CSP/NCE handled the process and opted to upgrade our existing licenses. When the process completed all staff were on E5 with ALL E5 features turned on including Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing.\n Evidently, Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing once enabled does the following:\n  \nSends an email to all staff with their personal Audio Conferencing pin information (most of my staff thought this was a phishing email).\n Updates all future and recurring Teams Calendar meeting entries with the new Dial-in features. This uses the Meeting Migration Service (MMS) - Link\n Sends a meeting invite update to all attendees for each updated meeting\n If the recipient has their OoO on, an auto response is of course sent back to the organiser\n  \nThe above has caused mass confusion for our staff and in some instances, users have 60+ meeting invites and auto response/OoO messages all at exactly the same time.\n It's on us for not looking into this more but evidently its caught other people out as well.

          "description": "Hello everyone, \n I work as a tier 2 technician for an MSP and was wondering what other people's experience is with being in an on-call rotation is like, this is my first actual position working directly in IT and based on feedback I have gotten from other people I know in the field I've been told that my on-call rotation unrealistic especially for the return. \n I work in a team of 4 technicians and 3 of us participate in on-call which consists of being the only user working on after-hours tickets, 5PM-9PM Monday-Friday and 9AM-9PM weekends. We are expected to review any tickets that come in and work on them if they are deemed by either the customer or us important enough to service outside of normal hours, permitting their company has a proper contract for after hours support or they get approval from someone willing to pay the premium. This on-call included driving out to customer locations if the issue is of a truly critical nature. \n The on-call rotation is a full week from 5PM Friday until the following Friday, and then 2 weeks no on-call for the other 2 on-call technicians, thus a 3-week cycle. The compensation for this on-call is 80 hours of vacation time that is awarded immediately on your start date with no rollover. \n IF they hire additional Tier 2+ technicians then the rotation would be divided among all applicable techs but it's already been six months and it doesn't seem like they will be getting more people. \n So yeah let me know what your on-call experiences are like and what you think of mine. Thank you.\n Note: Also for added context the company I work for has terrible procedure, leadership, and communication skills, and almost no one to fall back on if you have trouble resolving an issue.\n    submitted by    /u/DJSeras  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lately we are getting more MacOS and Linux user and we thought that we should enable that feature and give the users more options, or better said easier options.\n First I found this article and did it step by step: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr-writeback\n Sadly after I activated the option in Azure AD Connect I got an error that password writeback couldn't be enabled and that I should check the eventlog. Okay then I began my search in the eventlog.\n …",

Logged off, intending to re-add the user. For no particular reason, I tried to log the user back on with his Win Hello PIN (which I knew because I had set him up and he hadn't changed it). I was surprised that the login was successful; it went right to a new-user Windows Hello setup, where I reassigned him the same PIN.\n It's concerning that the laptop cached the PIN after the user and profile were deleted.

Previously was set to every 16 hours by the previous guy. \n I have noticed the GPO was setup to auto download and schedule the install. The schedule install day is everyday and install time set to 10am. \n Is there a way to get the updates auto install at any time in the day when they are available to the endpoints instead of the set 10am schedule. If a laptop comes online after 10am the updates won’t install until the following day assuming it’s online before that time. \n Is there also a command I can run to force a machine to check for updates? I have used pswindowsupdate before using PDQ inventory to run a remote powershell command to check and install updates to the endpoints but from my understanding that doesn’t log in the update history under the updates settings tab in Windows. (I may be wrong)\n Appreciate any advice\n    submitted by    /u/Clear_Kale5947  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n What equipment or software do you all use for providing vendor access to your network? We are currently using Global Protect with a series of rules and HIP polices to check a vendor PC for security updates and AV, but I personally do not find this very easy to manage. It also brings up various other security concerns. Our vendors are mapping drives to their PCs and accessing internal web-services only.\n I am thinking of moving towards VM Jump boxes or an actual appliance for remote access. I'm curious what others have in place for a similar scenario.\n Thanks! \n EDIT:\n This was an inherited process that I am trying to move away from for various reasons as many of you all posted in the comments. We have a few enterprise applications that can only be managed by the vendor. \n We have LPA enabled with policies in the FW, but it is cumbersome and time consuming. \n We've been looking at StrongDM, BeyondTrust, and I heard SecureLink out there too. This is the way IMO. So, any input on ZTNA or IAP would be much appreciated. \n    submitted by    /u/cyberdoodles  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, we do not want the user to navigate manually to the path \\\\server00\\folder\\file1.pdf as there maybe something within \\\\server00 that we do not want the user to have access to.\n I can *probably* do individual permissions per user and it will work however...it's over ~400 users and managing that will be a nightmare...\n Ideally, I'd like to turn off UNC path access but allow it through the ERP application access. I know you can turn off UNC access via GPO and I tested this already but then it breaks the access through the ERP application when the user is logged in as well.\n Thanks for any feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/ryujin350z  \n [link]   [comments]",

In order to prevent attacks like CVE-2023-23397 we want to block all outgoing SMB connections that are not going to private cidr ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0, etc..) entirely, blocking this attack vector for future vulnerabilities like this one. Preferably we would like to use the Windows firewall for this, because we have no control over home routers and blocking these connections from home workers using company laptops. We can however control the Windows firewall rules using powershell on all of our endpoints, but I cant seem to block outbound SMB connections at all. We want to deploy firewall rules using this example powershell:\n New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Block SMB connections to public IP subnets\" -Direction Outbound -Protocol TCP -RemotePort 139,445 -RemoteAddress \"0.0.0.0-9.255.255.255\",\"11.0.0.0-172.15.255.255\",\"172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255\",\"192.169.0.0-255.255.255.255\" -Action Block \n It adds the block rule on top of the list wwith outbound rules, but somehow SMB connections keep working, even if I add our local NAS device to the RemoteAddress list.\n  \nWindows firewall is enabled\n Rule is present in all profiles\n ChatGPT had no useful tips for me 🫣\n  \nAnyone know how to do this using Windows firewall?\n    submitted by    /u/cfvr  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's your fucking operating system you halfwits and you can't even include basic drivers for your own fucking hardware. I just can't even.\n Today I've taken my first delivery of three Surface Laptop 4 devices. They've got the usual lack of chipset drivers with the new lack of any network drivers whatsoever.

I can't even \"unzip\" it as the CABs inside obfuscate the filenames so they're useless.\n FOR FUCKS SAKE MICROSOFT. SORT YOUR SHIT.

I have been playing around with Dymo Connect, Zebra Designer on Microsoft and the Avery Design & Print website. Using the database function I can create unique SKU labels with OEM automative part numbers, SKU barcodes and qr codes to URLs from an excel spreadsheet.\n I can also add numerical counters to these functions. Making them sequential off the excel cell data which represents each donor vehicles individual ID number.\n What I would love is to add a product image to the label which is also the first image on the eBay listing.\n I can't seem to embed any images into the excel cell. All 3 label making softwares are reading the image from the database as text and displaying 'picture' instead of the image.\n I can manually add images to each label but it will take way too long. I would much prefer the images automatically generate onto each new label as the barcodes and other data does.\n Can anyone help me out or point me in the right direction?\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/No-Army6095  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are a fairly small company, less than 200 people so I know everyone. On top of that, we are an even leaner IT team. Everyone but myself has a specialized role. I am a tweener that works between our SQL, Application and Infrastructure teams. I was made aware that my coworker who is the only other sysadmin in the company is being terminated over the next few days. I am sick to my stomach and the only saving grace is that my neck isn’t on the line.

Now, the Chromebooks all have the same issue. When using wireless, it does not auto connect like it is supposed to. You can manually enter the CBNet Wi-Fi and password and use the Chromebook, but once you power off an on again, it doesn't auto-connect (although you can still click on the network and connect because the SSID and password are saved.\n We called the company, and they said that it is not an issue they've had, and they bought their motherboards from different manufacturers for the 3100 and 3100 2 in 1. We have tried an OS recovery, but we can't powerwash because we had it disabled in the Admin Console (it still appears to be disabled). We also can't powerwash through the console. It shows the last activity on the Chromebooks as months ago. When connected to the network with an ethernet to USB adapter, you can login to the Chromebook and use it.\n We have tried manually connecting to other Wi-Fi's, and that works the same as with CBNet.

I have a ton of experience dealing with all sorts of hardware, software, peripherals, etc. With the contracting world there comes times when you must job hop for one reason or another. Mostly I only hop when my contract is coming to an end and the current company hasn't been able to place me on another contract. So that means that I have to interview all over again, which I don't mind. The part that I do mind is having some cocky kid ask the most asininely questions to me during an interview about my skills or background. I'm not sure whether they are meaning to be asses to show their worth to their boss and use me as their example or if they genuinely do not know how to do an interview. For example, only a few years ago I had this guy ask me what I would do if a user reported they were having an issue while printing. Seriously??? A freaking printer problem?? That's Tier 1, at best, and I'm Tier 2/3 my entire career since about 1995 and this guy asks me about a printer issue and how I would resolve it?\n So, what's the most assinine thing you've been asked during an interview as part of your experience?\n    submitted by    /u/NormanRB  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am trying to understand something. My company is trying to migrate an on-premise ERP (Sage 300) to the cloud. We were advised by Sage's business partner in my country to set up a cloud instance with 16 GB of RAM, 4CPUs and 120GB SSD storage which we did. However, we logged in four simultaneous users and it seemed to be a bit sluggish. Given that during normal business operations, we'll have more than 10 simultaneous users logged in, this didn't seem like a good fit. Now, the confusion is this, the business partner had asked for a lot of money to set the server up. They say that there is a way you set up the server so that it becomes faster, he even mentioned that he has a server with the same specs handling more than 18 simultaneous users logged and working seemlessly. The question is, what is this \"way\" they are talking about? From my understanding the steps of setting up a server are pretty standard, I mean, chose the package (In my case AWS Lightsail) and then launch it. Are there any tips and tricks I am missing? A new installation I believe doesn't come with heavy and buggy software that would slow down the server.

Since the user has never logged in, they haven't requested a certificate from the CA, so it therefor can't connect. \n The only way around this is for them to login for the first time while connected to ethernet, and do a \"gpupdate /target:user /force\" which carries out the user's CSR and certificate issue process. Not ideal. \n Anyone got an idea on how to work around this, besides stopping user-handoff all together?\n    submitted by    /u/le_gazman  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you exceed the character limit, you receive an error message when you try to do anything within the synchronized document libraries, like creating folders or renaming documents.\"\n However, in article 2 it says it can be up to 520. Is anyone able to advise on what the source of truth is please? Additional information at the bottom if you have questions.\n Article 1 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/change-address-contact-and-more?view=o365-worldwide\n Article 2 - https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/restrictions-and-limitations-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa\n Why am I doing this? – The organisation name is really long and it significantly cutting into the file character limit count\n Have you tested this? – Yes I have and I’m getting stuck at 256/260 characters. However, this could be down to the ‘long file paths’ setting, which I am struggling to get working. I don’t want to further troubleshoot the ‘long file paths’ not working correctly if it’s not going to be supported in the first place.\n Kind Regards,\n Max\n    submitted by    /u/justlittleme123  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then cancel all other subscriptions.\n A few questions, there seems to be a few different options for 365, if all the files go onto the personal account/cloud, can I from my one drive ,view everything if it is set to share with my MS account?\n Wondering whether to get the 365 family, apart from the 1TB per user, is there any advantage?\n All the apps/software which is available,is not really something I need.\n I also came across 365 Pro Plus, which I cannot figure out what it is exactly. It seems to be a one time payment, with the same as 365 personal or family is a renewable licence.\n Can anyone explain the difference?\n I hope this make sense what I ask.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Mr__T_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I get to learn new stuff every day and absolutely adore that. Now to my question. How do you deal with office politics? I interface often with our c suite due to our helpdesk being very inexperienced so I end up spending about 15 hours a week fixing printers and explaining how to use word to people who make 3x what I do. I don't mind that part so much but it's a vipers nest up there and they keep dragging me into it. My boss does what he can and tells me to point them to him but then the same people are just even more pissed at me. I'm now getting more and more angry about the situations I'm pulled in to, mostly the accusations that IT doesn't do anything while I'm working 50-60 hour weeks to keep thing halfway working while I upgrade as much as I can.

This year, was promised it again, my review was written well, even got a bonus. The raise though, is less than what inflation did to my paycheck (technically, I am making less regarding inflation).\n How much actual work within a company does it take to get promoted - from the upper-management side of things with paperwork and the final decision? I've usually trusted my manager pretty solid, and our communications has been pretty spot on for the many years I've worked with him, but starting to question things... .

          "description": "Say I have N different servers each serving it's own webapp. I want to put these servers behind a reverse proxy, but now I created a single point of failure: if my reverse proxy is going to fail I wont be able to access any of these webapps.\n ​\n Is it possible to scale my reverse proxies up to 2-3 machines? My guess would be to setup local DNS and keep DNS server monitoring for main rpxory status, then switch 'A' record to another rpoxy if it fails, but I don't know how to implement this switchover (if it's even possible) and now it seems that this local DNS is going to be SPOF, so...\n ​\n Q: Why do you want to use rproxy and/or local DNS?\n A: To ease maintenance of the system. I can quickly change which domain (or ip) points to which machine and it's port (in case of rproxy).\n ​\n (If exact products relevant to this problem, I would use nginx as rproxy and bind9 as local DNS)\n    submitted by    /u/Demiler  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the carelessness is deliberately filtering for victims already. \n I have seen some very high quality spear-phishing attempts recently, that don't have \"mistakes\" in them. They have email addresses that look very plausible - sometimes spoofed, sometimes belonging to the .co.uk for a .com or similar.\n Occasionally coming from a personal email that looks like it could be a legitimate member of staff. Etc. \n But elegantly crafted, personalised and a very plausible sort of request or warning. \n The only way to spot these is to be skeptical about all of them. Don't rely on lazy scammers to be obvious about it, because that makes you vulnerable to the ones that aren't.\n If you want an analogy, then lets go with foraging for mushrooms. There's a load of varieties of mushrooms that are edible and very tasty. Some look a bit weird. https://www.wildfooduk.com/mushroom-guide/?mushroom_type=edible\n But if I describe to you Fly Agaric and you avoid that, it still doesn't make the Destroying Angel safe to eat!\n (Seriously - don't go foraging mushrooms unless you are VERY sure you recognise exactly which varieties are 'safe', and never ever eat one you're even slightly unsure about).\n    submitted by    /u/sobrique  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's doable but not fun at all. \n Is it possible to \"trick\" the domain into avoiding the tombstone at powerup? Say for example, going into each machine at initial powerup before the OS is loaded and setting the BIOS clock back close to the last time the domain was live, and then moving the clock forward after all the machines have synced up? The machines will not have an external NTP time source initially so we don't expect that they will magically fix their clocks until we do it manually.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/wysoft  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't remember ever being told to document or even how to document. \n Even certs like A+, Net+, CCNA, or the few mcse courses I'm familiar with. None of them talk about the importance of documentation. The closest might be LAN/WAN diagrams or taking backups.\n My company even provides access to an online learning system and there are no specific courses on documentation or technical writing.\n Any time I work on or deploy a new system or software, there's usually a combination of three types of documentation I create; End User (if needed), information for the IT team to support/troubleshoot and personal notes (such as articles referenced during setup, steps to reproduce or other notes that wouldn't be beneficial to the team.)\n Even two or three sentences about something could save someone in the future time, headache and hassle.\n Most of the time, I don't create documentation for others - I create it for myself so I have something to reference in the future or can send to end users to minimize their need to reach out and bother me.\n Gah!\n    submitted by    /u/Exotic-Start-5039  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm sure many of us work with one, or have worked with one. \n The person who intentionally sets things up in such a complicated way that only they know how to administer it, maybe to feel a sense of importance or job security? \n We have an admin who refuses to use a windows computer and does everything via Mac, even though our environment is 99% windows. We have a small team of media relations people who use Mac for graphic design, video editing, and a few apps that are specific to Mac. This is around 3 people. \n This same admin, when tasked with rebuilding a Windows 2012 file server, insists on using Linux/Samba because it \"will probably play nicer with the Macs\". This is 2023, I highly doubt a Mac can't connect to a Windows SMB share. At the same time, he also insists on running BIND DNS inside a FLAR container on Solaris, when he is the only one that knows Solaris - these boxes also haven't been patched in years and run insecure versions of BIND.\n What do you call these people?

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I'm a new system administrator at a company that recently had a major server failure, and it was quite the experience. The server was hosting six production VMs, and due to a single PSU failure and motherboard issue(My finding), it completely failed. The worst part was that the previous system administrator had not backed up the critical databases.\n As the new guy, I was tasked with recovering the databases, and I was totally freaked out. I tried to recover the databases, but the server was unable to POST the ESXi, which made things even more challenging. After some trial and error, I decided to unmount the server from the rack and take it to my desk. I disassembled the server, removed the RAM, cleaned it with a vacuum, and rested it for over 10 hours.\n To my surprise, the hypervisor loaded successfully, and I was able to dump the six database files from one VM. However, the server suddenly went down, and I was unable to shift the dumped files. I tried again, and after a few attempts, the server worked for two hours before crashing again.\n At this point, I knew I had to act fast. I backed up everything and restored the system the next day, which was a challenging task, but I managed to get it done.\n I'm curious to hear about your experiences with server failures and database recovery. What are some of the worst cases you've encountered? And how did you handle them? Let's share our stories and learn from each other.\n    submitted by    /u/prosaugat  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have another appointment with a doctor that is going to go through some things with me to give me a \"second opinion\" on my conditional diagnosis.\n A month ago when the post was first put out there I read it in full, comments and all, and almost everything that people were putting out there seemed to jive with how I am. \n I dive deep into MANY MANY things/hobbies I'm interested, I misplace things easily, I jump from topic to topic, or task to task at work, and many other things that jived with the post/comments.\n My therapist also explained that many folks who undergo many stressors during a young age, like I was brought up, don't usually get diagnosed with ADHD. Their brains bar for stress is much higher and it's usually chalked up to that. \n I want to thank /u/sobrique for bringing this topic up and leading me down an enlightening path. \n I have recently seen on reddit posts after the above post that ADHD is very heavily linked to alcoholism and I with alcoholism. I don't drink during the day( or even think about drinking alcohol), and only at night a little too much and things have become unmanageable with relationships in my life. I have been seeking help with alcoholism for quite some time, I had a long hiatus from alcohol and fell back in recently after some stressful situations. I am hoping that this diagnosis, with a coupled medication(dopamine levels normalizing, and not partaking), can help me get off of alcohol and get the old me back. \n I have blathered on too long and need to go to bed now. I thank you all for being you and reading my post. Their is hope in this world and I love you all. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/SinceYouWuz  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the last month or so, this has brought something new our way with a series of what I'm quite certain are DDoS attacks. Nothing that would crash Facebook, but HTTP requests for our landing and login pages at a rate of ~1000/second without follow-up for the page's resources. Attacks are happening maybe a few times a week.\n I've been building an IP blacklist from the points of origin, am rate-limiting these pages by IP, and have split login onto its own server, so that when these pages get flooded most of our users are not impacted. All of that has done a lot to mitigate the effects of these attacks.\n What's the long-term game, though? Should I be concerned that we're seeing regular attacks, or is this just a product of seeing more traffic? Are there other measures I should be taking? Can I be a better citizen of the internet by reporting points of origin to somewhere?\n Thank you so much for your thoughts on this!\n    submitted by    /u/base736  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So we have PingID for SSO and MFA and have our M365/Azure authenticate through it. Here recently we've had some key users get locked out of AD constantly. This is because the authentication requests go to our DC to authenticate each SSO authentication, and because it's a brute force attempt, it's constantly locking out those users. \n I reached out on multiple occasions to PingID and they dismissed it as \"non issue\" or pointed the finger back at us. I finally got some escalation and was taken semi-seriously at pointing out this issue (exploit??) and here was there recommendation: \"Turn off AD lockout\" What? So remove a security measure to open up an even bigger risk? Let them brute force the crap out of each user until they get the correct password, then move on to the next steps? Why would we give them that ability? We've asked Ping to provide logs of where the attacks are coming from, IP's, location, something. They refuse to give any. Their dashboard doesn't provide logs because they never (yet) have made it past the first authentication factor. It only logs on second factor.\n Ping recommends buying another product (Ping Federate) to solve this issue, but has not provided any details on how that fixes the issue. We also don't feel we should have to purchase more products from them to fix \"their\" issue.\n Here's where I'm stuck. Azure shows no logs. Purchased Azure AD P2 hoping that would help. No change in Azure AD logs. Nothing showing where the authentication attempts are coming from. Tried various geolocation and IP reputation blocks on Ping, nothing because it doesn't block until second factor. What else could be do to stop the AD Lockouts without \"turning off AD Lockout\" as Ping carelessly suggested? Anyone else experience this with PingID, or another provider?\n    submitted by    /u/Torrch  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was so much demand and pretty much have been treated like garbage. There have been many crying alone days and near a complete mental breakdown. I found a new job and gave my notice and what I feared would happen is happening. They will try to bully me into a consulting deal. I gave them one and a half week notice as I had not clearance yet from new job. They’re saying I have a moral obligation to stay longer to train someone since I’m the only person that knows these systems for years. I told them I will write all documentation necessary. I know they prob asked their lawyer as a lot of legal terminology is used when talking with me so that tells me they’ve been asking their in house lawyer what are their options. They tried to promise matching salary and hiring more ppl but I don’t trust them and they’re bullies. I’m glad I didn’t tell them where I’m going as I’m starting to see their ugly character hidden thinking about ways to threaten me in one way or another. Idk how they do it as I know they’ve bullied others that have resigned into something similar. But I want nothing to do with them. I need to focus on my new job. They’re saying things will break and I leave them in a very bad position.\n Any advice is appreciated to how to handle this situation.

It’s like every time I want to activate a phone it’s a new kind of request they have never handled before and confuses the hell out of them. Also why is the phone call quality to the phone company always so bad? AT&T Internet down? Good look using the “express ticketing” system! You need an “asset ID” to get started and as far as I can tell that information has never been provided to me. Have you ever tried navigating the AT&T portal. It may as well be in an alien language. In one location we have a smaller company that resells AT&T service and a network engineer answers the phone by the third ring. I highly recommend buying AT&T from a company with better customer service. \n A lot of companies just want to kick the ticket back to you by always asking for more stuff. After a week of that, we usually figure out the solution on our own, or just give up. Jamf has been irritating me by doing this lately. \n Microsoft? They have never resolved an issue for me. I don’t even try to get help from them anymore. \n Ring Central. My “customer success manager” doesn’t respond to my emails and has never followed through with anything they promised…not once. \n Shout out to Meraki for being available 24/7 and their level 1 support really knows their stuff. \n Which company has been pissing you off recently?\n    submitted by    /u/oaklandsuperfan  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now that I'm wanting to move away from the MSP, I'm working on implementing our own tools to manage our devices. We are pretty much a Microsoft shop because it's what I'm familiar with. I've already enrolled all of our Windows devices in Azure/Intune and wanting to replace Kaseya. I know there are many unattended remote control solutions that would replace what I primarily use Kaseya for, but one thing I can't seem to find without an RMM is something that gives live device inventory: what PC's are currently on, users that are logged in, IP address of the PC, last reboot time, last agent check in time, and hardware details. Azure/Intune give some but not all of this. Most importantly I'd like to know what computers are on and connected and if anyone is logged in. I'm sure you can run custom scripts with Powershell and/or Microsoft Graph, but looking for something on a web interface. Is this possible with any of Microsoft tooling, and if not, what other solutions would provide what I'm looking for?

Most of our central services is already hosted by an MSP, but not this (and they don't want to).\n So we have an alarm system to mobilize our workforce in an event. Central Server; calls a list of numbers; maybe do it again. I got this system handed over with following specs: old desktop pc; 2 LineCards for connecting to a PBX via ISDN.\n Now we came to a point, where we want to have geo-redundancy and multiple tenants. In the fist meeting we came to the conclusion it would be alright elevate the pc to a VM, connect to the PBX via VoIP (which I already planed). Create a second VM do the same, connect to a second PBX and use the build-in clustering mechanic from the software. Sounds easy enough with an second MSP which is selling the software.\n So my point is: In second thought I remembered there is a cloud solution for this software. Now I'm kinda torn between self-hosting or SaaS. SaaS, would solve my and my team lacking knowledge in PBX-tech and geo-redundancy (or at least outsource it). As the system is kinda critical, I'm questioning the reliabilty of the cloud, which would be better than right now, but if we self-host we can call the internal deskphones without external calling.\n TL;DR: would you move a critical alarmingsystem to the cloud or not?\n    submitted by    /u/GelleSkelle  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Currently, we are using WASP and manually exporting and importing assets into FreshService. Right now API support for our inventory system is non-existent. We are looking for something to replace WASP. We looked at SolarWinds and it had autodiscovery tools for Macs but not for mobile devices which is the majority of our inventory along with Chromebooks. The API support for FS and Jamf is outdated and does not work like we want it to. It would be nice if the users and locations of our devices synced. FS does have an inventory system but we are mainly using it for Ticketing. Any ideas? Thanks!\n Edit: The way I'm hoping it will work is to have Jamf/Sccm/Google sync with the Inventory system and then sync all that information into FS through an API.\n    submitted by    /u/pomoincognito  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got an SMTP relay service setup with verified identities and can send emails successfully. The problem is that usually everything gets hosted on the internal VM(1.1.1.1) in my case or in articles is shown on EC2 instances with Gophish installed, and domain pointing to it. But in my case the internal VM is not open to the internet and connection must go through 2.2.2.2.

We can't use AMD because if licensing. Essentially if you have an AMD Epyc with four chiplets, you need FOUR CPU LICENSES. Yes, really. Which means you would need the Enterprise edition which costs more than I want to know (ranges of tens of thousands of Euros).\n Now that Intel does the same, there are multiple options.\n a) Oracle will change their licensing (highly unlikely) to allow chiplets\n b) It will not apply to the Intel implementation (it is a bit different to AMD)\n c) We start working immediately on moving our product from Oracle\n d) Our customers will need to just buy old, pre 2023 servers.

The argument from the client is that http is a stateless protocol but ftp is a stateful protocol and http will be hampered by the time it needs to reconnect with the server.\n I found that major browsers recently end the supports for ftp and most js ftp clients are in nodejs. So I'm wondering whether it is still possible to connect to ftp server using js. Any web technology that will be able to do that, like web workers, websocket, webRTC?\n If web technology is impossible to do, what are the other options?

No user interaction is required.

          "description": "In recent years, technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning have become increasingly important in practically every aspect of our lives. Based on these technologies, there are also promising identity and access control strategies. But what function do they truly play in identity and access management?\n The use of artificial intelligence to find anomalies in user behavior is one strategy being studied in this context. Algorithms examine user activity within a system and spot any unexpected behaviors that might point to a security problem. In this approach, possible assaults can be discovered and countered at an early stage.\n In the area of authentication, there are also interesting methods based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Systems that examine a user's voice or behavior to confirm their identification are one example of this. With no further user action required, high security authentication can be accomplished in this way.\n The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in identity and access management is, however, being questioned by certain critics. One explanation for this is the possibility of faults with these technology. Users may be mistakenly blocked or unauthorized users may obtain access to secured systems as a result of a flawed system.\n How do you feel? What role do artificial intelligence and machine learning play in identity and access management? Are they a risk or a promising technology? What strategies are already in use, and where do you see room for advancement?\n    submitted by    /u/wsjr_osiris  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know it works because I have it right now working.\n Even with the CORP profile deployed via Intune it doesn't automatically reconnect sometimes and they just see the CompanyNameGUEST and assume its correct. As the GUEST password is on the board room they can connect. \n They then create support tickets saying network shares, apps and things aren't working. The Guest and BYOD are on different VLANS and are blocked from accessing internal resources. I have told them not to connect to Guest or BYOD but ignore me. \n We have had 25 cases so far this year just from the 5 Full Azure AD users regarding Wi-Fi and not able to access stuff and us finding they are on the wrong Wi-Fi. If we extrapolate that over 1000 odd users, we will get a shit load of tickets.\n This was such a simple thing in Group Policy but looks like moving to Intune and the Modern way is costing us more time for support and costing more money as we now need to licence everything and loosing essential features.\n    submitted by    /u/CaterpillarStrange77  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't have an idea drive to plug in and use the backup tool in dos. Though does that back up the whole file system and os like a clone, or does it just back up the files?\n I have a star tech USB to IDE reader and have taken the drive and plugged it into win 11 hoping to use macrium and image it. To my chagrin, and what I should have realized, is I guess win 11 will not read fat16 and it says it's a 2tb drive that needs to be initialized. Obviously that would wipe the data so that wouldn't work.\n Tldr: Need to backup and old dos 6.2 machine and realized that win 11 wouldn't read the data. Pls help.

Has anyone else noticed the atrocious behavior of M365 Apps, specifically Outlook, on the Dell Latitude 3500's? I've had anything from the application simply not opening, to it disconnecting from exchange, and other spontaneous issues. Everything stays up to date and it seems to only affect our 3500's, not our Latitude 5000's. The only way solutions I've found are rebuilding the Outlook profile, M365 repairs, and if all else fails a user profile rebuild. \n I don't mind doing my job and fixing these issues, but it's getting to the point where I'm just genuinely having my time wasted with users having the same Outlook issues over and over again. Hell, I've even completely wiped and redeployed a machine and that same issue happened again. Microsoft has been no help and recent updates have done nothing. \n This is such a simple tier I/II issue that I'm genuinely just getting my time wasted on. I'm tired of running a repair or rebuild every two weeks.\n So, basically, have you guys encountered this?

          "description": "Had an issue last week after installing the February 2023 update (KB502289) on 4 separate devices running Windows Storage Server 2012 R2 that I wanted to pass along, because I haven't been able to find any similar issues out there.\n I believe this actually began back in October/November when we started seeing daily incidences of NETLOGON error 5719 (that we only noticed now, in hindsight). A couple of days after installing KB502289, users complained about data shares not being accessible. We noticed that the ACLs on each server weren't listing domain members, and that led to figuring out that the secure channel/trust relationship was now broken on each of these servers.\n Tried multiple fixes including:\n  \nrolling back update KB502289\n Secure Channel repair\n domain unjoin/rejoin\n  \nNone worked, and we ended up just moving the data off of the servers (as we had planned to retire them later this year anyway) and re-creating the shares. We're still not 100% certain how this could have been remedied if we were forced to keep the servers in production.\n I'm fairly certain that this issue was caused in some part due to Netlogon protocol changes/hardening but I can't prove it, and I'm somewhat concerned about how this could end up affecting other servers in our enterprise further down the line. I know this Netlogon hardening is considered a KABOOM so I've been trying to mitigate against issues, but wasn't anticipating this one.\n    submitted by    /u/Jaymesned  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Data Privacy and Retention Policy of {company they want to refer me to} is available from {link to company they want to refer me to} {company they want to refer me to}.\"\n ​\n  \nThe \"confirm {recruiter company} is my sole representative\" + no time limit for how long is fishy to me. If it were only for the company he's selling me to, I wouldn't really mind though.\n But is it really meant that way? What if I don't accept the role? Would I need to terminate the contract with him/them being my sole representative?\n The link goes to the homepage of {company they want to refer me to}, where I couldn't find the Data Retention Policy. I can understand why they need to refer to the {company they want to refer me to}'s Data Retention policy, since they send my CV over, but wouldn't it make more sense to link to the {recruiter company} Data Privacy and Retention Policy?

We have a request from a client to find a solution that does BOTH patch management (Microsoft patches but also 3rd party apps patches) and vulnerability scanning for about 500 pcs.

It's very slow, freezes a lot, agent deployment does not work 99% of the time, looks very dated, etc.\n I really liked Rapid 7's Insight VM for vulnerability assessment but this doesn't do patch management and the client doesn't want 2 sepparate apps... There's also Qualys that would work and I like it, but they have huge prices, it's enterprise level solution.\n So, in a nutshell, do you know of any solution that can do what I need and doesn't cost my weight in gold? \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/SalamanderAccurate18  \n [link]   [comments]",

Likelihood of Compromise Just being able to link GPOs doesn't provide the whole picture. An attacker would need to find or edit a GPO that contains the instructions they want to achieve.

These are issues that seems to relate to their drivers and the interaction with the rest of the network/print server ecosystem. \n Our experience when contacting the different Copier/Printer suppliers is mostly rejections saying that the issue is with our systems - e.g. once we had a technician connect a laptop directly to the ethernet port on a copier, print a page and conclude that there was not a problem printing to their device. While I can understand the technician's point of view, in regards to his domain with technical support of the copier itself, I am guessing it is fairly few organizations who buy a copier for one person to connect directly to it via ethernet cable.\n Other times they will say we can only use one specific driver without further explanation, even though their own company supplies both Universal and PCL and PS variants.\n We try of course to be diligent in our testing and problem solving, but when we cannot find fault in our systems, we need somebody to turn to. It seems it is very hard to get the suppliers of Copiers/Printers to take what seems to be issues with their drivers and the interaction with other IT systems seriously?\n So I am asking for advice on how you handle issues with copiers, where you have tested different configurations in regards to network, server setup and drivers with no luck\n  \nDo you buy special support from the copier/printer manufacturers?\n Do you have a secret hotline?\n Any other tips?\n  \nThank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Dozy_Dolphin  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are part of companys that are privaty held by one person. No compay helds share of other company, one person is phisical owner of all companys. Also owners wish is that our compay deals with all IT related problem.\n So the problem is, that people from this companys are freaquenty working in some other company ( in this group of companys) and bringing their PC's around, making a mess with licence tracking. It is not realistic, that when a person is tasked to work at other company for a period of time, his PC will be sold to this company and then (after he is finished) soled back to primary company again.\n So our idea is, that my company (IT) would own all the PC's and server, and leasing it to other companys. We can easly track where some PC is (majoraty of month), and invoiced the proper compay for monthy usage of this PC. But i cannot get the information if this kind of bussines model is legal from Microsoft Windows OS stand point? We would like to do the same with servers (Win Srv 2019 Datacenter for hosts and Standard for WMs).\n Can we buy PCs and laptops with OEM Win PRO licence and lease them to other companys?\n Thank you for pointing me in right direction, i will gladly provide additional information.

I think ultimately we'd like a single product for endpoint security, but that may not be possible. \n The most pressing issue is endpoint content filtering and https decryption. We need to be able to control URLs per-user or per-user group, and when we enable certain URLs (office365 for example) we need to re-write http headers to allow login only to certain tenants (similar to this KB: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/tenant-restrictions ) However, we're going to want to control this for more and more cloud providers (adobe cloud, google workspaces, aws, etc) and each has a slightly different way they want the http header re-written to be able to lock down which users can login. \n The above is my most pressing need right now, and cisco umbrella can do this when using the more advanced flavors of the product and the cisco AnyConnect agent on the endpoint, however it's limited to like 6 cloud providers at the moment, and not flexible. \n So please let me know if you have a product you are happy with that can do the above. Now ideally this product would also replace our AV/Firewall/EDR as well, but that's sort of a secondary goal. \n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Helpful_Task7367  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm working for a SMB, the time has come to replace our old fileserver which contains over 20TB of files over the past several years. Currently, this file server's a windows server with multiple SMB shares on for pretty much all work across the business. \n ​\n A new Dell ME5 Powervault has been set up running RAID10 with a single large LUN & volume. I have several queries on the best practice and configuration having only really worked with small setups single hosts, local storage etc. I'd like to ensure this is done properly.\n ​\n 1) Should I just attach the Powervault on iSCSI using windows iSCSI Connect on a VM, then place the NTFS files direct on here? Or would a large VHDX be better for any reason e.g. performance, security, backup then mount this to Hyper-V? Or even multiple smaller VHDX's due to the size? \n 2) Security wise without too much impact on performance what is best e.g. CHAPS, Full disk encryption on the PowerVault, separate VLAN between the Powervault and Hypervisor? This would be done using a core switch, I don't have separate hardware I could use for isolation. \n 3) Is robocopy still the best method using MIR or /XO and ran before and after cut-off of the old server shares?\n 4) Any other advise on best practices and security?\n    submitted by    /u/Imagination6942  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can copy a few GB from the same device to the server in less time with finder. If saved locally InDesign saves instantly.

          "description": "Hi Folks,\n I am going to struggle to articulate what I'm looking to achieve here because I'm not sure how I go about this. \n We currently have a suite of software delivered by a third party application - kind of like adobe creative cloud but for engineering.\n Now we had a policy change that means we no longer allow any user to be a local admin group member on any client endpoint. We instead use LAPS for the odd occasion when admin right sis needed.\n Before this policy change, the software suite was run via a service whose user was in every local admin group on all user endpoints, so this service no longer works and we're struggling to use other methods such as intune due to the size of the applications etc.\n So I guess what my question is, how do I make a service have the ability to run things as an administrator in the users login? \n The applications we install are all based on a network share and currently I run the application as the local (LAPS) administrator and then pass user credentials to access the share. Very clumsy. The alternative I have setup for now is a script that deploys via intune its mounts a drive as system using hardcoded user credentials in the script to mount the share as a drive then manually running a shortcut for the executable (this is hit and miss). \n My assumption is to run the service as system, but I don't think that this would be able to access network shares and also be able to interact with the user session for the install.\n Apologies if this is not very clear.\n    submitted by    /u/Hudson0804  \n [link]   [comments]",

Supposing (hypothetically ) the adversaries derived private key from public, what are those keys used for? What the attacker can do with that?

Nobody dare question him because he confuses them with jargon and gets majorly defensive. \n It’s making the job really rubbish, it feels like one vicious circle. User requests support with purchasing new software > user complained about IT once > we refuse to assist them > user buys new system themselves anyway > system gets implement with no support from us, constant roadblocks, dragging our heels > poor end users get issues and ring for help, we refuse.

We are using a \"Zulty's\" system that has a phone app you can download, but half the time it doesn't seem to work.\n For example, if you receive a phone call, answer it, then end the call, you have to be sure you re-open the app, or else you will be stuck on \"On the phone\" status, meaning any additional phone calls will not ring to the app until you open the app again.\n So, my question is, has anyone ever had to deal with a situation where you need to route it through something else? Even if it is to route it through something like Google Voice, etc. we are dealing with a call group (our helpdesk line) that is hit or miss if the person on-call is receiving the phone call, because the app is terrible.\n My experience with VoIP is limited as you may be able to tell, but any suggestions are great. We can't move to another system with just that number / phone group as it's a part of a contract, however just being able to get a phone call through something whether it's through another app that is better would make our lives so much easier.\n Thanks if you have any ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/Steelersrawk1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our organization has been using Exchange Server 2016 for several years now, and we implemented a hybrid deployment with Office Online. This allows us to have the benefits of both on-premises and cloud-based Exchange, including password and directory synchronization. \n However, as we continue to evaluate our IT infrastructure, we are considering moving to Exchange Online only.

We transmit some of these as SAML attributes currently, sending what is relevant to each service provider.\n Most of these users are low value, not paying customers or employees and the client deemed Okta too expensive, I don't think they'd go above $0.25 per user but they'll happily pay tens of thousands for us to set up something free.\n It's not exactly my wheelhouse and I'd be doing this entirely on my own with a restrictive timeline/budget so I need some advice.

But we got about 40 servers from Lenovo about two years ago, and they have been nothing but a constant headache. Which fine, A bad firmware here, a faulty driver there, it has happened with all of them. The problem comes down to the support. \n Their support has NO clue what they are doing, Every time we call in, we have to explain the situation to them multiple times, We demonstrate the problem to them, and they cannot comprehend what the issue is. Like they've never done break/fix before in their lives, and so troubleshooting steps are foreign to them. Their knee jerk reaction to any issue is a motherboard swap. We've had the motherboard on a system replaced 7 and 8 times without resolving the very obviously firmware issue. \n The techs they send out are all contract, and other than replacing system boards have no knowledge or desire to do anything beyond swapping boards, there have been several times they have failed to update serial numbers and other things (I believe they have all been IBM techs). \n The newest experience has me laughing, We opened a ticket for a power supply gone bad, and they somehow confused us with another company, and Now we're invited to a teams meeting monday for their issue. \n Has anybody had a good experience with Lenovo support for servers? any tips? \n When I did desktop support, I LOVED Lenovo thinkpad support, they had amazing support processes, and super knowledgeable people, fast response times, etc. It has been the exact opposite with the servers.\n    submitted by    /u/aroundincircles  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I launched a software licensing service not that long ago. As a Software Vendor (I made a desktop app that I was looking to to sell), I found existing Software Licensing solutions (FlexLM, Sentinel, Wibu, Nalpeiron) were either prohibitively expensive to adopt and difficult to use, or just didn't have sufficiently robust capability.\n I think looking at it from the software Vendor's perspective is only part of the problem, since many end users also complain about licensing (more so than the vendors!). Looking through other threads, some of the big issues that kept coming up seem to be:\n - Easier to \"steal\" rather than install and activate correctly\n - Difficult to get buy in from higher ups to switch to a software with easier to work with licensing policies. We're talking monolithic On-Prem License servers with UI from the 90s that have never been updated used to enforce concurrency.\n - There is no single agreed upon standard, every ISV might have their own definitions for floating licenses, a seat, or a user-based license provisioning. This inconsistency makes SAM automation a nightmare.\n - ISVs sometimes prefer to prevent piracy rather than deploy in an environment that they cannot control (in a VM, for example).\n - Hardware Dongles aren't going away.\n - Node Locking fails often for many reasons (MAC address isn't persistent; you attach a new dock and the device fingerprint changes etc.). \n What else could be improved to make licensing software less of a headache for everyone? #opensource\n    submitted by    /u/LicenseSpring  \n [link]   [comments]",

Concepts like ticketing systems, remoting systems, and no access to admin for the average user is very foreign to them. I'm the single IT guy for about 300 users. This division has many departments.\n Active Directory was a mess. I've mostly straightened that out and reorganized OUs and such. They finally agreed to the purchase of a ticketing system. That got funded today....Really happy about that. I am sick of getting calls, emails, team messages, skype messages, texts, and office pop-ins. They are finally receptive to purchasing a remoting system. \n But what really pushes my buttons are that the Leadership is stubborn on wanting all users to have administrative access to everything! I've showed them university SOPs. I've cited my state's government SOPs on admin credentials. I've told them I do not fill comfortable trading convenience for security. \n My reasoning for posting this would be to ask for advice.

They specified that the email has to be able to send encrypted messages and multiple users need to be able to read and reply back to emails from it. No problem! we can set it up as a shared mailbox, and enable encryption on it.\n However, a phone call with the user, she also now mentions that she also needs her front desk to be able to log into the account to send scanned documents from this email and not just a shared email. This makes it a little more complicated because you now have to have a license attached to it for it to be logged into. No worries though, we can do this we just enable MFA (Now that it's going to be physically able to be logged into), give read/send permissions to the needed users so they can access from their email, and enable Encryption on the email. All done!\n Third call with the user comes, she now mentions that the email will be used for SMTP from a 3rd party with their application that they use to send out contracts, documents, etc. This is where it gets complicated, I have no idea how to keep this email secure with MFA (As far as my understanding, SMTP will not work with MFA enabled), we now can't change the password, or it's going to break the application from sending emails, and now we have 4 different people inside of this email that has access to personal, sensitive information.\n So my question is, how would you go about it to make this account secure and meet the requirements. We can make another account if needed and makes sense to do so.\n Requirements\n 1) Allow SMTP\n 2) Possibly Disable Login, if not then enable MFA.\n 3) Allow shared account access from multiple users.\n    submitted by    /u/Ihaterenames  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been a Systems Engineer previously for about 10 or so years.\n I can either go back to my old job possibly but no one on my team is there aside from two people, or try to find a new job that is remote only. I've been fortunate that my last 2 jobs out of 3, I've put my heart in and have gotten promotions and been able to do things that helped the company. With my latest it's just not the same.\n Has anyone been in the same boat? There are some people that got me here at my current job and I feel like I might burn bridges but I want to have that fire back in. I just feel like I work best devoted my time to fix things at a company as opposed to coming in, doing a project and leaving. I hate the feeling of starting a project with a bunch of new people and rinsing and repeating with other new people. It causes so much anxiety for me. I prefer to go to midsize company and pave the road and make a name for myself (based on my previous jobs this has worked out...)\n    submitted by    /u/PepeTheMule  \n [link]   [comments]",

Stand up for yourselves and stop letting douchebags tell you how to perform, what to do and do things that aren't in your job description. \n It's amazing how many people bend over backwards, skip lunch and drive themselves up a wall for selfish assholes who don't give a single fuck about you or your mental wellbeing.

          "description": "Obligatory sorry for grammar/punctuation as I am on mobile.\n I put up a post over a year ago complaining about policy and management at my job, you can view on my profile. TLDR of that post was management was changing policy flip flopping back and forth and making our jobs harder because of it.\n I spent a lot of time at the old place complaining, and wallowing in my self pity. Thinking that I wasnt good enough and that there was no way another company would hire me. I blamed management for my unhappiness which is partially true but in the end it was my fault for staying and letting them make me unhappy.\n On the flip side yesterday I had my 6 month review at my new job that went spectacular. I found a place that is supportive and listens to employees to improve the company. It's not perfect by any means but no where really is. Since I've been here my mental health has improved, I've been eating better and I've lost ~60lbs. I'm learning more than ever and have the ability to move up in the company.\n Please remember that no job is worth your health. If you are not happy or your health, both physical or mental is declining, leaving is better than staying. Yes I'm aware that is easier said than done it took me almost 10 months to decide and actively look for another job but it worked out in the end.\n    submitted by    /u/S_Cubed20  \n [link]   [comments]",

The master server setup and inventory is quite easy and the box is easily screwed down re: the security as far as OS and access for certain groups, correct access rights, logging, locked down firewalls as well. You know, the sane usual settings.\n One thing that really worries me is the fact that in order to use the Ansible setup properly we are going to have to create keys that have no password, are exempted from 2FA rules and can switch to root level access. \n The information on these servers \"is the business\" so if our data got lost it would be the end of the business if that makes sense. If the box got compromised it would be game over.\n In order to get the key they would have to exploit some creds to get into the box but its the sheer lateral movement/access that is gotten if these keys are misappropriated that worries me.\n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/IT_ISNT101  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope someone might be able to help me.\n ​\n Following scenario: We have a Microsoft 365 tenant with Exchange Online and an on-prem Active Directory (NO AD Connect). So at the moment we always have to create two users: one for the M365 tenant / Exchange Online and one user for the on-prem AD.\n ​\n Is it possible to merge the on-prem AD users with the M365 users? I did find some tutorials on how to configure Azure AD Connect using soft and hard matching. BUT: I also read on some forum, that you must have an on-prem exchange in order for it to work properly (no further information was given). This on-prem Exchange is just used for communication between Exchange Online and the on-prem environment (no mailboxes etc. needed). How do I have to configure that on-prem Exchange? Just install it, configure hybrid mode and start creating users withing on-prem Exchange? Do I have to license the on-prem Exchange?\n ​\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ZekeShouldVape  \n [link]   [comments]",

My plan over the course of the next month was to Fully migrate away from the on Prem server anyway as there is no need for it any more. All of our Microsoft services are cloud based. We have no on site applications. All machines are connected via Azure and linked up to intune. So really all we use the on Prem server for is creating accounts. \n My question is... What would the implications be of just leaving the server in its current state seeing as though I was going to be getting rid of it anyway.

We use it like you you would use a vmware or any other hypervisor to just run VMs. Nothing special no fancy services or scripting. \n When I say every single upgrade I have done has failed or taken 8+ hours for something that should be 2 at the most, I mean every single upgrade. I can't find a single redeeming quality to this system. Every issue requires SSH access to the controller VMs, and either a pile of CLI or direct intervention from their support staff. In a 10+ year career I've never talked to support so much in such a short amount of time. Every firmware upgrade of the underlying host turns into a multi hour nightmare with crazy 2+ hour timeouts before a failure message. Every single feature down to what should be the simplest thing is manual, or a ratking of python scripts behind a sleek UI with bad progress reporting. Something as easy as upgrading the VM guest tools is a manual process with no automation. \n I don't understand, what's the value add?

Yikes!\n To cut a long story short, our security stack has contained the threat and the single device in question is nuked – We looped in 3rd party security to sense check everything.\n The threat was a Gootloader infection and Google suggests this is particularly nasty and sophisticated. The payload is a zip file with a .js file inside and from our investigation, the .js script needs to be executed, launched via WScriptexe. We implement best practice in our IT stack and are on-top of hardening our environment where ever possible. In this instance the payload was downloaded to a temp directory where Applocker blocks execution. But had the zip/.js file been downloaded to the desktop, it would have potentially executed.\n 1 suggested rudimentary mitigation for this is to change the file association of .js files (via Group Policy) to open with Notepad so if a user does click a .js file, it will harmlessly open in notepad - We have done this. \n But I have seen further recommendations to do the same for .vbs, .vbe, .jse, .hta and .wsf.

The kicker is that the company that this phone belongs to doesn't exist anymore and so we are unable to get an admin to unlock the phone. Furthermore, I have contacted SOTI directly and because the company doesn't exist anymore they don't have permission to unlock it so they can't help me.\n I can't seem to figure out a way to unlock it - they have me beat at every turn.\n - Developer options is blocked\n - In recovery mode, there is no option to factory reset the phone\n - I am able to get into the settings for about a minute before the mobicontrol kicks in when I restart the phone - otherwise settings is completely disabled\n - The factory reset setting is completely greyed out.\n - In recovery mode, the bootloader is blocked out | when I try to open it, it just says downloading forever with a green screen\n Any methods I can try to get this phone reset or alternatively get soti mobicontrol off the device?

          "description": "Without going into detail, I gave a family member of mine a beautiful enterprise laptop that I got for free out of a HW refresh a few years ago. For some reason this relative decided rather than going to me when they had a problem they would run straight to the local \"repair shop\" as he apparently was chatted up by one of their staff while he was at the chippy.\n This \"repair shop\" (and I use this dubiously) has made a fucking botch to put it lightly. They claimed he had a virus and that his \"hard drive\" (actually an SSD) was destroyed by it and he would need a replacement which he happily agreed to. They installed a \"new\" hard drive and sent it back to him, obviously with slower performance on acc. of having an SSD swapped for a HDD and no effort made to reinstall any of the laptop's basic drivers which can be pulled off the manufacturer's site with a few minutes on Googles, so this relative had no sound, no WiFi (lucky they use a cable connection, really!) and a prompt to activate Windows.\n When they took it back, they had the sense to call me this time. When I went back with this relative, they had kindly replaced his hard drive with a \"solid state drive\" and would only charge him £150, what a fucking deal! I actually had a look at the laptop at the shop and it was in the same state as before, no effort to reinstall any drivers, probably was just the same SSD they took out reinstalled and sold back to him at cost, and a prompt to activate Windows. I quite bluntly told them to fuck off, gave them an earful and walked out with my relative and the laptop in tow. Considering either legal or lethal action to get these tw@s to stop bothering him.\n Also, the fucking screws are threaded on the underside so good luck to me getting into that fucker again. At least they had the decency to install another SSD but that's nearly £100 of this relative's money down the fucking drain.\n    submitted by    /u/WindowScam2023  \n [link]   [comments]",

They have to connect with one of the other session hosts. On that session host it works for 1-2 days and afterwards the same issue occurs.\n The software is not installed on the vms but is started directly from a mapped network drive. It doesn't add or edit registry keys and only caches files in one specific folder in AppData. We already excluded that folder from the FSLogix redirection but it didn't make a difference.\n The only solution that works is to delete the FSLogix profile and create a new one.\n Additionally, Excel doesn't seem to work great either. Users have to restart it every few minutes because of freezing and crashing. Same thing, if the FSLogix profile will be deleted and be newly created it works again for a few days.\n So it seems there is something wrong with FSLogix. We already updated to the newest version and tried both normal caching and cloud cache.\n Weirdly I couldn't find anything or anyone on google regarding to this issue.\n Did anyone of you experience similiar issues or has an idea how to fix this? \n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/_Xephyr_  \n [link]   [comments]",

ServerA isn't in our control and is difficult to get any traces from. On the left FW there are no rules, it only terminates the VPN connection. The right side of the VPN and its FW is in our control and allows some tcp-ports and ICMP. MTU size of the interfaces on the FW are 1500.\n Especially the difference in behaviour around size 1397, where normal pings suddenly start working again until 1473. This differs per connection, on my normal home wifi I see above behaviour, when connecting to a 4G hotspot (either tethered or via wifi to a 4G router), there are no ICMP replies from 1395 onwards.

We are a small company with little focus on security, but I'm aiming to improve our situation.\n Best practices are certainly not being followed and I'm just now digging into how to get us to a good spot. I've recently enabled URL and Application monitoring for our lan to wan policy. App monitoring is requesting deep inspection, but it seems the impact of doing so must be considered.\n - Any advice for whether to enable deep inspection or not?\n - Should antivirus be enabled on our lan-to-wan policy with out-of-the-box defaults? What about DNS filter?\n - Can I setup alerts to fire when a \"monitored\" category URL is hit? Or can you only fire alerts on a blocked URL?\n What would be your recommendations if you had a \"new\" Fortigate firewall dropped in your lap? I'm willing to consider some of the subscriptions Fortinet offers, such as Forticloud/Fortianalyzer, if the value is there.\n The current goal is to increase visibility into user activity. We don't regularly monitor, but in the event we want to check on someone's activity, we want that ability. Right now I'm struggling to glean meaningful info from our App/URL monitoring and can't find a way to filter by categories (such as adult categories or suspicious/blocked URLs).\n I'm going to be taking this one step at a time, so any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n (Let me know if this is far too broad a topic for this subreddit)\n    submitted by    /u/infosecspec  \n [link]   [comments]",

They don't run redundant internet circuits at the majority of these sites, so I have steered them away from expensive SDWAN solutions to accompany their SASE purchase; I don't see any value in branch SDWAN appliances if they are single-circuit for the foreseeable future.\n My question is: has anyone out there found a relatively low cost, IPSec capable, cloud-managed router with some level of enterprise support available? A good low touch provisioning workflow would be a big bonus as well. These devices would strictly be used to feed traffic from branch sites into the selected SASE solution via IPSec tunnel. We would either do a static default on the branch routers, or distribute a default via an IGP. The SASE solution will double as their WAN in this case, for branch-to-branch connectivity.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/tilphecklenburg  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lately I have some free time and I would like to learn new things and do some certifications, but I'm not sure which way to go. \n From one side I'm planning to do a Linux certification: I have general knowledge I picked up during my work, but it would be nice to have a more in-depth understanding in the system. I think it's still the foundation of IT. Which certification would you recommend? CompTIA or LPI?\n From the networking side, first I was thinking going for a Cisco or Juniper certification, but then I found Wireshark exam. Every now and then we hit problems where packet analysis is necessary and I only have basic knowledge in that, but once the data is gathered by others it's fun to solve the issue by completely understanding the traffic behavior. \n So I did check this WCNA certification, but to be honest it feels a bit like an abandoned exam. The books are outdated and their website as well. What is your opinion on WCNA?\n    submitted by    /u/th0rnfr33  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please review the platform datasheet on the HPE web site or contact your HPE sales rep for a list of supported transceivers.\n  \nAnd not work DDM and is not possible to read manufacturer information (S/N and date code).\n I've some generic code, with which module works better. Works DDM, but in manufacturer info is a \"generic\" serial number and date code. I have found the following about the code:\n Block A0h:\n  \nin bytes 60h - 62h is string \"H3C\"\n bytes 63h - 74h are set to 00h\n in bytes 75h - 7Fh are some hexacodes, I don't know their meaning.\n  \nIn block A2h in page 02h is H3C (HP?) specific code:\n  \nbytes 80h - 93h is serial number (ASCII)\n bytes 94h, 95h are set to 00h\n bytes 96h - 9Dh is date code (ASCII)\n bytes 9Eh - FFh are a mystery to me\n  \nSmall problem is that serial number and date code are at two positions. At standard positions in A0h block and at H3C (HP) specific positions in A2h block, page 02. If I insert module to \"generic\" switch, informations from A0h block are read. If I insert module to H3C/HP switch, i get informations from A2h block. If I change serial number and/or date code in A2h block, H3C/HP switch don't identify module as HP compatible any moreSomewhere is some checksum / hash.\n My question is - know anyone exact structure of data in A0h block at addresses 60h - 7Fh and in block A2h (page 02h) at addresses 80h - FFh? Is there a SFP module code with another structure that will work in switch HP/H3C A5800?\n Thanks,\n Zbynek\n    submitted by    /u/zburget  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ok. So, I currently have 144 small mini computers (actually, 2021 Apple TV 4Ks) with a bespoke app in single-app mode that are used on film sets for displaying graphics on computer screens, with remote loading of content and a control protocol for color correction, etc.\n Works great.\n The issue I have is with the # that can be simultaneously powered on at a time and associate with an AP. I have found that Qualcomm's Networking Pro 1200 platform within a (wait for it..) Ubiquiti Amplifi Alien on channel 165 works great for my use-case. Channel 165 is the only channel I have available for use on a film set. All others are unavailable, especially DFS channels. These are never available, because of Teradek Bolt camera wireless video systems.\n On the Alien, I can easily power on 100 or so Apple TVs and they associate fine. But, beyond this number, I need to space them out by several minutes. If I wait a few minutes, I can easily get 144 client associations and everything works fine and dandy. But, the inability to power them all on simultaneously could be a problem. On some sets, this would be impractical, because the power for the entire set is turned off at wrap, and turned on at call time the next day. So, ideally, I'd be able to have 150-200 associations happen seamlessly and without delay.\n So, question is: what other vendors are using this Qualcomm Networking Pro 1200 chipset with 8x8:8 MU-MIMO on 802.11ax in an AP that perhaps has a quicker client association time?\n Had my eyes on a Ruckus R850, perhaps with a Netgear M4250 AV Line switch (model # GSM4210PD-100NAS) which has a built-in DHCP server, as we've had very good results with this series of switches generally.\n Thoughts?

Two issues with that are how to dynamically handle the exceptions for what is not tunneled and public WIFI connections that redirect to a captive portal to accept terms before allowing a user out to the internet. For whatever reason, EDL's can't be used to define tunneling exceptions.\n My consideration of the Windows client is mostly driven by the ability to manage it with group policy and possibility to be a more seamless experience for users.\n    submitted by    /u/Smeetilus  \n [link]   [comments]",

The cost of the equipment wasn't a problem. A logical amoubt for a membership will not be a problem. So i created the network with 4 ubiquiti switches, a MikroTik 48 port PoE switch and a CCR-1016-12G and 2 WANs for redunduncy. I would like to keep all of the existing setup. Please note that the firewall on the MikroTik is well configured, and there is port security on each switch. \n My question is: would you adding any kind of firewall before the MikroTik router - something like a NGFW or some kindof IPS/IDS? I feel that the mikrotik firewall rules just don't cut it for today's standards and network moniroting and/or blocking is necessary. What kind of firewall could i add before the existing router that could filter trafic before it reaches the internal network?\n Basically it seems like i might need a transparent firewall.\n    submitted by    /u/Several_Drummer_6561  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe one of you can help me.\n For a shake test of an RJ45 to fiber optic converter, it must be checked for correct functionality during the simulated earthquake.\n What do I have in mind: My idea would be the following structure... Laptop -> (RJ45 cable) -> Converter -> (FO loop TX to RX)\n https://ibb.co/vLvQz5R\n Now I think I know that the UDP protocol is one-way and I can use a python script with the socket library to send a UDP packet over the laptop's ethernet interface to itself over the loop with the converter.

When an incorrect password is entered on a client device I would expect a 'Password:' request message to be sent by the TACACS+ server, a reply from the client containing the password, and then a 'password incorrect' message back from the server. This does indeed happen, but then immeadiately afterward the client sends the password for a second time, despite me only having entered it once. This goes to happen a further two times before the server eventually sends a 'authentication failed' and it all stops. Resulting in a total of 4 messages being sent by the client containing the password (again at this point I have only entered it once). \n This wouldn't normally be a problem except we are authenticating TACACS against AD, which locks out users after 3 incorrect password attempts. Because the TACACS+ client sends the password a total of 4 times, the users is immidiately locked out of their AD account if they enter their password incorrectly just once.\n I'm seeing the same behavoir on both Nokia and Juniper (mx, srx, qfx) clients, and have now replicated it in a lab using a completely different TACACS+ server (TACGUI) and the junos olive image. I'm also very confident it is not the SSH client as it happens with putty, secureCRT, mobaXterm, and the buildin ssh client on a Linux box.\n I'm really stumped as to what is causing these clients to send the password a total or four times, even though it has already been rejected, and the user is not entering it again. Is this expected behavoir? Can I stop it? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\n Regards,\n Frustrated Network Engineer\n    submitted by    /u/jnewto31  \n [link]   [comments]",

These are then routed to the firewall via a separate transfer network.\n At the moment, the throughput of the firewall is not a problem, but since we can connect servers with higher speed due to the new hardware, there could be an increase.\n What is the best way to implement this in the data centre in terms of security? How do you do it? Maybe someone can give me some comments and recommendations.\n    submitted by    /u/lolaoosljslolul  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll try and describe it as best as I can not to waste your time.\n ​\n We have been experiencing issues with websites timing out for a while now. It is sporadic and doesn't happen on any particular websites. It can be one website sometimes, then it works fine 5 minutes after, and then five minutes after the website working before, times out now. One thing that seems consistent is when a website times out, it seems to be able to load afterwards.\n ​\n There is no real other network impact, internal seems to be fine, servers seem to be running fine internally. \n Pinging is no issue, NSlookup is no issue.\n I've noticed that when trying to load a website, it may be very slow but connecting anyway. In Devtools it will have a stalled time on 15+ seconds and the rest seems perfectly fine.\n We have a setup of 4 MS250, 2 MS425, 2 MX84. Everything is completely firmware updated and have tried restarts just to make sure. \n We've had 2 different network consultants come and have a look at it, with no luck. I've written to our ISP but the issue seems to be non existent when connecting directly to our Edge router, so they're positive the issue is at our end, and the consultants are positive the issue is at the ISP end. \n We are at a loss, and this is why I turn to reddit in my final hour of sanity.

I'm attempting to place ACLs inbound and outbound on all my VLANs, but I keep running into an error that there aren't enough hardware resources. In talking to Ruckus support, it came to light that the hardware limits on outbound ACLs are much tighter than inbound ACLs. In the Ruckus world (not sure if this applies to other brands as well) inbound means traffic going into the switch from the VLAN and outbound means going into the VLAN from the switch which brings me to my question...\n Is it normal or best practice to have ACLs on each VLAN in both directions? It seemed like the most secure thing to do to me, but if switches are built with more resources available for inbound ACLs (from the VLAN to the switch), is it best practice to only use inbound ACLs? Are these Ruckus switches just garbage?\n Any help on this would be appreciated.

First burden was to add 4 switches to a MLAG. Its restricted to 2 switches. Then there was an issue with connecting both MlAG pair with each other. It created a loop, even tho configured as stated in their documentary and made everything to shit down. \n Connecting distribution layer was a mess to. It looped again due to a bug with STP. Since you have no real centralized management, we had to troubleshoot on Firewall GUI, CLI and Switch CLI. You can completely forget about the Fortimanager integration. \n Accsess layee integration got its own bugs. Since were running a split vendor environment right now, we had problems connecting the switches to the 1048Es 10gig lwl ports. Had to do some config adjustments on the old switches too. \n Configuring these switches is verry „interesting“ too as Im used to CLI only. The CLI itself is nothing compared to Ciscos or Junipers. Though I like there firewall configuration, the switch controller GUI seems to be buggy as well. Some menues doesnt show all options so you have to increase window size to actually view everything. The topology view is buggy too as you cant even scroll in on large deployments. \n Overall it has not been a pleasure dealing with this devices.

On average there's only about 70 users on site, but it peaks to ~350 with guests etc.\n I've been in talks with Aruba for a while, and they've finally given me their solution, which is 2x CX6300M and 6x CX6100 which is coming in at over £100K MSRP. Originally they spec'd CX6400 at almost £220K!\n Their issue is the lead time is 36 Weeks at best for the 6300, and 15 Weeks for the 6100.\n The second option is to go UniFi, I've already got an extensive UniFi wireless system already and we're sticking with Unifi for the wireless in the new building. I'll probably still stick with an Aruba 2930 at the core acting as the layer 3 router - I'm also looking at firewall options between Sonicwall and rolling my own PFSense on HPE server hardware for layer3 routing.\n The UniFi solution of 2x USW-Enterprise-48 and 6x USW-Pro-48-PoE is almost 1/5th the cost at less then £20K, obviously it lacks a lot of the features of the Aruba, and their Layer 3 stuff is laughably bad.But at 1/5th the cost, and being able to get it with only 1 weeks lead time, is this a good option or am I crazy?\n For the money I could by a cold spare of every Unifi switch and still be half the cost of the Aruba option.\n    submitted by    /u/thejonson  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I am browsing this subreddit almost daily and I would like to suggest a new type of post. This will have engineers giving their opinions about a (fairly) new technology that they have actually implemented and their opinion.\n An example of a valid post will be:\n - We currently have Cisco DNA Center, and backing up this product is horrible (among everything else). You can select a backup destination, an NFS mount, but it does not have the option to \"keep x amount of backups\" or \"keep the last X backups\". Upon researching, I have found a bash script written by a Cisco engineer where you put it on the NFS server (its a bash script), deleting backups older than X amount of days. I realized that if backup was failing for a couple of weeks in a row and I was on holiday or forgot to check the backups on a daily basis, that script would delete all backups. It is such a bad design.\n ​\n Examples of bad posts are:\n - Vendor X has announced technology Y. This is a marketing/sales post where it was not a tested feature.\n - I have reused my old Cisco 2950s for OoB management. This is an old way of doing things with an even older technology.\n    submitted by    /u/awesome_pinay_noses  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll be using Cisco MDS 9148T's to replace the Nexus box's.\n The part that has thrown me, is although there is a port-channel trunk setup between the switches they have different vsans on each switch (trunk only allows their vlan so the neighbour switch will drop)... this would technically still work but i cant help but think it isnt best practice? \n i would have thought you have both switches configured with the same vsan and a trunk between them? \n If anyone has any examples of best practice for this senario it would be much appricated. \n TL:DR - How should i configure 2 resilient FC switches with each server/storage having a connection to both switches.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Shizles  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I'm working on a project where I need to connect a workstation in one town to a workstation in a different town. I am creating the project completely virtually (in Microsoft Hyper-V), with servers acting as routers.\n For each network, I've created a server, switch and client that can communicate with each other, but I can't seem to get them to communicate between networks. As far as I know, the only tools I can use in the scenario are Windows based, so I've been trying to use RRAS, but haven't had any luck. I don't need to worry about an internet connection at all, so I've just been attempting a static route between the servers/routers.\n I've created this diagram (https://imgur.com/a/6D4VvNZ - sorry for poor quality). I basically need a client (192.168.1.1) to talk to another client (192.168.2.1). They can both talk to their servers (192.168.1.254 / 192.168.2.254) but I can't get the servers to talk to eachother. I have two NICS on each server/router, one with the private IP address and one with the public IP address (173.15.15.x/30).\n Has anyone got any ideas where I might be doing wrong?\n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Road-Boring  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a feeling it's something really basic, and I'm just spacing on the problem completely.\n Any assistance would be appreciated.\n Note: I cannot add any routing rules, or otherwise change the router at 172.55.1.1\n    submitted by    /u/TiggerLAS  \n [link]   [comments]",

In a DR scenario, in my DR site I can bring up and advertise matching subnets/SVIs matching those from my production site - who theoretically just got blown up and is unreachable. I can bring up my VMs and infrastructure through replication. My MPLS provider speaks EIGRP with me so I can reannounce that 10.0.0.0/22 now lives in DR. This is all fine and tested.\n My issue is that in a test scenario where I want to bring up VMs and test them on their original subnets - I’m curious how you folks would handle this. Would you advertise with a lower metric and risk a split brain routing scenario (scary)? Would you suppress advertisements until you’re ready to be in a DR scenario (seems safer)?\n I can comfortably automate these types of changes via Cisco scripting/my choice of automation front end. I just want to be able to test these VMs from a sandbox in DR that you can get to via a jump box.\n Open to all ideas and possibilities!

I have a doubt regarding the primary node failure.\n This is the configuration: sw-core1 is the primary node, sw-core2 is the backup node. Peer routing is enabled on both nodes.\n Both switches contains VLAN 40 and VLAN 50 with an ip address assigned. sw-core1 is the default gateway for the devices inside VLAN 40 and VLAN 50.\n These are the tests performed:\n When both switches are powered on devices on VLAN 40 can ping the devices on VLAN 50 as expected.\n When one switch are powered off (failure scenario) PC on VLAN 40 can ping the PC on VLAN 50 as expected.\n If during a failure scenarion of the primary node (sw-core1 powered down) I restart the backup node (sw-core2) after the boot I cannot ping any device indefinitely. Only powering on the sw-core1 restore the comunication.\n Is this a correct behavior or I'm missing something in the configuration? It could be a normal behavior because at the startup sw-core2 has only the ip assigned locally and cannot synchronize with sw-core1. So, the backup node cannot know the IPs assigned to the sw-core1 interfaces.\n Thank you. Regards.\n    submitted by    /u/Illustrious_Big9830  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A have large site network that, once upon a time, needed 21 MST instances. Over the years, the topology was consolidated so that one of two core switches became the root bridge for every VLAN at the site. The appropriate number of MST instances for us to have today is two.\n We knock down and stand up subnets all the time, and every time we do, we have to pick an unused VLAN tag that is already mapped to one of the 21 MST instances—which is fine, but the instances have no bearing to what we actually do. When an engineer asks, \"Which instance should I pull this tag from?\" the answer is, \"Whichever you want.\" Consequently, things are so mixed up that we'd have to not only create a new MST region, but basically start over with our VLAN tag/subnet associations to get them into the correct one of the two new instances.\n I'm not clinically OCD, but I hate inefficiency and inconsistency. Hate. It. If this were a small business, I'd be willing to substantially inconvenience my life to clean this up during maintenance windows. But this is a site that has hundreds of VLANs, 600 users, a datacenter with 80 server racks, and a significant internet presence. When a city has poor road design, we all live with it because it's impossible to fix without knocking the city down. I'm thinking this might be one of those situations. I've never tried to fix an MST region before, but I know it can't be done without downtime. And literally the only people who even know about this inconvenience are the network team. Cleaning it up will not noticeably improve network function.\n Do you agree that we should just deal with it forever?

We've hit a good point in our switching and would like to move on to our wireless.

Can I use the same NPS I use for the main network for the MAC ACL on the unsecured network? 2. If I register a MAC for the unsecured wireless network, can I dynamically assign a VLAN similar to security groups with my main network? 3. Will I need a web server for the FSD_Setup network or will my WLC (UniFi) do the trick? \n Basically, I'd like these scenarios to be true:\n Scenario #1: A student brings their own device. They connect to FSD_Setup, click AGREE on the site and it redirects them to a site that downloads the certificate and shows screenshots and instructions for importing it. After importing it, they connect to the FSD network, type in their AD username and password, then, boom! They are now on the Student-Wireless VLAN and can do their assignments.\n Scenario #2: A teacher needs a Chromecast setup to cast to their TV. I take the physical address written on the back, log in to my server and register the device. On the setup wizard for the Chromecast, I join FSD_Unsecured and am now on the TV VLAN.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Nbommersbach  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are running ACI version 4.2, which is acting as the transit for an NSX-T platform. Due to the implementation of the NSX solution, all of the ESXi hosts are both compute and edge nodes. So, the Edge VMs can shuffle around on the whole ESXi cluster. What this causes in 4.2 ACI, that we need to configure connected ESXi hosts * 2 BGP connectivity profile on each leaf of ours.\n Now this can be fixed with floating L3out on ACI version 5.2, but currently we are in the middle of APIC upgrade and then Fabric upgrade is next. (Corporate politics postponed this longer than should have).\n We realized as a new customer is coming, that we are getting to the advised limit by Cisco on 4.2 ACI.Verified Scalability Guide for Cisco APIC, Release 4.2(2), Multi-Site, Release 2.2(2), and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-Mode Switches, Release 14.2(2) - CiscoNumber of BGP/OSPF/EIGRP session per L3 fabric are 3000.\n https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/5x/verified-scalability/cisco-aci-verified-scalability-guide-521.html\n 5.2 Jumps to 10000.\n We asked Cisco and the answer was kind enough to say \"Yeah, the huge jump to 10000 is because, we tested with 10000, and we just tested 5.2 more than 4.2\".\n This doesn't necessarily gives us the answer we were hoping for. Basically, we would like to know if someone faced this amount of configured BGP connections and went beyond the \"limit\".

          "description": "I'm working on an RFP to re-fiber my org's main building. We are hub and spoke, with the datacenter in the basement and four closets, one on each of three upper floors with the fourth in an wing off the 1st floor. \n Previous guy put in multimode fiber to all the IDFs, and it's only OM1. That was over 20 years ago. I'm pushing gigabit over it without issue, but want to go to 10g this year and work towards 25g in the near future, with 100g in the next ten years. So I'm planning to bring in contractors for a rip and replace, out with the multi and in with single mode.\n Question is, how many strands? I know could push 100s of gigs over a single strand, but that is $$$$$ carrier grade stuff... I'm looking for something more in the practical range, so that is duplex LC, or MPO/MTP, for speeds of 25g to 100g based on the Aruba equipment I have right now. \n Looking at material cost, there's not a big difference between 6 and 12 strands armored plenum rated OS1. This is a fairly small job, short runs (longest is 400 meters). So labor is going to be more expensive than materials by my estimate. Looking at bulk cabling, I also see pre-terminated MPO/MTP 12 strand cable. Paired with fiber tray cassettes that accept MPO and break out into six duplex LC connectors, it seems to make sense for a degree of future proofing. I can use the LC breakout in the short term, and the higher density MPO connection is there for the future. The cassette system also seems nice, I can change the breakout if needed, without having to splice anything new.\n What would the downside of 12 strand be over 6 strand? Is there a downside to MPO vs LC terminations on the cable itself. Is there a downside to a breakout cassette versus spliced terminations?\n    submitted by    /u/gordonthree  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is the the general idea:\n from:\n Provider fiber -> Media converter -> Router -> Switch (access port) -> Firewall cluster vlan interface (via trunk port from switch) \n to:\n Provider fiber -> Media converter -> Switch (access port) -> Firewall cluster vlan interface (via trunk port from switch) \n Now when I plug the media converter port to my access port, STP reports port BROKEN for \"Shr *TYPE_Inc\" so it doesn't work. My understanding is that the other end is trunking and im doing access port so it's expected behavior. \n Now can someone confirm if I'm understanding this correctly and why this is working fine when connected to a router port? Also works if I skip the switch and plug directly into the port of one of the firewalls in the cluster (probably same reason why it works on router port).\n Switch port config:\n interface GigabitEthernet1/0/18 description 160-VLAN switchport access vlan 160 switchport mode access speed 100 end \n Router port config:\n interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 description WAN ip address x.x.x.x 255.255.255.248 ip nat outside speed 100 no negotiation auto \n What throws me off it when the media converter is plugged to my switch, the other end (what I see as gtw) can ping my firewall interface correctly but I can't ping them (again, that gtw). \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Casgrain  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "About 5 years ago I set up a small network for a restaurant in the Caribbean. They wanted some IP cameras, a POS system and a slot machine server installed. I used an inexpensive Netgear router, an unmanaged POE switch and an LTE box for internet. All cabling was Cat 5e. A year later they wanted to add a guest network for the adjacent hotel. I set this up, but used a completely separate network infrastructure. I used ubiquity APs due to budget constraints. My thought at the time was by separating the two networks, it would keep the business network bandwidth more secure and wouldn’t bog down the cameras with the guest network traffic. \n Currently the business is expanding, adding several more buildings to the property, creating a campus like environment. They want Internet and cameras on all these new buildings. Since I have these two separate networks, I’m starting to realize that it’s going to be much more expensive and redundant putting two sets of switches for every building. Also a couple of the buildings are across a road with very rocky soil. Max distance between buildings is about 110 feet. I want to know the best way to proceed with this project. I have a few questions:\n 1) How are networks designed for say college campuses or hotels with several buildings when it comes to critical networks and simple Wi-Fi? Do they separate things?\n 2) Is there any reason to keep the two networks separate in my case.\n 3) What is the best way to segregate the network traffic, forming a more secure, prioritized network for the POS and camera, and a less secure network for guest WIFI?\n 4) I want to use fiber to span the buildings, but If I am forced to use PTP wireless bridges (due to very rocky soil), can I use one PTP bridge to support 2 vlans?\n Thank you in advance for your help. As I am still a novice at this, problems like this are a great way to learn about this industry.\n    submitted by    /u/Stevogangstar  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys, we are moving to Extreme and going to be taking advantage of their fabric tech for our new multi campus network. We are coming from a stable and reasonably complicated network with IP routing to the access layer and separate VLANs and subnets on every switch for distinct devices types. \n We are looking at ways we can build upon our existing design and stability but take advantage of features that fabric that mean we can change the design to suit each system. One thing that interests me is the possibility to move back to having L2 segments spanned across the entire estate and assigning a /24 subnet for a particular system such as CCTV. We can then give the service owner the /24 and tell them wherever they install their devices they will sit on the same subnet and if the system doesn't work they can't complain about devices not working over L3 when communicating with each other etc. \n One of the problems with this approach is deciding where to put the gateways, what to push to the firewall or to keep on the core. We were looking at pushing critical devices gateway to our firewall for most control but also I am wondering about VRFs/segments and controlling traffic with routing rather than just spanning L2 to our firewall?\n Any advice or tips appreciated on how to best take advantage of fabric without making a mess.

          "description": "I'm the network engineer at an organisation with around 130 branch sites spread across New Zealand and overall around 4000 users.\n We have Meraki SD-WAN, switching and wireless at the moment. We are backhauling all traffic from branch sites back to a Meraki VPN concentrator in our DC and breaking out to the internet via Fortigate firewalls. We are in the process of migrating most of our on-premises server infrastructure and services to public cloud and eventually there may not be a need for an on-prem DC firewall.\n I've been tasked with coming up with a plan to locally breakout traffic at branch sites. Personally, the UTM/NGFW capabilities on the Meraki's are rubbish and nowhere near Enterprise grade compared to what we have with Fortigates. The logging and overall visibility is extremely limited compared to FortiAnalyzer as well.\n I've started looking into SASE solutions. The easiest to integrate with our existing Meraki kit is Cisco Umbrella. However, Cisco does not have an Umbrella PoP here in New Zealand so I would be forced to tunnel all traffic to Australia (Sydney or Melbourne) which is a dealbreaker. From past experiences and aside from concerns with reliability, this would not work for us with websites getting geo IP redirected to Australian sites, sensitive sites such as banking, etc.\n I'm interested to know your experiences with any of the below which I've identified as having a local PoP here in New Zealand.\n Zscaler\n Palo Alto Prisma\n Cloudflare\n Cato Networks\n Netskope\n It's a bit hard as you can imagine to read past the marketing fluff and gimmicks to know how these products truly perform.\n    submitted by    /u/jaf348  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone, \n My mother is opening a restaurant and needs some help with setting up a network for the business. I'm an IT professional with a focus on Azure/AWS security & compliance. While I have some networking experience in my homelab, I'm seeking some guidance because of some key constraints that I have to navigate.\n Here are the requirements:\n  \nOne subnet for a POS system called Toast. This subnet is highly managed by the vendor. No \"unauthorized devices\" can be connected to this subnet. The vendor provides a Meraki Z3 router and an unmanaged switch. Downstream from those, there'll be two receipt printers, three POS kiosks, and a cash drawer. Endpoints on this subnet will be hardwired. No wireless.\n One subnet for all non-POS equipment. For this, I'm planning on purchasing a Meraki Go Router Firewall and a Meraki Go Access Point. Endpoints on this network will all be wireless. No hardwired. \n  \nWe'll have five static IP addresses available. The kicker is that Toast POS explicitly forbids the presence of an intermediate device between the ISP's gateway and their router. Normally, I'd put a router firewall in front of the Toast POS router and isolate it on its own VLAN. Since I can't do that, I'm not quite sure how to create two subnets while meeting the POS requirements. Is it possible to connect both routers directly to the gateway, assign a static IP to each, and isolate the traffic on the gateway? I suppose that will depend on the capabilities of the gateway device. Comcast hasn't told me what unit we'll be getting yet. \n Just looking for some guidance here.

All PCs within their own boundary should be able to talk to the other PCs within that boundary only (with the exception of above)\n  \nI can not modify the IP addresses already assigned (everything is on a 192.168.1.0/24). I can change the gateways.\n \nI can not modify the switch attached to 1.50 and 1.75, assume its an out-of-box L2 switch\n \n I'd like to use ACLs to complete this by controlling the outgoing traffic from each layer 3 switch. (i.e Fa0/4 with an out ACL to stop PC5 from reaching outside its boundary).\n To my understanding one (of many) would look like (middle switch):\n interface FastEthernet0/10\n ip access-group TO_NORTH out\n !\n ...\n ip access-list extended TO_NORTH\n permit ip host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.1.50\n permit ip host 192.168.1.1 host 192.168.1.50\n !\n I recognize there's an implicit deny at the bottom, that should cover anything not listed from \"leaving\" the \"boundary\". After I apply this ACL to the port, for some reason all traffic no matter the source or destination still passes through that switch, port, and ACL as if it was never applied.\n ​\n I think i've dug my mind into a rabbit's hole and have confused myself over what I believe should be rather easy.

These webhooks will make basic changes via Ansible, like update a port description or change a port's mode based on updates to interfaces. However, there have been times where I've tried to update 10+ interfaces at a time, which will then cause the webhook handler to take on 10 webhooks/execute 10 scripts at the same time. This seems to spike CPU usage for varying amounts of time, depending on the number of interfaces I attempted to update. The spike causes the VM console to freeze up and often causes some of the webhooks to not execute properly.\n I'm just curious if anyone else is using their NetBox server as a webhook handler, and if so, what specs it's deployed with to get it to work smoothly.

I literally just want this to act as a router between the company firewall and our domain controller but I can’t for the life of me get it sorted.

Each of the buildings also has its own wan switches and wan routers.\n We back up EVERYTHING at our Primary DC which is located in our head office and to a DR site in a collocated data center about 3 miles away, we back up at least once a day (some systems backup hourly) using Veeam.\n We have a contingency plan for servers and systems if something kills primary sites. Realistically unless there's a power failure or some kind of apocalyptic event. Think worst-case, think the building Data Centre has been fired and both redundant cores are down.\n For the sake of discussion, let's assume you still have your off-site backups and application in the DR site, and both redundant core switch fails at the primary site. In that case, Servers and workstations lose connectivity to the network.\n How would you route end users to connect to the DR site?\n Has anyone actually dealt with such a scenario; how did it go? If not, what plan do you have or what is the suggestion?\n    submitted by    /u/DENY_ANYANY  \n [link]   [comments]",

Have a Watchguard Router and Unifi AP's/Switches.\n Ran into an issue last week where our 16-XG died. Would keep shutting off randomly. Couldn't find one available immediately, so had to reroute the cables to a different switch on the rack while we found a replacement.\n Got a USW-Pro-Aggregation to replace it.\n Switched everything to the new one, thought we were all in the clear.\n Started getting emails around 11/11:15 at night that VPN/network was down. Reboot the Watchguard and everything is back up and running. Get the same messages in the morning around 6:30/7 pm. Watchguard reboot fixes it again.\n More of the same all week, thought I might've plugged a cable in wrong somewhere, and that was causing issues. Gone over all of them, and everything looks to be fine. Thought maybe our backups were causing the issue, since they run at around 11pm at night, kinda made sense.\n Turned off Backups last night, same thing happened.\n Turned them back on tonight, and same thing happened.\n In the Unifi Console, the amount of clients on certain switches doubles. The switches at times show a Down speed of 79641 Mbps, but average 300-1000Mbps. Clients also show a huge download. But on the PC's I can't see anything being downloaded. Looks like there's a ton of traffic from the backups using Wireshark. But my knowledge of Wireshark is very limited.\n The only way to get things going again is by rebooting the Watchguard, or one of the network switches.\n Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/PM_ME_HOT_RAMEN  \n [link]   [comments]",

It'll only be for IoT devices that's related to the dc operational needs, like cctv, electrical or temp sensor, etc. There will be 5 floors, and approximately around 17 thousands of ip or endpoints will be used.\n So i'm considering using vxlan for the sake of IP efficiency and broadcast storm prevention, since there'll be 5 floor and the switches will be put everywhere.\n Is there a best way to do the segmentation?

If I use dedicated / different vlan for each floor (by floor vlan segmentation), i can't see the benefit of the vxlan is utilized.

Even telnet to ports do not return anything (which seemed like an indicator of a firewall in between)\n - However, there are no firewalls or access lists in between my Macbook and the destinations - I confirm this since this is the network that I manage and own, and there have been no anomalies detected. No routing configuration changed.\n - I can ping/traceroute using ICMP to the hosts\n - Another colleague's Macbook, in the same source as 10.0.1.0/24 can connect to mentioned host without problems\n - I have done tcpdump with the following commands, which return no packets if the traffic belongs to one of the affected flow (say the host I'm trying to connect to is 192.168.13.13)\n sudo tcpdump -nnvv host 192.168.13.13 0 packets captured 0 packets received by filter 0 packets dropped by kernel \n - For a certain Window DNS server in 192.168.13.0/24, I can use it to resolve the DNS queries (via dig). I cannot, however, connect to it via RDP (while I was able to just one week ago). Tcpdump displayed DNS requests/responses, ICMP requests/replies, but no RDP traffic even coming out of the Macbook\n ​\n This has recently happened.

For example, google Remote Desktop seems cannot be recognised with 4.5.0 along with many others that are listed. In the old days anything with application awareness needed to be updated fairly regularly to stay up to date with application signatures. Is this a reason to run a pretty current software release? Not sure how good VMware SD-Wan is at application awareness but would have thought pretty good ? \n Cheers\n Juan\n    submitted by    /u/Material_Ad_3743  \n [link]   [comments]",

These modems have generic 4G SIM cards in them. The IOT devices use this public 4G connectivity to push data to an FTP server unsecurely. CTO wants to change this. CTO wants to put the FTP server behind a private subnetwork, and he wants to have the 4G SIM modems connect to a VPN with a peering to the private subnetwork with the aforementioned FTP server.\n Here's the thing: I'm not sure how this works. The usage of 4G SIM cards means that the IP address is dynamic or keeps changing. Furthermore, the modem only supports some old L2TP/IPSEC protocol. As the CTO wants this to be on Azure, I've read about Azure Site-to-Site and Point-to-Site, but I don't know how to relate this back to these modems.\n Does anyone know how this is accomplished?\n The traffic goes from public 4G to VPN Client to Azure VPN Gateway subnet to private network with the FTP server.\n    submitted by    /u/janeohmy  \n [link]   [comments]",

We used all SMOF components (standardising on SMOF in the DC) consisting of: 24F Type A Cassette <> 24F Type A trunk cable <> 24F Type AF Cassette. This works and allows standard A-B patch cables on either end when patching. Essentially Port 1 maps to Port 2 on the remote cassette (rolling the fibre). However, there was a bit of confusion during installation as each A cassette had to match with an AF.\n  \nI understand polarity with the 3 solutions for MTP-12 (Method A, B, C). Are these exactly the same for MTP-24? \n Could we have achieved the same result using 2x 24F Type A cassettes, and a 24F Type C trunk cable in between? \n What are others doing for inter-rack patching in the DC - sticking with straight-through 1-1 polarity (A/A/A solution) and using A-A patch cables on one end, or using the inter-rack MTP to roll the fibre (either with a A/A/AF or A/C/A solution)?\n  \nI'm also looking to break out some 400G and 100G ports to 4x100G and 4x10G respectively.\n My understanding is I would use a QDD-4X100G-LR-S or QSFP-4X10G-LR-S connecting to a 3 x 8F MTP cassette (each cassette could break out 3 ports from the switch) using a MTP-12 Type A trunk cable.

          "description": "I'm running a VxLAN EVPN fabric with Cisco NX-OS 9.3(11), which has a DCI to a legacy DC (DC1) I'm migrating away from. The DCI setup uses EVPN multisite for the border-gateways in the new DC (DC2) and vanilla vPC VTEPs in DC1. I'm transitioning from a classic setup in DC1 with VRRP on the SVIs, to distributed anycast-gateway in DC2. The plan was to stitch the vlans between DCs via the border-gateways, then per vlan when half the hosts are migrated shutdown the VRRP SVI and bring up the anycast-gateway SVI.\n I've realised that for vlans I've stitched across the DCI, I can't reach the anycast-gateway address from hosts in the legacy DC. The VTEPs in the new DC just don't advertise EVPN routes for those interfaces. I guess this makes sense conceptually, as the anycast-gateway is intended for hosts directly connected to the leaf. However I do need some hosts in the legacy DC to route via an SVI on the border-leafs in the new DC as part of the migration process.\n As a workaround I tried spinning up an SVI with VRRP on the border-leafs in DC2, which I thought would be a valid workaround which I could then transition to anycast-gateway once the vlan was emptied from DC1. But the SVI is suspended as soon as I remove fabric forwarding mode anycast-gateway from the SVI config.\n Is this a known behaviour in VxLAN EVPN with anycast-gateway, that you can't combine a FHRP and anycast-gateway on the same leaf? Or perhaps a specific limitation with Cisco NX-OS?\n I was hoping to avoid having to extend all of the L3VPN constructs to the vPC VTEPs in DC1 as this is a manually managed DC (new DC is operated with Apstra) and this would increase the complexity.\n    submitted by    /u/Notworker  \n [link]   [comments]",

This technology allows for bandwidth bonding, seamless failover, and intelligent load balancing across different types of internet connections, such as DSL, cable, fiber, and cellular.\n I had the opportunity to choose a Peplink Balance router for multi WAN support, load balancing and failover solution, which I liked a lot, but at that time I realised that it holds a very small market niche, and it is not very popular. Peplink might not have the same level of brand recognition as some of the more prominent players in the networking industry. This could be due to a combination of factors, including limited marketing efforts, a smaller advertising budget, or the company's focus on niche markets. Consequently, many potential customers might not be aware of Peplink and its offerings.\n What's your experience with Peplink, if any?\n    submitted by    /u/_ReeX_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've recommended managed switches for these locations as many of them are automated sites with no personnel. I'm getting pushback on 2 issues. Our security consultant is recommending we put in unmanaged switches. They are cheaper, they can't be compromised from the Internet (cue scary music) and if a redundant link goes out you just ship out another cheap switch. Secondly, if we did go with the managed switch option, he is insisting that the OOB mgmt port doesn't plug into our trusted network but instead goes through the firewall.

The projector is assigned a static IP address, which allows the laptop to connect to it over the router. However, something is causing a huge amount of lag in the connection. The router appears to be working fine for all other devices, however for the projector connection there is tremendous lag at times. My solution for this was to purchase a wireless access point. So now I am trying to connect the projector to the network through the access point (with a different ssid) while the laptop remains on the main ssid. In this configuration the laptop cannot find the projector. The projector successfully connects to the network with its static IP, however on the laptop side it can’t be found.

So, to add a port to, say VLAN 10, as untagged it would look like this:\n switch(config)# vlan 10 untagged ethernet 16 \n The problem is, it seems that I can only either allow no access to the \"vlan\" command tree or allow all. I say that because I do not know and have not been able to find a way to tell TACACS to allow the user access to the list of VLANs (since they are user defined) or the port number. I've tried using an asterisk after the \"vlan\" entry like so:\n vlan * untagged ethernet * \n And other variations of this, but nothing has seemed to work.

That would probably prepare me for the SD-WAN part, because although I have some experience with it, but to learn how to set it up from 0 it totally different from just operating it and making some changes to it.\n Unfortunately at my company we don't have any clients, that would use Cisco SD Access, so I'm also looking for a place, where I can at least do some labs with the Cisco DNA Center. Also a bit more some BGP and MPLS practice wouldn't hurt, but I think that can be simulated by GNS3 or some other network sim.\n Do you have any preffered courses? What did help you to earn CCIE (or how are you preparing for CCIE)?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/dominikremes  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hoping you all can help get me on the right path.\n Setup: all 1G managed switches, Some connected by copper some by fiber/SFPs. Low low client count (under 100). There’s also a cable company provided gateway/router which spits out 192.168.0.x DHCP addresses internally. They also pay for two static IPs 10.x.x.x that currently go to some standalone ubiquiti server that routes them and handles the wifi internet access point traffic currently. The idea is to retire all that soonish. Keep if we must.\n All i wanted to do was set up this new network of switches i mentioned above on its own subnet (192.168.2.x) and everything on that subnet would be static IPs - and connect it at one place on ine switch with (i had assumed) A static route so anything not .2.x would get pushed to the cable company gateway/router and to the outside world. The .2.x subnet is for a POE camera system for them so thats why i was thinking keep it separate.. flawed? There’s also wifi 6 access points they want to add later for internet connectivity, and retire the old ubiquiti setup.\n Is this the right idea? Or should i swap over everything to be on the .0.x subnet? Should i leave everything on DHCP?\n Thanks..\n    submitted by    /u/jct111  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, the server load and the network load are very low almost nothing.\n We were start tune the network and the Kernel of the host as AMD/Intel recommended to see how it goes. Started using Vhost and multi-queues but now we are seeing a heavy load on the CPU from the Vhost/network which is higher than 70% of the CPU time with only a small number of VM's on these servers. Around 60VM's with low usage on CPU and 500Mbit (110k pps) on the network. The two Epyc 7h12 with 256 logical cores are pushing around 80 percent of the CPU and more than 60 percent of it is from the network/vhost. Now we don't have packet drops but under a heavy CPU load.\n Here are the configurations and changes we made.\n We have started with this 3 months ago\n -netdev tap,id=nic0,ifname=$TAPIF,script=no,downscript=no,vhost=on,queues=8 \\\n -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=nic0,mq=on,vectors=10,mac=$MAC \n Still had packet loss.\n Latest config.

          "description": "At the moment we are looking for an improvement in our data centers. We have two separated DCs that have redundant layer 2 dark fiber connections (not in use). In both datacenters are collapsed core topologies which are then connected to the campus core. The datacenter Vlans are routed from the respective collapsed core, i.e. the SVIs are located on the core VPC pair. The VPC peers share the gateway IP using HSRP.\n Since we want to connect both datacenters with layer 2 and the vlans should be available in both datacenters to move VMs back and forth comfortably, the question is how to solve this in the smartest way. My extensive internet research, unfortunately, has not brought a perfect solution. In addition, the documentation is often outdated (OTV/DCI etc.).\n One often mentioned possibility is to have 2 gateways in the DCs with two HSRP groups, but this does not seem to be a suitable solution. I was thinking of pulling another layer into the topology, so that the collapsed core layer becomes the aggregation layer. Above then comes a real core layer with all SVIs and again HSRP gateway. One VPC peer of the core layer would then be in the first DC and the other VPC peer in the second DC.\n Does anyone have an idea or a suggestion or is there no getting around VXLAN for such concepts nowadays ?\n    submitted by    /u/lolaoosljslolul  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’d consider myself to have intermediate network knowledge and I need some advice. …\n Currently I purchase 2 static IPs from my business internet provider. I use one for my public router, the other is for the company’s Fortigate which tunnels to corporate. The setup has worked well, but I’m slightly limited. \n Since I’ve converted to VoIP, our non business class routers don’t do a good job handling traffic for 10 phones, even with QoS on and SIP disabled. \n Currently, I’ve migrated the phones to behind the WAN. The Fortigate handles them much better, but I’m limited. There are blocked ports, some of which affect phone provisioning. The Fortigate is corporately controlled. I’m able to access the UI, but it’s connected to FortiManager for its config. Making any changes that large would throw a big red flag. \n Should I keep the two statics, or should I save money and migrate to a single DHCP? If so, what can I put behind the modem to manage traffic (on the cheap!). Can I provision a managed switch to handle the ISP, QoS for the phones, and separate the traffic for the Fortigate? Do I have to buy something expensive like a Ubiquiti VLAN capable device? I’m open to any ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/sinklayre  \n [link]   [comments]",

The ISP advertises several routes to us including a default route and a route to one of our remote branches among DCs.\n We also receive a route to our remote DC from another OSPF instance (OSPF 10) with our internal routers. This is redistributed into OSPF by the neighbor route as an E1 route.\n At present, the route to the remote DC that is making it into the routing table is the one from the ISP (OSPF 20), while we want the traffic to route internally via OSPF 10.\n I've tried a few ways to fix this but can't seem to crack it. I though using a route-map against a distribution list on the ISP OSPF instance to set the metric higher would work if I matched the route I was interested in, but it seems to filter out all routes from the ISP EXCEPT the one I want to affect.\n I feel like I'm missing something crazy obvious here, any chance one of you geniuses can help me out?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/paraffintrippin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Networkers of reddit,\n This issue first came up with a client that couldn't process their CC transactions after coming back from lunch. Essentially they could not resolve xyz domain and further examination revealed other domains also not being able to be resolved but 95% of domains on the internet are being resolved.\n Ive pegged it down to the Fortigate(s) simply because if we Ethernet into the back of Comcast modem DNS resolves to these specific domains. Alright so then I remembered our own business uses Comcast business and also has a Fortigate 61E and I can reproduce the problem on our network. I even noticed now I cant even hit the slickdeals website to which I was just checking it out last week on my machine. OK so I if i know the IP and setup a forward zone on the DC to the IP for the domain it routes and comes up. If i setup my machines DNS to googles/openDNS/comcast DNS it still will not resolve. If i nslookup using another DNS server besides the domain controller it will not resolve. I feel this eliminates the windows DNS DC(s). Packet captures show the DNS requests going to the DC out so I dont understand why the requests are timing out. I can double check the WAN packet capture but why would it fwd DNS request for certain domains and not others?\n No changes have been made to the Fortigates OS 7.x on any of these separate sites and neither have any web filtering rules other than blocking foreign countries inbound. There are no external connector feeds to 2 of the sites and ive disabled them on our site. I can replicate this problem across 3 different places across the city the only correlation being they are all on comcast business using fortigates across multiple workstations. Software upgrades on the fortigates are manual so I can only think of something being bugged, exploited or i need other ideas.

I know how to configure MLAG in the Arista using Port Channel and MLAG configuration. To do so, I select the interface, for example, interface ethernet 2, under that interface, then I create the “channel-group 20“ with the number and mode. Then I move to the interface “port-channel 20”, and associate that port channel with the mlag number (let’s say 20 as well). I'll do the same on the second switch so both switches know they are part of an LACP/Port-Channel with MLAG connection in case switch one goes down. \n Just need to know how I would configure MEC on the Cisco C9500 in a Stackwise Virtual mode.\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/fmaster007  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mostly phasing out older stuff, helping out our SD teams and working on incidents that occurred. Also we're occasionally involved with on-boarding new clients, fitting their needs. And other projects (think: new PoPs etc).\n Honestly, it kinda feels 'stale'. I like to play new shiny stuff once in a while. play around with it, see if it fits our use. For example software/tooling for QoL, other hardware, else. \n Reflecting on other engineering teams in other branches e.g. motorsports; they have engineers with a clear goal: win a race within certain rules. I don't think we (as NWE's) always have these clear rules. There is -however- one clear goal: it has to work. It mostly does not matter how (no clear rules).\n How would one create some kind of 'race' to squeeze every bit from a router. Having no jitter, or making sure you lose no packets in transit?

All 3 other switches' interfaces aren't working. All commands show the stack is functioning as normal however...\n 'show switch' shows all switches are a part of the stack no problem.\n ' show switch stack-ports' shows all is good with the stack cables\n Nothing in the logs is showing anything out of the ordinary, except for %SPI_FC-3-HIGH_WMARK_REACHED: Number of messages in the queue for channel 11 has reached maximum. Which i'm reading is a known bug on this code... shouldn't be an issue with stacking.\n We're able to reload all other switches individually with 'reload slot x' command, and reloading all other switches (except for the primary, because we dont want to reload the working one during business hours) didn't seems to fix it. After reloading the other member switches, they join back into the stack just fine. \n ​\n The member switches' ports are simply just not coming up. It's showing no link activity like there's no cable even plugged in. Tried bouncing the ports, and unplugging/replugging in cables, no luck.\n ​\n Has anyone ever ran into this? The plan is to reboot the whole stack tonight after work hours to see if that fixes, which i'm hoping it does. It has an uptime of 2 years also.\n Any advice would be appreciated!!\n EDIT:: The reboot fixed it! Of course next step is to get them upgraded.

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n We've had Cisco routers on order for over a year now and their ETA keeps getting pushed further out. I am wondering how prevalent different virtual router products such as VyOS, TNSR, or even CSR1K/CSR8K are in the enterprise non cloud environment for replacing traditional ethernet routers used for internet edge and private WAN connectivity. I understand there are some (very) large and small businesses that make use of them, but would like to understand how \"ready\" are they to replace traditional hardware-based internet/WAN routers? Most discussions around VyOS tend to be around home use rather than enterprise and VyOS/TNSR seem to be only occasionally mentioned in enterprise networking related discussions.\n Also, does anyone have experience with technical support for either? VyOS looks to be < $20K per year for unlimited installs and 1-4Hr support SLA. I feel I'd have a better time convincing management to try a products other than Cisco if they can be assured that they have decent support. There also aren't many concrete performance numbers published for VyOS but anecdotal evidence suggests that 10Gbps+ should be achievable even when hosted on ESXi. Are there any \"gotchas\" to look forward to with hosting any of these on ESXi as far as functionality, stability, and performance?\n Thank you all for taking the time to read this.\n    submitted by    /u/the_mastermind0  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is the best way to take a golden config and push out something that ensures all other switches have exactly the same config as the golden switch?\n We have Cisco Prime, not sure if that has a feature to do this. But I am also somewhat comfortable with python and ansible. I know with ansible, I have done ansible diff to find differences, just not sure how to go about enforcing changes based off that.\n Just trying to find an easier way than wiping all the switches and putting a new config on them.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/GC_Player  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am particularly interested in risk management (not security risk but potential impacts due to change).\n The ITIL framework is useful however there is an element that I struggle with, potential customers impacts, normally when defining potential, we might think as the worst case scenario, but even small simple changes could have big potential impact if we consider a typo when adding a new policy in an existing vrf, someone might say deleting or modifying policies are riskier, and I would normally agree, but when it comes to typos, missing a statement, wrong IP, community tag, etc, could have severe consequences.\n In my organization we have defined these categories to come with a number, the number will fall under ITIL thresholds, P1-P4, these are the categories:\n Potential Customer Impact, it is based on the activity being performed and the amount of customers potentially impacted.\n Type Element, it is a grouping that depends on type of element, for example, a core IP layer element would have higher value than a Voice or Data(Application layer) element.\n Service Area, based on the geographical area that the element is providing services, example, it could be region of a country, a state, it could be within a city.\n Service Density, amount of actual services that the element is supporting.\n As you can see, Type, Service Area and Service Density are based on the element where the work is going to be performed, but the Potential Customer Impact is based on the activity itself only.\n My struggle is finding a good balance in the risk management for the activity itself as there are many details like typos or missing small pieces of configuration that could create a big impact even though the activity itself could be a simple one. \n How does your organization manage risk from changes? What ideas can you share with me based on the above?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/muhepd  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yes, I know it means more data being sent, thus faster speeds, etc.. but when it comes down to it, QAM 1024 is sending 1024 different phases combinations in each transmission either on 20Mhz or 80Mhz, so what is 80Mhz doing behind the scenes with QAM that 20Mhz can't do? Is it sending more QAM 1024 transmissions?\n Thanks...\n Coding modulations are a way of sending more binary digits through each phase combined with transmitting more phase combinations …",
