          "description": "So as I'm reading this release/heads-up from MS about them turning on MFA as the security default in our/everyone's tenant in a couple of weeks, I'm a little concerned.\n I fully understand why they are doing it as a default - just the \"right\" security policy and takes (some) of the liability off of their plate. However, MFA will just simply not work for a lot of our staff. The bulk of our staff don't need multifactor to just open their email. Half of them can't even have their phones out at their desks due to client requirements nor do they have any ability to access email/system outside of the office itself.\n I'm by no means a \"system admin\" (more of a jack of all trades but master of none) but I'm the version of that in our office. I'm assuming that I can reverse this new default setting when MS flips the switch so we stay how we currently are set up - those that require remote access have MFA and those that do require remote access do not have MFA.\n Any help/direction you can provide will help settle my nerves. \n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/jpotrz  \n [link]   [comments]",

I figured I'd upgrade and found a fanless thin client, an HP T620, for cheap. I figured I could just set it in write mode, install the programs I needed, then disable write mode and have it get going. Only issue is that in write mode, it only exposes about 250mb of C: - not enough for OBS and storing music. \n I can't for the life of me find HP documentation on the T620 - everything seems to be a dead link. Is there any guide or documentation that people know of on how I can enable writes to the full 64gb storage capacity? Last time I did this, I was sysadminning a Citrix Xendesktop environment, and I used Citrix's console to create image versions as VHDs, cracked them open in Hyper-V, made my changes, and merged them in for the thin clients to boot to the image, but this is at drastically smaller scale and scope.\n    submitted by    /u/MohnJaddenPowers  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a Java-based utility designed to detect Command and Control (C2) servers using the Netlas API. The tool offers a simple and user-friendly CLI interface for searching C2 servers, leveraging the Netlas API to gather data and process it locally.\n ![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/Q0g0ego8SK97elJvTHN5IXLzs.svg)\n To get started, you'll need a Netlas API key, which you can obtain from the Netlas website. Once you have your API key, you can use the c2detect command to search for servers:\n bash c2detect -t <TARGET_DOMAIN> -p <TARGET_PORT> -s <API_KEY> [-v] \n This project is available on GitHub, and you can find the full README file with detailed usage instructions, Docker support, and a list of supported C2 servers there.\n If you'd like to contribute or have any feedback, please feel free to create a pull request or leave a comment. I hope you find this tool helpful in your sysadmin tasks!\n Happy hunting!\n    submitted by    /u/SuspiciousIsland2682  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The cheaper Vostro and Inspiron laptops always were a little shit, and would develop faults after a while, but the Latitude laptops were solid and unbreakable. These days, every model Dell makes seems to be a steaming pile of manure\n We were buying Vostro laptops during the shortages and we'd send so many back within a few months. Poor quality hinge connection on the lids, keyboard and trackpad issues, audio device failure (happened to at least 10 machines), camera failure, and so on. And even the ones that survived are slowly dying\n But the Latitude machines still seemed to be good. We'd never sent one back, and the only warranty claim we'd made was for a failed hard drive many years ago. Fast forward to today and I've now had to have two Latitude laptops repaired, one needed a motherboard replacement before I even had it deployed, and another was deployed for a week before the charger jack mysteriously stopped working\n Utterly useless and terrible quality\n    submitted by    /u/DeifniteProfessional  \n [link]   [comments]",

Up until now we have had a small IT department consisting of four techs who share all responsibilities, from help desk to equipment installs to device configurations to facilities work and vendor support.\n It has been increasingly difficult to manage projects and maintain our infrastructure due to how many hats we wear, the lack of staffing, and the constant interruptions of day to day issues. This has led to us experiencing a cyber attack and the loss of two of our staff due to burnout and the inability to keep up. \n The company has managed to bounce back, but I am not seeing any signs of slowing down and we are still meagerly staffed and I can sense another implosion on the horizon. \n But I’m getting too far ahead of myself. I guess my main question is - how do we structure our IT department as a growing company to assure we are staffed and handling issues correctly? I know we are going to need dedicated help desk staff, network technician, security officer, applications support, a manager, a sys admin, etc. - but what are the actual standards for a company from 300-500 employees? Is four IT staff enough? And what roles should they be divided into?\n I feel we are not organized and divided and staffed correctly, and since our current IT manager has zero IT knowledge, I want to see if I can gather some ideas to float up to higher management to get us the help we need before something major happens again due to lack of coverage/support and high burnout.\n    submitted by    /u/Rocklobster92  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, \n Tl;Dr what is your time management strategy?\n I'm a recent sysadmin supervisor after over a decade in service desk management plus a year as a sysad, and I'm struggling to juggle everything that needs to get done. I'm hoping to get some sage advice. \n I am working for a company that had a 3-man IT department two years ago but experienced rapid growth and are now up to 15 IT folks for 200 end users. There's a lot that needs to get done. We're taking this place from a ma and pa shop to an enterprise-level IT environment from the ground up, and need to do it quickly due to auditing requirements. \n I've been working 12+ hour days every day without a break other than rushing to the restroom, and it's still not enough. My calendar is booked in 15 minute increments for 2-3 weeks out at all times, with more being dropped on my lap every day. My two sysads are junior-level and struggle with most items, so I have to dedicate at least an hour every day to get them in a position to tackle their responsibilities.\n I average 6 meetings a day (my team, my boss, other IT departments, project managers, and vendors), plus project work, ticket escalations, emergency vulnerabilities, and any other random stuff that pops up. I'm stressed. My team is stressed. They keep threatening to quit and so I spend my lunch break every day helping them organize and prioritize and try to make sure they have everything they need. \n I started meeting every 2 weeks with the CTO and my boss to adjust priorities as needed, but it has only helped me to meet due dates rather than be chronically late. He says that they don't have the budget to hire another sysad right now. \n Finding another job isn't an option - I tried, and after applying to nearly 100 jobs I only received two offers for 20k less than I'm making now.\n Please help me. I'm at the end of my rope here. How do you do it? What's the secret?\n    submitted by    /u/octokit  \n [link]   [comments]",

We fall under the Finance dept, so the Finance Director (FD) is our boss, and fills the role of IT Director. He knows nothing about IT, and looks at every issue through \"cost-goggles\" ie. what is the cheapest option and go with that.\n He also doesn't trust either myself or the other IT guy when we tell him information about our systems and what they need. He's extremely micromanaging, to the point that if we change the way the weekly update email is worded, we need to have three meetings with him before we can make the change.\n This is turning more into a rant than a question, but what would you guys recommend we do? I'd love to go to the city manager and say that we need an actual IT Director, but he likely wont listen, and also tell the FD about it, which will make our lives hell. I also can't go to HR, because the HR dept also falls under the FD.\n Any advice is much appreciated, thanks for your time, and have a wonderful Thursday!\n    submitted by    /u/jeagerkinght  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some of them are manageable , as I absorbed handling the security training for our ~400 staff, all aging and in need of basic security knowledge. This alone seems like something worth compensating me for. There are more projects he wants me to do which feels like work i really need to be paid more to do. It requires coordinating with the vendors, purchasing software modules (so far we needed to spend like 12k on software modules for this project....), its expanding our systems capabilities, to me it is really a big project that I basically don't want to do.

This system was initially upgraded from an old SBS server which got obviously split into a DC and an Exchange Server. While this worked, it still got us stuck with some old domain scheme (I think it’s 2012 now), some old GPOs, settings and more. After a couple of years we’ve moved them to 365 using a hybrid solution for exchange and azure adconnect syncing the computers and users. \n We’re now planning on replacing the local physical servers as they’re pretty old and thought about taking the opportunity to replace the DC server with a fresh DC Windows Server 2023, and ditch the old exchange server (which is basically turned off for quite some time now, but not removed). This will finally give us a clean environment with a updated domain schema, no old exchange servers.\n ​\n My biggest concerns are:\n  \nKeeping the users, data and configurations on O365 and connect it to the new environment.\n \nConnecting the rest of the current servers to the new environment.\n \nWe’re also using Intune so would be nice to keep that working.\n \nKeeping the domain name on O365 and local DC.\n \nMaking the whole transition as smooth as possible.\n \n ​\n Would appreciate any tips and ideas on how to approach this project, I'm sure some of you had to go through something similar.

Company A and Company B both use Ivanti Avalanche for warehouse MDM). Our laptops and computers are currently managed on NAV (an absolute mess from what I've seen).

We can ask end users to leave their computers turned on, which allows us to BOMGAR in unattended, but per best practices, we have a GPO that locks their computer screen after 15 minutes of inactivity, so up 'til now, we've been asking the end user for their password so we can impersonate them. I hate that we do this as it seems janky AF.\n I know we could always sign in as ourselves on their PC and install the software, but unfortunately a lot of the software we've seen is poorly written and has to be installed as the user account that needs to use it.\n The obvious solution is to tell the company that we need to extend our helpdesk operating hours, or we need to have folks on call to handle this type of issue. The first is a non-starter due to $$, and the second is undesirable because who wants to be on call?\n I'm curious if anyone has come up with a better solution for scenarios like this?\n If Windows had some sort of built-in impersonation functionality that could be used to login as an end user (that was properly restricted and audited), that seems like it could be a solution, but I'm not aware of anything like that existing.\n Is this something a 3rd party login manager like Okta, etc. could help us with?\n    submitted by    /u/vrtigo1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I got asked by a colleague to present MS Entra to my bosses (small company doing consulting for IAM). I have five minutes and the company works mainly with OIM, so every listener understands IAM way better then I do. I dont like to talk about stuff that I dont understand fairly well, so I am seeking for a bit of help here to not talk rubbish.\n Im fairly new to IAM and only worked with Active Roles so far and a tiny bit on OIM synchronizing CSV-Files to the system. So my knowledge of OIM is pretty limited. Knowledge about Sailpoint is basically non existent. \n Last year MS launched Entra which includes AAD, a CIEM-Solution, Entra Verified ID and Workload Identities. As far as im aware \"MS Entra Identity Governance\" is also a new component. \n I would like to quickly go through the components and then focus on things Entra does way better or way worse than the the other to products.\n I would like to focus on the connection to other systems (especially On-Prem-Systems), since it looks like this could be a weakspot of MS Entra. Is there anything MS Entra (or Azure AD) cant do and why?\n Lifecycle-Management is also a topic I want to focus on. Looks to me like I am pretty limited to what MS offers out of the box. For example if I create a new Workflow for a Leaver I can put in a step, that a mail is sent to the employees manager, but not to the colleagues. \n Is there anything else MS does greatly or badly on this topic?\n I do greatly appreciate your help girls and guys, since I am really not sure about what to focus on and where the weaknesses of each application are. According to the websites they all can do everything and do everything best.\n    submitted by    /u/g0n87  \n [link]   [comments]",

The prep is already done, ISO extracted, batch file with all the params created. \n When I manually execute the batch file that basically says \n setup.exe /auto upgrade /DynamicUpdate disable /showoobe none /Telemetry disable\n it asks me for admin credentials and after entering them with 2 clicks it just does the upgrade. When I'm logged in as an admin it just shows the user access control window with Yes / No and does it. But that credential request shouldn't come up for regular users, obviously. \n When I execute this batch file from the deployment service however it just doesn't do anything. The deployment script runs forever and never logs what went wrong. Doesn't matter if I use a silent parameter or not. \n My guess is that the problem is in the context in which the file gets executed. And I have tried all the contexts I could think of. I assume I'm missing a vital part in the logic chain here that prevents me from seeing the solution. \n Further info: The setup.exe and files are hosted on a file share that can be read-accessed by anyone. The batch file is on the deployment repository and gets downloaded to the client PC when executing. \n And I've had a similar issue with a different software deployment tool already when I wanted to put a simple shortcut on the desktop of users on a PC as an admin.

          "description": "Good morning everyone.\n I hope I am not too annoying with my questions lately.\n I am having some problems with Azure Information Protection and the valid applications.\n From what I am reading, it seems to work together with data classification and data loss prevention.\n Which means, if a certain document could contain PII, It can detect this and recommend or apply a sensitivity label on that document, making sure whenever it might leave the company, that the data will be unusable for everyone outside of the company.\n It's a defense mechanism, which extrudes outwards, into the public world.\n I've seen examples, where they only use 3-5 Labels with encryption and/or watermarking. This makes total sense to me, as I have worked with PII before.\n My boss now heard this and thinks, that this will solve all of our problems.\n He told me to create 5 sensitivity labels, for each personnel group of our company. From the CEO to the normal employee. Everyone should get access to documents with a certain sensitivty label, but not others.\n From what he described, he wants a protection, which goes inwards. His example shows, that the he is very wary about his employees.\n No watermarking or data classification. Just encrypt everything and make sure, that no normal employee has access to sensitive documents from his team lead or above.\n This feels wrong to me. I haven't found any example, where Information Protection was used like this. And with that I have a thousand questions and possible outcomes in my mind, because I feel like that it won't stay at 5 labels. In the end I might have to create a label for every project.\n I've seen the quote, that Information Protection are permissions, which move with the documents. But I feel like that my example is a bit \"extreme\".\n Has anybody used this before like this? Is this a valid use for Information Protection or is there another solution?\n    submitted by    /u/Shibocat  \n [link]   [comments]",

I asked him, why he came to this conclusion when he didn‘t read the whitepaper and what tool he would choose. Answer: My laptop uses bitlocker, that‘s why i store everything in excel. I asked him what he would do if his devices getting compromised? As long as his device is powered on bitlocker doesn‘t help. Well, if i get compromised it‘s over anyway, a password manager wouldn‘t help. \n 2) he doesn‘t deactivate or remove the local admin account, because he‘s the only one who knows the password anyway.\n 3) he couldn‘t tell the difference between MB and GB/TB.\n 4) he has no clue about linux and has no employee who does and still manages linux machines.\n I needed to vent, cause i always was thinking i‘m still not good enough for a sole sysadmin role to get a job at another company (i did, but struggled long time to do this step) and did know more than a MSP boss with 100s of clients…\n    submitted by    /u/mans3n  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ended up with 2 job offers so far, but what really got me was the way the manager of one of the companies went about it. He went back to his boss and asked for 15% more than the top end of the posted salary range because \"We need this guy, and we need to be competitive in the market to get him\" (his exact words). I ended up taking a ~20% pay cut from where I was before the layoff, but I think I found a place that wants me. \n It was really nice to feel like the pretty girl at the dance for once.

My position was newly created. So 'we', really means 'boss'.\n Also, links to a place where I can read more about this subject is appreciated.\n ​\n We run about a 100 android tablets through MaaS360 and android enterprise. When we first started doing this, we used a single gmail account to set up all the devices. However when we got to about 30 devices or so, it started dropping devices. So we created a second account. Same problem, but it was around 20 devices this time. So on so forth, now we have several gmail accounts managing our devices. I cannot find anything online that indicates a limit. MaaS360 doesn't have a limit in our range I know. \n Now I did see that there is a limit to 10 devices per user in MaaS360. One possibility is that we would set up devices for different users, but my supervisor would set up test devices under her name. This would then cause registration issues for subsequent devices. This only sort of makes sense though, because I can't see her setting up 10+ devices for herself. I also think it was dropping other users devices, not her devices. \n I feel the need to include timeframe here as well, in case things changed.

I work in a company where I am responsible for procuring everything but laptops (phones, chargers, monitors, docking stations, printer maintenance services, VESA mounts, laptop bags, headsets, mice, and keyboards).\n To make things even more complicated, I have to categorize each item properly in SAP so management approves these purchases, attaching the 'price offer' which is often just a screenshot of a price on a website. After that, I have to 'goods movement' them into SAP, attaching the invoice or proof of work.\n This process is causing me a lot of trouble since finance is constantly telling me that the material group, G/L account, or cost center is incorrect, which forces me to recategorize or start the process over. Unfortunately, my colleague already quit due to the frustration, and my boss has not delivered on promised changes to the process. As a result, I'm left alone to handle this mess together with all the IT work.\n This situation is taking up hours of my time daily, and I'm struggling to find a solution. My boss insists that we have to perform these activities and prioritize them, likely because his IT Director reports directly under a Finance director. Procurement says we have to open the Purchase Requisitions, as they can't transform them into Purchase orders themselves due to conflict of interest and policy concerns (although I doubt the legitimacy of this claim).\n I didn't want to vent, but I'm genuinely seeking advice and input from the r/sysadmin community. If any of you have faced similar issues or have any tips, suggestions, or a plan to tackle this problem, please share your thoughts. I'm eager to find a way to streamline this process or at least make it more manageable.\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/chewb  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently we have completely changed the structure of their Sharepoint site, renamed several Libraries and changed A LOT of rights.\n The problem I am now facing, is that users that now lost their permissions to certain libraries or libraries that had their name changed/got removed, will still see the folders on their respective PC's. The folders are no longer synced, but they are still present on the systems including files. Every user may even face this on multiple pc's as they work on multiple systems (flex). As you know, this may differ for every user aswell, because they all have different rights.\n Question is, do you know any way to automatically remove libraries that are no longer synced?\n The systems are managed through Intune and are all Azure AD joined.

The pay is going to be more, the estate is probably 10x’s bigger than my current place, and it’s a spin off from a huge company. So it’s sorta like a startup in the way that the tech is all shiney and new. No legacy stuff at all. \n I love my current job. We are also shiney and new and since we are way smaller, I’m well known by everyone, even the C-Suite. They know the names of my wife and kids and always ask about them when they see me. I’m also respected and one of the leaders others seek out. \n The team is siloed into 5 parts at the new place and I will be leading one of the silos but will take part in the other areas. Today, I do all 5 parts and do them well. So I’ll be less focused on those other areas. Also my work load is insanely easy at my current place. I can work 60 hours one week and maybe 40 minutes other weeks. I can come and go as I please at my current place, my boss doesn’t care what I do. The people at my current place are also some of the smartest people I’ve got to work with. And I have known and worked with these people (holy shit this just occurred to me when I did the math) for MORE THAN HALF MY LIFE! \n I’m really torn here. Any thoughts from people who have been in this situation?\n Edit: A couple of the posts here answered the question. This post could tend to get a lot of responses so I’m going to stick with the current gig. I’ve been here since I was a teenager (buy outs, ipos, spin-offs). I haven’t had a real interview in 25 years so I’m going to get to the end of the interview process at this new place and kindly decline.

I have set up NPS policys for ethernet, using smartcard of other certificate and enrolled the certificate used so that it is visible on Computer1. Being a member of EAPTLS-group is a requirement. The CA is the same as the NPS server. \n GPO is set to:\n Autoenroll certificate and renew certs based on templates\n \"SmartCard or other certificate\" network auth method\n \"Computer Only\" auth mode\n Selected certificate issuer as well as trusted root CA's\n defined what server to connect to for NPS\n ​\n GPO is applied to:\n OU that Computer1 is placed in\n Authenticated users (also tried security filtering EAPTLS-group but that made no difference)\n ​\n To the issue:\n When trying to connect the NPS security logs say that for Computer1: \"The Network Access Permission setting in the dial-in properties of the user account in Active Directory is set to Deny access to the user. To change the Network Access Permission setting to either Allow access or Control access through NPS Network Policy, obtain the properties of the user account in Active Directory Users and Computers, click the Dial-in tab, and change Network Access Permission\" \n This is not true, as it is set to Control access through NPS \n Any ideas as to what might be happening?

Currently I run the IT systems years for a small finance company in London (35 people), and I've been there over 6 years now. While I like the variety, challenge and autonomy, things like professional development and training haven't been forthcoming which has left me with no recent professional qualifications.\n My CV currently only lists ITIL Foundation v3 as a professional certification, which is now woefully out of date, but I feel like at least ITIL hasn't changed that much. I have however, made the choice to omit all of MS certifcations from 10 years ago as it really doesn't look great to have things like Server 2008 and SQL 2012 listed given how dated they are now.\n So my question is this, given that my free time is limited like most people, which are the best certifications to get which are fairly short 1-2 day courses and fairly cheap, while also providing good prospects for future roles, and a good line to have on my CV and LinkedIn. Ideally in the realms of cyber security, change management and the Azure Cloud.\n My initial thoughts are\n Cyber Essentials\n ISO 27001\n MS Partner courses in the more advanced areas of Azure Load balancing and cloud server migration.\n Maybe looking into upgrading to ITIL v4\n Change management courses\n ​\n I would love some feedback and suggestions, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/The-Dire-Llama  \n [link]   [comments]",

We’re running M365 with exchange online. The freeze lasts roughly as long as the desktop notification then stops. We switched to M365 roughly 6 months ago, and this issue happened within the past 2 weeks. Now one thing thst happened was thst the feature preview caused the app bar at the bottom of the nav lane to move to the left side. That and us switching to FS Logix to replace roaming profiles are the only real changes that I know of. As far as troubleshooting goes I’ve disabled notifications for anything to show on desktop, rebuilt the local profile, rebuilt the outlook profile, disabled the updated apps bar, and no dice. I have not noticed this on the physical machine, only when removing via Citrix storefront to use RDP, or use the Citrix Desktop. We’re using on prem AD, Citrix VDA to support multiple users to one server, I’m one of the users effected. If anyone has any ideas or needs any clarification I am an open book ask me and I’ll answer.

We're filming it now and we'll have it on Netflix as soon as humanly possible. Again, thank you and sorry.\n Love is Blind is doing a live event. ~Apparently this is their first live event / episode.~ this is not the first live event.\n Servers are down, no one can connect. They communicated 15 minutes until online and now it's been 20.\n Oof.\n Update: 28 minutes in and still down\n Update 2: 43 minutes in, still down. The hosts posted an update on Instagram saying they're working on it still\n Update 3: 57 minutes in, still down. Maybe they have an internal go live at 6pm pst, one hour in?\n Update 4: 62 minutes in, still down. We're in this for the long haul. This is bad lmao especially since they have the cast there just awkwardly waiting until they can stream it live\n Update 5: 75 minutes in, still down. All influencers are now streaming from their Instagram accounts and it looks like chaos\n Update 6: POSSIBLE FIX: PLAY THE EPISODE 12 AND FAST FORWARD TO THE ENDING. THEN ITLL SAY NEXT EPISODE AND PLAY\n Update 7: Well, it played for about 2 minutes live and then crashed again\n I was able to get in after 86 minutes. Now I can't get in again. Some people are streaming it off their phone on TikTok and IG\n apparently Netflix canceled the live stream and they're just recording it to post later. Not sure how true this is but it seems it is, they're going ahead with the event. \n Back to just loading\n    submitted by    /u/hngfff  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is because these are Microsoft Store Apps that require updates.\n If you're in an air-gapped environment this proves difficult as everything points to GitHub, third party sites, or a license to get an Appx installer for offline networks. It's possible to update these apps but if your workplace is very hard set on risk avoidance instead of remediation you can remove these applications with PowerShell.\n You'll need to utilize the Remove-AppxPackage and Remove-ProvisionedAppxPackage Cmdlet to \"uninstall\" the Appx. \n Nessus showed vulnerabilities for these apps afterwards because the Windows app directory exist for the vulnerable Appx here: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps. You'll need to remove the Directory related to the removed Appx. I've only had luck removing these directories by running as SYSTEM via MECM.\n Something to note, if you remove the WindowsApps Appx Directory before running the PowerShell commands above you will not be able to remove the Appx with PowerShell.\n    submitted by    /u/TheSysAdminInMe  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been assigned to block that.\n In our environment, we are using ManageEngine Central, i thought of uaing that to implement this policy, but there was no such option. The optiones offered by GPO is to block specific application installation by either name of hash, i need it to be general for all portable apps.\n I have imported a full list of all applications installed in our environment, thought of creating a whitelist and prohibiting any other application, but no luck in that as well as im not sure which solution to use to enforce this scenario.\n The department is willing to purchase a solution and implement it to control such aspects, as security has a magnificent intrest of the management.

When I check Open Files on the file share I can see who has them open. Well, I asked the user if they could close out of the spreadsheet if they were done and they replied that they didn't even have it open. Sure enough there was no lock file in the directory either. If I kill the open file, then another user can open it but this problem repeats itself randomly.\n I'm starting to think it's a share permission or drive permission that's causing this but everything looks good... Is there a way to analyze permissions through directory trees (like see an overview of what the user has permissions to do starting from the root of the share) or is this something else entirely? I've googled like a madman and everything just says to remove lock files or close it from Open Files on the server itself.\n    submitted by    /u/R4LRetro  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything on the SubCA in PKIView shows OK and the AIA has the new root (3) file listed etc just fine.\n AIA Location #2 Unable to Download http://pki.domain.com/crl/name1(2).crt.crt) and it should be name1(3).crt.\n Both the old RootCA cert (2) and the new (3) exist at that path and I can see them when browsing to that location in a browser and both files will download fine.\n If I go into Manage AD Containers , the new renewed root ca cert shows up under Certificate Authorities Container tab as well as the AIA Container tab correctly. I cannot figure out why everything appears ok, but the file name is not updated in the pki path to the new cert name and it says unable to download.

But AppLocker works on any current cumulative update for Win11 and Win10 Pro, even if managed by group policy - it no longer requires Enterprise.\n So this is actually a massive improvement over needing to use SRPs, but Microsoft never really announced SRPs would stop being enforced so it's a security risk if you don't know to roll out AppLocker.\n The article on AppLocker being enabled for all editions is referring to some older updates but a lot of people are reporting it didn't start working until more recently. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5024351-removal-of-windows-edition-checks-for-applocker-e3a763c9-6a3e-4d9c-8623-0ffe69046470\n    submitted by    /u/PowerShellGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was a credit card stealer script embedded on the webserver. The script was caught by our antivirus software on a user PC they they went to buy something on this website. My user raised a ticket and I investigated. I knew nothing about this vendor of ours besides the domain. I queried the domain registrar for the owner email address and got the private registration proxy one. Armed with this information I fired a quick email to the following addresses about the security incident:\n  \nRegistrar proxy\n abuse@\n security@\n webmaster@\n hostmaster@\n support@ \n  \nThe IT team of the vendor resolved the issue and I got a thank you email from them.\n However, of all these, only the webmaster@ address worked, the rest bounced back. I have come across this more frequently as new generation of sysadmins xome onboard, they don't know about this.

Sounds kind of neat.\n But to make sure everyone experiences this, Outlook will also start ignoring your system's default web browser and opening links in Edge no matter what. Users whose default has always been Chrome, and whose bookmarks and saved passwords are all in Chrome, will be highly confused by a very similar-looking browser that has none of their stuff. They'll probably call the helpdesk screaming \"why did you delete all my stuff?!?!\"\n The user can change this in settings, but options being offered for admins to shut this off is lacking. Both options listed (the cloud policy service and group policy) explicitly apply only to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (not business).\n So, for SMBs there seems to be no way out besides manually touching each machine.

          "description": "Last week my employer (a large robotics company) hired an MSP to work as our help desk. We had a different MSP for 10 years but due to some contract negotiation differences, we could not come to an agreement. The new MSP needed Jump boxes in the environment to use as administration systems to work from. \n ​\n They requested 18 boxes 1 for each person. the box requested was a server 2016+ and local admin rights plus rights to have basic administration of DNS, DHCP, etc. We provided the boxes and the accounts. \n ​\n Today (yay Friday!) I happen to refresh my server manager and find a few new ADCS boxes. So I looked at all servers on the network to find what roles were installed. I found many jump boxes had ADCS, ADFS, ADDS, DHCP, DNS, and ADLDS. etc. Many even had LDS instances. \n ​\n I contacted the Helpdesk manager and asked why these servers have these roles installed when they are only meant for jump boxes and they didn't follow the documented change management process. \n He then proceeded to respond \"We needed these so we could administrate these services on the servers,\" I asked him why they didn't use RSAT because installing these roles leaves the environment up to more risks. He seemed surprised at the existence of RSAT. \n ​\n I am very frustrated that the MSP would install and configure critical roles on jump boxes in the environment but I am also Dumbfounded that the basic tools for administration seemed to be unknown to them and it makes me question their knowledge. They to me seem to be a huge risk at this point. \n ​\n Would it be a deal breaker for anyone here? Would you cancel the contract?\n    submitted by    /u/sh4d0w1021  \n [link]   [comments]",

My co-worker believes there will be less maintenance of the devices themselves such as constantly dealing with driver issues (Dell), plus they're much cheaper. \n Obviously we'd have to virtualize any app so it can be accessible through a browser, which only would be a couple or so, and we'd have to start managing the devices via MDM. We would keep Exchange Online and Azure for email and authentication. \n I'm trying my hardest to keep an open mind about this as I do not want to be a hinderance to new ideas, and this would fall mostly on me to make this transition happen, at least infrastructure wise.\n I would just like to know what any of y'all think of the idea of transitioning to Chromebook based laptops/tablets.\n    submitted by    /u/Civil_Complaint139  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve been running hyper V for over 15 years successfully and I don’t have any issues with it\n My question is, is, can you install hyper V in such a way that you don’t have the entire windows OS under it? That way all you’re running is hyper V on the bare metal with all of the VMs under it. (Dell Servers) \n It’s just something I’ve never researched or known if it’s possible \n To be honest, I’ve never installed the server OS without the GUI.\n I’m just really admitting my ignorance I’m just curious. To see if there’s a better way sometimes it seems like a waste to have the full OS just sitting there doing nothing when hyper V is doing 99% of the work on the post.\n    submitted by    /u/L0raxB0rax  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Morning! \n We recently installed a NUC11TNBV7 device in a room with a NEC monitor. To connect the device to the monitor we had to use a USB C to displayport cable. \n The NUC displays an image when first turned on, but if the monitor is power cycled, the image stays black, and eventually the monitor will go back to sleep since it's not receiving an image. \n I've updated the thunderbolt drivers, the bios, and the VGA drivers in the NUC but nothing seems to work. I've checked the power plan settings on the device as well as adjusting to maximum performance in the BIOS. \n Interesting enough, unlike the other nucs in the room, when you vnc into the device with the monitor off it shows the full 1920x1080 and a monitor connected, while the older nucs revert to 800x600 and no monitor connected. \n Due to the configuration of this room, using the HDMI out of the NUC is currently not an option. My next step will be to order an active HDMI to displayport cable. \n Our NUC10's have no issue using USB-C to DP. I'm Curious if anyone else has any experience with USB-C display out issues with these NUC11 and if you have a solution.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/34orks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope you have a better read only Friday than me ! \n One of our domain controller which is physical computer installed in a other site far away from my office, has no trust relation with our Active Directory, so it’s impossible for us to access it anymore. It happened after a “little” mistake was made. Basically this server is gonna be replaced and we need to clone it and redeploy it on a new VM in our hyperV cluster, for a specific software installed on it. So the clone was done, using disk2vhd cloning C: of that server, and mounted on a new VM, the new vm wasn’t connected with network until the IP was changed, but to change the name of that new VM, it was needed to downgrade the VM from DC to non DC, and to do this it had to be connected to the network, and it’s at that moment where we had the conflict, which made our physical machine loose the trust relationship and removed itself from our AD.\n Has anyone of you an idea on how to make the physical server re join our AD and being able to connect on it ? Beside going physically on site where the server is located which is a 6 hour drive from office. We can’t connect with any AD account because no trust relation, and no local account possible because it’s a domain controller.\n Sorry for my bad English, not my native language,\n    submitted by    /u/Femboy6372819  \n [link]   [comments]",

We've currently got a 16 channel Hikvision unit that (while being a major step up from our old java-based D-Link DVRs) is a pain in the butt with it's requirements for proprietary video plugins and management software that demands local admin rights.\n Fortunately, we have contractual obligations with some of our customers that prevent us purchasing any additional Hikvision equipment (NDAA concerns), so our need to upgrade to a 32 channel unit gives me the perfect excuse to ditch Hikvision and our current NVR.\n Does anyone have any recommendations for an NVR that works with modern web standards, can be fully managed without specialized software (or at the very least uses software that's not stuck with Windows 98 security practices) and has basic motion-triggered recording features?\n Also, we have a number of cameras we don't want to replace just yet, so ONVIF compatibility is a must-have (though I imagine that's fairly standard at this point).\n EDIT: I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised by all the software-based recommendations. On the one-hand, it makes sense that a pure software solution would offer the best features and widest camera compatibility.

Prior to mgirate any users, I tested with my own account and set a deny permission on the license.asmx file for my user for read and execute.\n After restarting Word, I did not see my AD RMS templates anymore, which is great because this is what I expected. But instead, it connected to Azure RMS and showed the \"Restricted Access\" and \"Unrestricted Access\" template, as well as previously configured Sensitivity Labels. I did not create a SRV record for redirection, therefore I'm also wondering why it did connect to Azure RMS.\n I reverted the permission change on the license.asmx file and included my user again to read the file. I can verify this by opening the URL in the browser. I also deleted the MSIP folder in %localdappdata% and removed everything from the registry, that points to <GUID.aadrm.com>. Office is still connecting everytime to Azure RMS instead of my internal AD RMS server. I have an existing SCP, but this seems to be ignored now and I cannot get it back working to use AD RMS.\n Any advise?\n    submitted by    /u/Proper-Gold-3664  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good morning\n I have been given the green light to implement cloud based printing in our business of around 300 users and 40 printers. I'm looking to go with Printer Logic as the print queue based licensing suits our needs better. \n I'm just curious to know from anyone that has rolled this out what your procedure was? Currently have 2 print servers, one for each site. I want to do some initial testing first with a couple of printers before rolling out across the business. \n We have around 10 GPOs relating to mapping printers for users (the guy before created a GPO for every different department instead of just using 1 GPO with item level targetting) Is it a matter of amending these GPOs to delete rather than create/update before pushing out the Printer Logic agent to the endpoints?\n Appreciate any advice\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/JuryAdventurous1097  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is a medium-sized company with about 30 employees.\n All employees work on a Windows Server 2019 terminal server and have a Microsoft 365 Business Basic license. Teams has the latest updates.\n At the beginning of the Corona Pandemic, the Teams-Free licenses were rolled out as a test. Everything has now been migrated to Microsoft 365 and the users have full licenses that also include the use of teams.\n Now the problem, which affects a part of the users, about a third: Teams ALWAYS logs in with the old \"Free\" account and does not recognize the assigned license. Logging out and back in manually doesn't help either. In the free account, an old database is listed up to the end of 2020, everything after that (since using the O365 licenses) seems to be in a kind of different profile that is not loaded.\n I have already reinstalled Teams, assigned / withdrawn the Teams Exploratory license from all users as a test and deleted the Teams cache under %appdata%/Microsoft/Teams.\n If the user logs into Teams via office.com, everything works as it should and the correct content and chats are displayed, the problem ONLY affects the local client.\n Do you have any idea? Some Teams-related things are just out of my understandings... Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Herberge  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Got another fun one!\n So imagine you have an on prem AD, contoso.local, that doesn't really do much outside of PC login auth but you're quite attached to it. Then imagine you also have M365 in parallel, as contoso.com and it is in use for keeping track of M365 licenses, which is no biggie, but also for auth for some third party services, which becomes a massive PITA if it breaks. \n Now picture a world where you want the two to work together. Now, if someone who gets paid a lot more than me hadn't gone in and just manually created accounts for everyone in 365 and had instead used aad connect it'd be pretty simple and my life would be easier. But that was not to be. I can't just do the needful, make a new upn suffix and have sync magically just work. \n Can I map existing on prem AD users to 365 users with aadsync? And the PCs too, I guess, although while they[re there they're not really there, y'know? Ultimately, we're wanting to keep a couple AD servers on prem because it is just so dang easy to use (especially as an auth provider for a lot of internal stuff) but because everyone else is using cloud then we are too.

I refused saying that was a tremendously bad idea of putting the company network at risk. I followed up saying we have plenty of spare laptops and I can issue him one in less than a few minutes, he dismissed this idea saying that this new IT stance was overreaching and controlling the business in ways he did not agree with.\n I've been in it for 22 years, I recognize that when I started a request like this would not have been given a second thought, however, with the way things are these days I only allow company managed computers to connect to our internal network. I've explained to the CFO that we have other consultants working for us who either have their own issued computers, or, are using cloud services to upload their work so that internal employees can review and save it as needed. His only argument for allowing a computer we do not manage to connect directly to our internal network is that it would be faster and more efficient for this consultant to do his work. My rebuttal is that while it is faster for him to do all of his work on a single computer it raises our risk by an incalculable amount that I do not think is worth considering.\n While I feel fairly secure in my response, and I have not relented one bit, his over the top response to this has me wondering what other professionals in the field feel about this situation.\n Thoughts?

My Dell E6410 worked reliably with a proprietary dock, but my Dell XPS 13 with a Thunderbolt dock had endless issues with detection. Even after multiple driver downloads and fresh Windows installs, problems persisted with sound and monitor detection.\n I then switched to an HP EliteBook X360 with a USB C dock, which worked well until I hit limitations with monitor resolution. I replaced that with a Startech Thunderbolt 3 dock, which generally worked fine but occasionally required unplugging and replugging after sleep mode.\n Now, with my Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 5, I use a ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 dock for Workstations. While I can remove my laptop from the dock without issue, returning it to the dock requires a hard reboot. And when the laptop goes to sleep, waking it up is often hit or miss, with only one screen coming up or no keyboard function.\n It's frustrating to deal with these issues, and I know I'm not alone - I constantly hear from my users with similar problems on their devices, including Microsoft Surface Laptops with both Surface Docks and universal docks. It's been over half a decade since USB C docks became the standard and there seems to be little improvement from manufacturers.

The typical infra for an app is two servers with redundancy (keepalived, HeartBeat...).\n This means one tool = at least 2 servers + some networking and one small team for maintenance (often 1-3 people). \n For the context, we don't do cloud providers (sensitive data) and we don't have to handle a lot of traffic load (internal tools only).\n When I arrived I suggested to \"centralize\" this as more and more apps were also shipped containerized. So with my team we set up a Kubernetes infra which work very well, and with few servers we are able to host like 10 internal tools.\n My points are : this brings same maintenance for all the apps (common k8s dashboard, procedures...), same backups and disaster recovery system, better security management etc. (I won't teach you all of this I think ^^) \n But the thing is : before all of this, there was very few service interruptions, and when it happened it had impact on one tools only. The k8s infra is simpler and more powerful, we had no interruption in one year. Last week, we had a stupid issue with a certificate in the CNI that interrupted all the cluster for one day (the k8s expert were not on site this day). \n This event created a bit of a debate about migrating legacy apps to k8s, am I still on the right path ?

Pool B has nothing moved onto it yet so I assume that's why it's reporting as virtually empty.\n I've read through the supporting documentation and followed to the letter with creating the disk group and volume. I haven't been able to find anyone else with this problem, which makes me think it's just the way it is, but seems odd.\n Has anyone come across this before?

I have never updated the BIOS or iDRAC firmware since I have had it, as I thought that they were probably close to latest possible version being as old as it is.

After some research I found a reddit post (I can't find it but if I do i'll link it here) about how they bricked theirs by not first updating to 1.65.66 and now iDRAC doesn't work anymore. I then stumble across another couple posts mentioning that there are at least 4-5 stepped firmware upgrades you must do in order but no one mentions them. I have searched through Dell's site for a couple days now and can only find BIOS firmware and some client exes on the official Dell PowerEdge C2100 downloads page.\n ​\n I guess my questions are, where can I find resources on what major versions I must update to and where can I find the update files for iDRAC?

Cisco, llumio, Palo Alto, ZScaler, and Perimeter81 are some ZTNA options we recommend. \n Using incident data and internal \"insert insurance company name\" claims data, we identify the propensity of cyber incidents based on company size (revenue), industry, and VPN Solution in place. An interesting stat that came out of our analysis was organizations using this VPN solution (Fortinet Fortigate) are 3x more likely to have a security incident. In other words, \"insert insurance company name\" predictive risk model has observed more instances of ransomware attacks at organizations utilizing this VPN solution. \n  \nWe are having internal talks now to decide what to do, but moving providers is one of them. I understand that ZTNA is better, but what I perceive as our threat model doesn't warrant me going that far.\n If anyone has thoughts or ideas of what to do, I will gladly take them into consideration.\n    submitted by    /u/slinkytoad69  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I can tell so far, the PowerShell script makes a legit-looking Windows message box pop up on your screen, telling you to call a toll-free number. Dial the number and you are cheerfully greeted by a foreign call center that will be more than happy to help you resolve all your issues. You know how it works from there ...\n All jokes aside about logmein - the fact that this URL has been around for about 10 years and organically pops up in Google search is disturbing.\n Who the hell would type a dash in the URL? No one. That's not how they get you. Because the address bar in your browser is also a search box, many people tend to type in the name of a website, and then click on the website URL in the search results. (Call it lazy or dumb or genius, but I can't tell you how many times I watch people type 'youtube' and press Enter, only to then click on youtube.com in the search results). So when you type 'log me in 123' into the browser bar and press enter, you'll see this malicious site prominently displayed on the FIRST PAGE of google.\n    submitted by    /u/ecar13  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know...).\n Here is the thing, when I send an encrypted email out of our organization it arrives in the code/web format.

It was pretty tool agnostic, and served me well for a number of years. Though I learned I needed to CYA more than most people would by archiving more stuff than most people would. I used a modified version of it for years with a decent amount of success with only a minimal of stuff falling through the cracks.\n I looked at a few other systems, such as Pomodoro, and one other one I can't recall.\n Last night, I started reading \"Getting Results the Agile Way\" written by J.D. Meier, who works at Microsoft. Many people praised it as an excellent time management strategy, and either a good replacement for GTD or a nice complement to GTD. I don't want to get too deep in the weeds on this, but a lot of his guiding principals just DO NOT work for me. His methodology is not about Agile project management, it's more about being agile in how you manage your work.\n At work, we're HEAVILY focused on implementing Agile. For my day-to-day work, it's been a COMPLETE AND UTTER failure. For all my project work, it's also been an utter disaster, mostly because I don't work on any custom development projects. It's all infrastructure upgrade stuff and COTS upgrades.\n I can obviously continue to use my hybrid method. But I'm curious if anyone is following a time management system that helps organize the insanity.\n    submitted by    /u/plazman30  \n [link]   [comments]",

Does that CSR come from the first application I am needing my SSL certificate for? I read somewhere that I need to first add the wildcard certificate to my ADCS server first and that is where I get my CSR using IIS. This part confuses me. \n In the future, when I need a new SSL certificate for a different application, do I log in to NS and create another wildcard certificate with a subdomain? Or do I use *.domain.com every time? I feel like if I create a new one, it will remove the previous CSR I submitted and break that application.

For some reason the original domain user account got removed from the system a while ago and re-added and - I think for that reason - it has a different SID now. Now, there are still files in that old SID's $Recycle.bin and I was asked to recover all of them to their original location. Those files are all still there, I can see them with WinDirStat.\n Now my first instinct was, restoring files that are still in the $Recycle.Bin shouldn't be too hard, right? I mean, they are all still on the drive. But damn, I'm doing research for hours now on how to do it and can't find a way. Luckily it's a VM, so first thing I did was taking a snapshot, so nothing can go wrong when I toy around with the filesystem.\n Opening the folder in Explorer with my Domain-User Account of course is not helping since the files are tied to a different user.The next thing I tried was simply to rename the Recycle Bin subfolder, that includes the old SID as a folder name, to my SID. After I log into my user account then, Windows now tells me my Recycle Bin is corrupted and asks if I want to delete it. So, I reverted to my snapshot.\n There are tons of tools out there that can recover deleted files from NTFS, but seemingly no tools to recover still existing files from the recycler?\n    submitted by    /u/BFYoda  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am the lone sysadmin of a small 25 person office.\n ​\n We have a laptop refresh coming up - 25 Lenovo T14 laptops running Win10.\n We don't deploy new laptops very often - maybe every 5 years. We do not have an imaging infrastructure in place.\n I would like to keep things as simple as possible as I have other things on my To-Do list.\n Here is my plan: Please feel free to comment or add some advice as you see fit.\n ​\n  \nI plan on building out one of the new Lenovos with all our software and the latest updates.\n \nThen sysprep it.\n Use Clonezilla to capture the image onto an SSD or thumb drive\n Then set up a small mini lab where we can deploy 4 or 5 laptops at a time with the image\n Add newly imaged laptops to domain and tweak for individual users (mapped drives, bookmarks, etc.)\n  \nQuestion. I plan on just using a thumb drive to boot up Clonzilla on the laptops and using a local SSD drive or thumb drive to host the image file for each laptop. Would it make a speed difference if I store the image file on an SSD USB -C drive as opposed to a regular USB-A drive? \n ​\n Thanks guys for any wisdom.\n    submitted by    /u/javajo91  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sounds a lot to me like they’re trying to con people into their new pricing scheme before everyone jumps ship when Broadcom fully takes over and destroys their product just like they have for everything else. I was trying to remain hopeful that maybe this time it would be different but…Broadcom hasn’t even fully taken over yet and they’ve already almost doubled my licensing cost per year with this new scheme, what a scam. I got a laugh when I got the cautionary reminder at the end of the email “the price can be locked in year over year with VSphere+, but the price can’t be guaranteed when you’re up for renewal next year if you don’t go with the proposed pricing”. \n Needless to say, I’m going to talk to my team about it all but I believe we’re are going to be in the market for something else.

          "description": "We recently had a switch in our website hosting provider and I'm hitting my head against the wall on what I'm missing here. Everything works externally, but we have a split-brain DNS setup in our internal network. It's been set up that way for a long time and it's not something I can completely remove unfortunately, at least not right now.\n So externally, www.domain.com resolves and is proxied through Cloudflare and life is good. (see screenshot in attached album)\n Internally, however, is where things aren't currently working. Our previous hosting provider had a trusted CA issued cert installed on the origin server, and so we could simply point our internal DNS to the same public IP that CF was pointed to and everything would work fine. This new hosting provider insists on having a self signed cert on their side however. Why this is I'm still trying to figure out in my continued discussions with them, but for now that's what we've got and obviously that causes issues with 'site unsecure' warnings if we set it up like we had done before.\n So what I was trying to do is simply point our internal DNS to the CF proxied route, and per here and here I was under the impression I could simply create a CNAME entry for www.domain.com and point it to www.domain.com.cdn.cloudflare.net. (see screenshot in attached album). But clearly I'm still missing something because even with that things aren't working - Chrome gives an \"ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED\" error even though NSLOOKUP seems to resolve to the CF IP's just fine (again, see screenshots in attached album). \n Anyone dealt with a similar issue before?

Between us we also took care of all the different hardware and software people use. We have around 200 employees across parttime to fulltime.\n The other guy was beginning to slack a bit, came in late and did not always do his tasks, so the CEO had made a plan with me where I should be the head of IT in 6 to 12 months and we should hire more people, at minimum a Sysadmin and a Supporter.\n We had not yet presented the plan for my colleague.\n Yesterday they found my colleague dead in his apartment, and I got a call from the CEO about it, where he stated that I was now head of IT and should start as soon as possible.\n My plan is to start securing we have access to all the systems he worked with, and create a common password database in something like Bitwarden. Then talk to all the different departments about what projects they had going on, and how to get support moving forward.\n I could really use some advise, where would you guys start?\n Rest in piece other guy, I will keep your lasts sessions online for as long ass possible.

Some of these switches are 10-20 years old, and absolutely cannot support any form of MFA, even RADIUS.

A baseline in sccm to check folders are in the expected locations. Eg. C:\\users\\Geoff\\onedrive - contoso\\desktop (or pictures or documents) 2. The admin reports policy so we can use the reports at confit.microsoft.com\n We hit go and watched with glee as the admin report went from 0% to around 90%. Never got to 100.. and forgot about it all as we moved to more important things.\n Now I’m reviewing our settings and status and I’ve found a couple of weird things\n Firstly some users have moved their folders into random folders, or so it would seem, like into the sub folder of some obscure project. Too few to be a mis configuration, too many for it to be accidental drag and drops.\n Secondly the admin reports have gone backwards, sitting at 75% or so\n Has anyone else had these experiences?

I did buy a server for my SME back in 2019 which sadly broke down about 2months ago. After testing thoroughly and going to multiple stores that said they can fix this server. I found out its the board and the cpu that died and since Dell emailed back telling me that theres nothing they'll do because it was a few month after the warranty ended and fixing would cost as much as buying it new any board/cpu I should know that would fit right with the components I already have? I remember back when I was reusing dell's gaming pc, the mb would have its front io pins which will not work with normal pc cases in the market. I did find my way around by buying front IO cables from china that was modified for dell's front IO. I am not sure if I am wasting my time trying to fix this server, will it be difficult to find a board that fits the case? \n The server was a EMC R340 bought in 2019 with Xeon E 2124 + R171TT1 MB 17086-1 \n https://imgur.com/a/SsKPcC0\n https://imgur.com/a/YoV7TEr \n https://imgur.com/a/v0r6m9g\n    submitted by    /u/Neither-Blacksmith18  \n [link]   [comments]",

Let's call them:\n CompanyOnPrem. com\n CompanyCloud. com\n The embedded ID authenticates against CompanyOnPrem. com\\account1. This account is synchronized with AzureAD so it has the correct rights in CompanyCloud, but of course the programs won't install because CompanyOnPrem is also embedded in the install file. \n HOWEVER!

I try to advocate that a functional change control process should not slow down change but encourage it.\n Additionally, we had an incident occur with one of our services recently and while the response was ok, nothing was written down by my team members. No incident ticket, no post-incident review, nothing. Service is back up, incident over. I'd assume that each person has their own personal notepad++ open to write down the incident response notes.\n My direct suggested I make a proposal things I would like implement, i.e. a system for tracking changes, ongoing problems, incidents etc. but as I'm writing the proposal I find myself wondering what I'm even doing.

          "description": "This is an odd request, but please hear me out. My company provides control panels with very small (like 2-3 device) isolated TCP/IP networks. Occasionally, a device needs to be serviced by connecting a laptop with programming software installed. This software interacts over a TCP/IP connection with the devices in the panel. The software is expensive, difficult to install, and difficult to license. It is not something we could just send an installer to our customers to install on a local laptop, most of the time. Furthermore, asking to remote into a customer's machine would be seen as unprofessional in this industry.\n I may post a similar question on /r/plc where I normally hang out, but I am looking for something more than the current ways I've seen/done this:\n  \nVERY EXPENSIVE - drive or fly to the site just to plug in an ethernet cable to the laptop with the right software on it.\n MEDIUM EXPENSE - send a laptop with the software installed to site with instructions for site personnel to get it connected to the panel's switch. This ties up a full set of software licenses (this can be 5 figure licenses)\n MEDIUM EXPENSE - send or permanently install a dedicated cellular VPN box (usually netbiter, eWon or Secomea) out that puts the engineer's licensed laptop on the panel's network\n LOWEST EXPENSE - if the customer has the right combination of competency and flexibility in their IT dept, set up VPN access to the network \n  \nOk, so here's where I'm wondering if there's a 5th option. Is there a way to set up a laptop that just functions as a VPN server, rather than client. Like, is there a cisco or whatever program I can install on a win10/11 laptop that, when running, allows remote vpn clients to access the laptop's local network? \n All of the above is typically done as supervised, extremely temporary connections to these systems. I am aware these all represent security risks except #1. Please refrain from chastising my industry for our security practices.\n    submitted by    /u/InstAndControl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I work maybe 6-7h each day, really not that much compared to what I read from other guys in this sub. However during that time I am hyper focused. The only break that I take is 30 minutes for lunch, and I mean really no other break at all. I don’t kick back in my seat, take care of personal stuff or get up to walk around the room for a bit. Instead I jump from one task to the next, whether that’s a meeting, monitoring alert, ticket, project, chat message, email, you name it. The stimulation is just so intense that I can’t get out once I’m in. What I don’t realize during that time is that I’m completely overstimulating by brain. I don’t give it time to process anything. So once I stop working my mind starts racing about everything I touched throughout the workday. I go over the meeting in my head, I think about if I forgot something on the ticket I worked on, if the next steps for the project are correct, etc. I go to bed with these thoughts and I wake up with them. Only after about 2 days of not working (typically on Sundays or today after a holiday) the thoughts start to slow down. This really sucks because I am not fully present with my family unless I’m on holiday and generally I’m just burning myself out. I know what I shouldn’t be doing but I just can’t stop it. I tried a couple of things to mitigate that:\n  \nA physical alert on my desk which goes off after 2h to remind me to get up (which I happily ignore once I’m into the vortex)\n A tool on my computer which actually blocks the screen for 5 minutes to force a break (which annoyed me too much when I was deep into something or in a meeting)\n Countless of post-its to remind me of breaks (which you guessed it, I ignore)\n  \nHave any of you experienced the same and found a solution to this?\n PS: I should mention that neither my boss or any external factor are forcing this behavior on me. While I had jobs in the past where that was the case, today it’s not.\n    submitted by    /u/Puzzles9193  \n [link]   [comments]",

All DCs support only \"RC4, AES 128, AES 256\" encryption types (no DES). \n Some AD accounts (mostly computer objects for Linux systems with Centrify agent installed) support only \"DES, RC4\".\n Some other accounts (also Centrify systems) support \"DES, RC4, AES128, AES256\". The rest (vast majority Windows systems, nothing lower than W2K12R2/Win10) of accounts don't support DES at all. \n Question 1: Without the DCs supporting for DES, is having \"DES\" as a supported type on a bunch of computer objects an actual risk item? We are logging everything into Splunk and there are zero events indicating DES is in use. These accounts turned up in an internal audit, but the actual risk seems non-existent. We will remediate them anyway but I'm wanting to be clear on the risk for management discussions. \n Question 2: Right now in Splunk I see AES in use, but also RC4 being used, even involving systems that have support for AES128 and AES256. I think I've read that once we switch to W2K19 DCs this behavior will change, and the DCs will start negotiating with the highest encryption level available. Is that accurate? We want to work towards phasing out RC4, so if the above is true, we should immediately see a big drop in RC4 traffic after we swap out our DCs this summer.\n    submitted by    /u/BrettStah  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We've had a phishing campaign target users within our company, all the usual markers aren't present, so this hasn't been quarantined by our Email Gateway.\n Pretty much, each email sent comes from a different mail server (all \"good / neutral\" reputation), they're all different in content, but all have a \"*.pdf\" attached (no set naming scheme to these either).\n Each of the emails only goes to a few users so isn't being caught via \"bulk\" sending either. Obviously we've been adding the mail servers into the block lists along with the domains as they come in.\n We've had KnowBe4 running campaigns for years now, so our end users knew what to do (don't open anything, report it, etc.). We sent out an email to all users, just informing them of what is happening, and to be vigilant.\n I don't think much more can be done to prevent this, other than keep up training for users, keep them informed of threats (as we've done).\n All the mail servers aren't within our country and we don't do much business outside of this country, so I could restrict all inbound mail just to our country (then just allow through what's need when it's needed).\n I have got a support case open with our Email Gateway provider, as a few of these emails used the name of end users and should of been caught by \"Impersonation Prevention\" but it marked them as \"Legitimate\".\n Any suggestions?

I have been tasked with creating an automatic warranty checker for Dell servers, and I am hoping to use Nagios to achieve this. I have found an API for Nagios that was created in 2012, but unfortunately, it is no longer functional. I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with creating a Dell server warranty checker using Nagios and would be able to offer any guidance.\n The objective of this project is to create a system that will allow Nagios to self-check the Dell website by service tag and display the warranty status of the server in Nagios, or alternatively, send an email notification. This would help us keep track of the warranty status of our servers and allow us to take action before the warranty expires.\n I would appreciate any help or guidance on this matter, whether it be through pointing me in the direction of helpful resources, providing suggestions on how to tackle this project, or sharing personal experiences with similar projects.\n Thank you in advance for your assistance!\n    submitted by    /u/RelativeStatement341  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We have more than 10 office users using chrome on a daily basis.\n Two days ago some of them notified me that the print preview takes literally ages to load. I stayed after work to check and it not only takes more than two minutes to load but it also crashes chrome 1/3 times.\n I scraped the internet for a solution and tried a bunch of stuff and ended up fixing it by manually installing new Post script drivers on all 10 machines for all 3 office printers.\n The preview now works without crashing Chrome but it still takes about 5 seconds to load (a big improvement over the 2 minutes it used to take). Naturally everyone is still complaining because according to them it used to be instantaneous before.\n Im all out of ideas here so any tips would be really appreciated. One option is obviously to just use another browser but it’s an unpopular option as “they’re all really used to chrome and how it looks”\n Pls help.\n    submitted by    /u/NewHum  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was ready to decommission the final 2012R2 DC but when testing via a shutdown, I experienced an outage. \n Our intranet, hosted on Google Cloud on Ubuntu, requires a sign in with an active directory credential to access (email address + password via LDAP). Despite changing the IP of the VM's DNS server to match our new DC's (one on GCP and one on prem), the moment I turn off the old DC is the moment authentication on this server fails, and staff instead get an \"Internal Server Error\" page from apache. \n Digging into the apache config, I can see the authentication is using LDAP, with the following section;\n ## Active Directory AuthBasicProvider ldap AuthLdapBindDN readonly@int.domain.net AuthLdapBindPassword AuthLdapBindURL ldap://int.domain.net:3268/?userPrincipleName?sub \n Three things about this;\n 1 - Even though the AD account it's using to authenticate has the absolute minimum access, I don't like how the password is stored in plain text.

Or is not DNS at all?? \n 3 - Doing some digging online I discovered that it's possible to \"automatically authenticate\" via their user account if the credentials match (meaning they don't have to enter them in). Is this only possible on Windows/will it break a manual username/password entry? We have some Macs around.\n    submitted by    /u/segagamer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "After some recent less than desirable experiences at my job, I reached out to a recruiter. They have passed along a job opportunity to be the IT Manager at a Non Profit for me to look at. I would be the sole IT person onsite and the description lists everything from on boarding new employees for training to writing and implementing policy. Apparently there is a significant level of vendors leveraged right now, but it still seems as though the job might be punching a bit above it's weight class in terms of expectations and salary. The network size is approximately 100 end user devices according to the recruiter (computers). \n What are people's experiences working in an environment like this? Is there a chance it could be good? Or will it be an extremely overworked shit show? \n I will also add I have previously been a network admin and systems engineer and feel as though my only weak point skillset wise will be the HIPPA stuff. I do have experience working in a heavily controlled and audited environment so I think it will be more so based around learning the new intricacies VS entirely new concepts. In the listing they specifically call out that they will send people to training to ensure their skillset stays sharp. \n The salary is more than livable (85k) as it will be a great resume builder and it's similiar to my current role as an engineer. I wouldn't be taking a pay cut.\n    submitted by    /u/Professional-Bug2305  \n [link]   [comments]",

The budget for this range is exactly $0 and we have to just use a bunch of old laptops we have lying around. This kind of throws virtualizing all of the devices out as an option.

          "description": "Like the title says I have a set of workstations at work with an unusual setup. These workstations are a 911 dispatch center and each station consists of 3 separate PCs, 5 monitors (2 PCs with 2 each nad the 3rd with just 1 monitor), all connected together with a type of KVM switch that allows users to control each machine with just one keyboard and mouse and have the desktops act as if they are all on one machine.\n The KVM device is called an Adder CCS controller and the way it functions is each machine is connected to this controller via USB and the kb/mouse connect to it. The controller allows you to move the mouse from one screen to another but in doing so switches the input of both kb & mouse to the corresponding PC. The reason why we have this odd setup instead of just consolidating the functions to one PC is that we do not own two of the PCs as they are provided by external entities to be used with their specific software product.\n This all works perfectly fine on 3 of the 4 stations but the 4th has had literally everything replaced and it continued to cause the mouse to randomly jump around, the browser windows to refresh or close and lose any info that had bene typed in, and other odd ball issues. Currently we have it setup where the one PC that had the odd issues completely separated from the controller and other systems but this is not ideal as it requires the use of two sets of kb/mouse.\n Has anyone used a setup like this before and if so do you have a recommendation for a replacement product? A traditional KVM or USB splitter is not an option as they cannot rely on needing to use a button to switch inputs, nor is a USB hub as they need the kb/mouse to only function on one screen at a time.\n So far the only thing I have been able to find is software products but we would prefer not to use that and stick with a hardware physical connection.\n    submitted by    /u/fuzzusmaximus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am the type that if I write it down I remember it better than typing it. I currently have a controlled chaos of sticky notes.\n Anywho, I am looking at the Remarkable 2 tablet. I have a few buddies that use them and I have messed around with one and really like it. None of my buddies are tech savvy so I wanted to just ask y'all If you use a Remarkable 2 tablet and how you like it?\n I am also eyeing the Kindle Scribe, but Remarkable 2 seems to be a better note taker.\n ​\n Thanks!!!\n    submitted by    /u/Same_Ole_IT_Dude  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've just had my umpteenth meeting about the above topic. There's a view among the exec team that having someone manually go through the shared drives for each department would be too time-consuming and that there's a technological approach that would eliminate most of the grunt work by automatically categorising the various files (i.e. by identifying PII content, for example).\n I know there are tools that can do this - we've looked at them in the past - but my take is that the grunt work still needs to be done. All you've really done is come up with a way to prioritise what you look at first.\n - someone needs to check the files that are identified as PII to confirm that they contain PII.\n - someone needs to check the files that haven't been identified as PII to confirm that they don't contain PII.\n In both cases someone needs to decide whether or not the files need to be kept, or if they need to be deleted in line with data retention policies.\n Am I thinking about this the wrong way?

I've been thrown into this by my ankles and I'm having to learn a lot really fast so I'm making mistakes left and right.\n I'm trying to get an SNMP walk of a Juniper firewall.

So, fine, I got a bunch and then supplemented that with the Juniper MIBs I could find from LibreNMS's GitHub.\n After doing that the 1.3.6.1.2.1 OIDs resolve, but the enterprise OIDs (1.3.6.1.4.1) still don't -- I see this:\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.8.5.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.12.2.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n The SNMPWALK command I'm using is:\n snmpwalk -M \"C:\\MIBs\" -v2c -c myjunipercommunitystring the.firewall.ip.address \"1\"\n Any insight on this would be hugely appreciated.

When we moved in we installed a small wall mount enclosure with a lock for our equipment in that room. It is well marked that it is our property.\n About two year ago we found somebody popped the lock and installed their own equipment in our cabinet. We rose hell with the landlord and got it removed.\n Fast forward a couple month the same thing happened and we suspected it was the carrier tech but couldn't prove it. Since we are closest to the room our business lead on-site is often asked to allow service people in the room and we inform him under no condition should any carriers ever be given non-escorted access.\n A few weeks later we get a call that a carrier tech showed up unannounced on a Friday afternoon. He was informed we would be happy to schedule to have him return on Monday to be a good neighbor but if they couldn't escort him we didn't have time. They tech was pissed.\n When he returned the next week he still wasn't happy. Now we are in a small market so there are not a lot of local techs so we will run into him over and over....he doesn't provide service with a smile.\n Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and we have power outage and telecom issues. We arrive at the facility and find someone popped our lock again and unplugged the fiber from just our equipment (none of our neighbors).\n Before this incident the landlord refused to allow us to put our own surveillance on this common space. After explaining to him we would hold his company liable for any business losses due to their negligence to secure our equipment in a shared space we finally have a camera installed. I'm low key hoping the person who has been doing this is the person we think--we will have video evidence this time to take action.\n I hate having shared equipment closets of any type.\n    submitted by    /u/grepzilla  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each phone draws about 3W, though each advertises to the switch that it needs up to 7W.\n However, powering more than 5 phones simultaneously results in a complete POE failure. The instant a sixth device is plugged in, all POE goes completely offline. None of the phones advertise that they're pulling more than 3.7W at the time of failure. Looking at the power status page for the Meraki switch shows that it's using 13.9 W of 1612 W (???) available prior to its failure.\n I've contacted Meraki support, and they thought it was \"weird\" that the switch shows 1612 W available, but they haven't provided any tips or thoughts on why that is. Thinking the switch was defective, I replaced it with another Meraki 120-48FP, but the exact same problem occurs. I've experimented with different ports (including powering up the devices in different order), but the same problem occurs. \n The TL;DR version: Any five POE phones can be active, but the instant I power up a sixth POE phone, all POE goes offline.\n Has anyone seen this or something similar to it?

          "description": "Reflecting on my career one truth has always emerged: \"The harder I worked, the more they took me for granted.\"\n It seems counter-intuitive, frustrating and demoralizing, so why is it?\n Well, simply put: They get used to it. When you consistently deliver high-quality work or go above and beyond what's expected, it can become the new norm. People may come to expect this level of effort from you without recognizing or acknowledging it.\n Another reason is that people may not realize how much effort you're putting in. If you're not vocal about your accomplishments or don't receive regular feedback or recognition, others may not be aware of the extent of your hard work.\n And lastly, you're running around all stressed out and scaring the commoners. Relax, everyone likes Tony, the IT guy who moves like a sloth, and doesn't react to anything, we love Tony! But then there's Marc, running around, always walking fast in the hallways, slow down Marc! His clothes are a little too tight, go up a size Marc, it's okay, relax.\n So what can you do about it? The answer is obvious, don't give so much, pull back a little. Now mind you, and put down the pitchforks, I'm speaking to my IT heroes out there, the ones who go above and beyond, answer the phone during Thanksgiving dinner, or Saturday morning at 2am.\n IT admins work in the background, they get no recognition or praise, we work in the shadows, in the server rooms and IDFs where no one can see.\n When things are working, great! \"So, what exactly do you do here again?\" And when things aren't working: \"Hey, are you working on this or what is it you do here exactly?\"\n So relax, and don't be a hero, they don't give a damn either way.\n    submitted by    /u/paperlevel  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello /r/sysadmin!\n Just an FYI, I am about 6 months in to my first Sysadmin position and I have been enjoying it so far. That said, I am running into issues with a boss ask: Separate Domain Admin level ability (eg: GPO changes, ADUC, etc) from our existing Admin accounts. \n Quick background of our environment:\n  \nLarge enterprise with thousands of accounts and servers globally.\n Currently, privileges are tiered out like: \n Admin Level Accounts, Admin rights on \"high security\" systems (eg:domain controllers, SCCM, core infrastructure, Active Directory / group policy management)\n Server Level Accounts. Admin rights on Utility or Application host boxes. \n Branch Level Accounts. Unprivileged workstation accounts. \n Tiered accounts only have logon rights to their respective Tiered Servers.\n \n Domain Level Servers require MFA for Local/RDP access. Our MFA solution uses federation out to Azure to authenticate. \n  \nNow the ask: What would the best way to split DA functions to its own dedicated account, but will not have admin rights over anything but AD itself. \n My idea was to Remove DA from the existing Admin Level accounts and create a dedicated \"DA-Only\" account that would not have login rights to any server (or only to a utility box), use the existing admin accounts to log into a jumpbox, and utilizing runas to open any tools needed to perform AD administration. That said, I am running into the problem where I cannot restrict the \"DA-Only\" accounts from local and TS login as that prevents that account from any sort of interactive login. \n I would love to know if anyone else has done something like this or could point me in the right direction on how to implement. Thank you folks!\n    submitted by    /u/brian4120  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Earlier this year, MS put out a notice that they plan to deprecate boot.wim support in WDS. In a configuration-as-code model (which will soon be mandated if you are working in the US financial sector), many organizations are necessarily moving to Intune or other \"DevOps\" tools to do post-OS configuration and state management. What these tools lack is bare metal provisioning and native WDS fills this gap perfectly.\n And while I've always been a huge fan of SCCM/MECM, it's doesn't make sense to support that scale of infrastructure just for OSD. Likewise MDT also has a great many extraneous features and is, frankly, not suitable for the enterprise.\n I am aware that you can create a custom PE image that will boot to WDS but recent PE Setup OCs seem to lack some of the command line parameters that were present in earlier versions, and I feat that w/o official boot.wim support, custom PE support cannot be relied upon in a mission critical environment.\n And while third party and even some open source solutions exist (in fact I wrote my own a few years ago), using an MS provisioning tool to deploy MS operating systems is optimal in terms of streamlined support and vendor management.\n I created user feedback item here, Please upvote if you'd like see continued support for WDS.\n    submitted by    /u/1sttec  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm posting here in hope some people better educated and more knowledgeable than I am might be able to help with a bit of a technical headache I have!\n I play Rocket League professionally and I'm based in the UK. Rocket League is extremely sensitive to jitter for whatever reason and I'm having a real issue with it at the moment. Unfortunately, playing at a high level requires very low jitter.\n I currently use Zen Internet (FTTP) and have a high-end router and have noticed my routing to the Rocket League servers is pretty bad. Here's a link to a WinMTR showing the issue: Routing\n The first few hops always have pretty bad jitter along them and it's incredibly annoying, resulting in a lot of in-game issues. It gets worse at peak times. \n I have contacted Zen about this issue but they won't — or can't — do anything. I use WTFast to circumvent further bad exchanges and that helps a lot, but there's still significant jitter and I feel this is because the first few hops are still used when routing. If I'm wrong about that, please let me know.\n Ultimately, I'm looking to change ISPs because of this. It's losing me money and time and is negatively affecting my mental health. To my understanding, I can't really know whether the routing of an ISP will be good or not without purchasing it first. What are my options here?\n I'd be very grateful if anyone from the UK can run a WinMTR to the same server and list their ISP alongside.

Initially I thought the CMOS battery was also EOL but replacing that doesn't seem to help, neither does clearing the TPM either through BIOS or through Windows security settings. \n It's gotten to the point where we've recalled the laptops that have had battery replacements and issued new ones due to the amount of tickets getting raised, but the laptops are still serviceable so I would like to come up with a solution to get them back into circulation.

A lot of bugs and the documentation for Fresh leaves a lot to be desired.\n Therefore we are looking at other solutions but it's difficult to find out there, any tips or pointers?\n Our biggest needs are:\n  \nUsers being able to submit tickets to HR, and HR being able to easily view and process said tickets.\n Users being able to order new recruitments, HR then needs to be able to view current ongoing recruitment processes in some sort of list or \"view\" listing all ongoing recruitments.\n Users being able to send in work permits with HR being able to track current workpermits, aswell as being alerted when a work permit is about to expire.\n Integration into Salesforce and Azure is a must.\n All of the above needs to be exported once a month as a .csv to our HR master so it can stay up to date with the changes.\n Bonus if it has support for integration / APIs with Teamtailor.\n  \nThank you very much in advance Reddit, any tips are helpful and very much appreciated.

I don’t plan on dropping a bomb onto the existing employees/department so the most important thing is how to start working with/integrating into the team, while learning the new environment- but also wanting to give a good impression to new to me upper management. \n It’s a complicated environment so I’m thinking a list of infrastructure projects to help me get to know the team and have something to show my new boss. \n  \nchecking/learning/trial run of their disaster recovery and backups -tabletop exercises- what happens if server a goes down, switch b does, etc -meeting with each of my team separately to see what they have for projects, pain points, wishes -Review existing IT documentation -not sure if the political atmosphere leans this way yet, but if I have my way spending time in each IT role doing the job to get a feel for what they are doing/encountering\n  \nFind out how they are managing IT budget and schedule what is next to order or plan for on the annual schedule\n How are they doing contract management and are there any contracts coming due this year that I need to plan or budget for\n I have one project that is almost to completion that has stalled. I’m well versed and could whip it out pretty quick- How long do I wait before prodding it to completion? I could literally do this day 1 but it wouldn’t be appropriate. No one likes that guy. \n Non-IT side- \n Meet with all of the different departments to introduce myself, ask if they have any pain points, any currents projects, any future projects, any wishes, or anything else that I can do to help or make their lives easier\n So…what’s your first 90 days look like?\n    submitted by    /u/My_ProfessionalAcct  \n [link]   [comments]",

The company makes all new hires contract to perm and the track record is, if you make it 6 months, you are converted to salary (I have been here for ~2 months). I currently make $80k as a contractor but have little to no benefits to speak of. When converted, the salary is $70k. As a caveat, I am not really enjoying the work and can see why the turnover rate is sky high. \n I have been contacted by a company that I applied for shortly before starting this position for an interview as a system administrator. The company is in the aerospace and defense industry and the programs it supports are very intriguing to me. The role also comes with a top secret security clearance. I would also be getting hired on as a salaried employee with full benefits and a starting salary of $65k. \n My career goal was to become a system administrator and an engineer following that. So I could also see myself moving up or out of the Sys. Admin role within the next 2 years as well (if all goes well of course). I guess my concern would be switching jobs so soon after starting the one I am at and the commute is double the time. Idk. \n What would you chose?

I am not sure why that KB is breaking RDP for users but I hope this helps another sysadmin from trying to determine why RDP broke. The weirdest part is it is hit or miss as some users with the update do not have issues while others can't work at all.\n    submitted by    /u/christheitguy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We have 50+ HP desktops of the same model new in the box that need to be deployed in the coming weeks. Long story short - we recently had a cyber attack that resulted in us rebuilding our network/servers and we lost a couple of staff along the way who were the ones who usually handled our imaging process. On top of that our software packages have broken links and don't run correctly with the network rebuild, so we're not in good shape.\n The good thing is, most of our staff use the exact same base build on their devices, so if there is a way to clone one good image to multiple devices that are the same model, that would be ideal for this project. We have the software install packages, but manually pushing them can take 2-3 hours per computer and requires a few reboots. We have been lucky thus far to not need to replace a lot of PC's since the outage, and I was able to build several of them as spares to swap out if needed using the manual process.\n I know there are multiple tools out there that do many things, so I am mostly wondering what some recommendations are for something that will get the job done. We do have a couple KVM's so can image multiple at a time - but how do we package a clone of an image to push out, and what does that process look like - especially with joining devices to the domain.\n In my old job at an MSP, we just manually installed everything per device as we had a lot of small companies that requested maybe 2-3 computers at a time on average, so it was not a big deal. Prior to that I worked for a large hospital that had SCCM set up to deploy Windows on PXE boot, which was very nice, but I have no idea how that process was set up. Though I'd like to eventually find the time to create something like that for our environment.\n    submitted by    /u/Rocklobster92  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I have multiple computers I can create clusters (maybe with a technology like k8s), and with a bit of work, I can be sure to have near 100% service uptime. Meaning no matter what, even if something happens, another computer is going to handle the requests and everything will be 100% transparent to the end user. That's because the service was designed to handle such cases, maybe by running inside docker, allowing state recovery, and whatnot.\n But here I am wondering about cloud services (AWS and Azure for example). If my knowledge is up to date, these guys have big machines (like terabytes of RAM and tens of cores on a single motherboard), and they use a hypervisor to split these into smaller VM, that they can then rent.\n But in such a case, they cannot run a single VM on different computers right ? So what do they do if one of their computer suddenly has a break down ? If their architecture is designed like I described in the previous paragraph, then all the VM on that machine suddenly shutdown, and their services are no longer available ? So there is now way that they can promise near 100% machine uptime ?\n And even if you keep your machine 100% healthy, with zero internet downtime, you have your own generator in case of electric failure, how to you update your hypervisor ? Wouldn't they need a reboot from time to time ? And if you need to change components, how do you move a running VM from one machine to another ?\n I am not a sys admin btw, I do datascience and AI, so way more math and way less programming, but I am deeply interested in how they solved the problem, so don't hesitate to start from the basics, and many thanks for your time.\n    submitted by    /u/prumf  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey Everyone,\n So we are running Azure AD Connect and just hybrid syncing Edge. The auto login works fine.\n We have no licenses besides the free Azure AD Connect. The Edge Sync has always worked fine, bookmarks, etc.\n Suddenly I have all of my existing users still syncing, even if logging into a workstation they have never used before. But somewhere along the line new user accounts after \"X\" date are not syncing. It shows the following in edge://sync-internals/ \n DISABLED_BY_ADMIN, STOP_SYNC_FOR_DISABLED_ACCOUNT, Microsoft Information Protection service is disabled\" \n So after a bunch of trial and error, the only option I had was to do the P2 License Trial just to see what happened and enable ESR. And of course that works, the new users are now able to sync.\n So my questions are, \n 1: Has anyone seen or run into this before? I am seeing conflicting info about how we should not have been able to sync at all without a P1/P2 license to begin with, and other places say no that basic sync was enabled a year or two ago.\n 2: Since I have the trial P2 license, I have not assigned any licenses to any users, just enabled ESR. Can I get away with just a single license after the trial to keep ESR enabled?\n    submitted by    /u/xendr0me  \n [link]   [comments]",

Problem is UCEPROTECT blocks ranges of our IPs for assumingly no reason and it's getting pretty annoying because they are basically extorting us and our customers at this point for 100s of dollars. I was not to worried about it before because basically they are known to be scammy but recently we have had customers getting bouncebacks from Microsoft and Gmail services as well. Why all of a sudden is Gmail and Microsoft (Hotmail) subscribing to UCEPROTECT?

I'm more curious for those who would consider it (like me), and what factors you'd weigh into the value of that work. I'm obviously considering equal factors with work environment, on-call, benefits packages, etc.\n I think my absolute minimum looks something like this:\n ((Time To Get Ready in AM) + (Commute Time Round Trip)) * Approximate OT Hourly Rate * 250 work days PLUS vehicle costs for that year.\n So for example, a $72k remote job, to move in person with a 30 minute commute each way would really need:\n ((1 hour + 1 hour) * 54 * 250) + (($400 car payment + $100 insurance + $100 gas)*12)\n $34.2k more, or $106,200 total.

          "description": "Sorry if this question isn't super high level, but it's a bit more complex than r/iphone would be able to help with. \n At my job we had a bunch of iPhone users lose a good portion of their contacts. We have corporate Gmail and originally their email/calendar/contacts were set up in iOS Mail using Activesync. Everyone assumed that this information was a 2-way sync, i.e. for example a contact entered manually on the phone would automatically sync up to the cloud, and any change they made in the cloud contacts would sync down to the phone. Seems like this was not the case though and manually-entered contacts were only getting stored locally on the phone, yet they were still attached to the contact list associated to the Activesync account.\n Recently the Messaging Team decided to phase this out and have everyone use the Gmail app instead. Problem is someone accidentally cut off the Activesync access before End User Support had a chance to migrate their data. Users started getting a persistent prompt to update their password, but this didn't work because the account was gone from the system essentially. People got fed up and just deleted the account, this process does not offer any option to keep stored contacts, you have the ability to either Erase or Cancel.\n Now in the texts and other apps there are phone numbers with no name attached. In some cases it's hundreds/thousands of contacts. Is there any recourse to get these back?\n    submitted by    /u/greggerypeccary  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you are one of those \"QB doesn't work on a VM\" people, please do not respond to this thread. It normally works fine, I have many customers on this scenario, including other DC/RDS combo VMs and the only issue is the conflict with the DNS server service. \n Anyone familiar with this topic knows there are two fixes to the service conflict:\n 1 - netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange commands\n 2 - script having the QuickBooksDB## service start BEFORE the DNS Server service\n ​\n OK, so hopefully we're on the same page here. Now to the NEW issue.\n For this customer, an earlier version of QuickBooks was working fine with the script-service-start-order workaround, for years. Then we upgrade to QuickBooks 2023. I know the number in the service name changed, I accounted for that. \n The new issue with QB2023 is not that the QuickBooksDB33 service doesn't start - it does. The issue is severe slowness in the QuickBooks program when the DNS Server service is running. Stop that service, QuickBooks runs well again. I have tried the excludedportrange commands (yes for the dynamic port listed in Database Service Manager) and port 8019, both TCP and UDP. I have tried the \"starting services in the proper order\" workaround, this does not work either. \n I've researched and beat up on this issue for hours. Asking other Redditors is my last attempt before telling the customer they need two hosted servers so I can move the AD roles and DNS off of the RDS.

          "description": "Hello there,\n I have a probably simple question about IP address management but I am very new to networking so I am grateful for answers.\n So if I have a Class C network e.g. 192.168.0.0 with all kind of devices (notebooks, printers, IoT etc). Is it good enough to give static IPs to some devices on my DHCP server and leave the rest dynamically allocated or is it recommended to also use subnets e.g. with subnet mask 255.255.254.0 to then potentially have 4 subnets\n 192.168.0.0/26 192.168.0.128/26 192.168.1.0/26 192.168.1.128/26\n so I can give devices in different subnets? What would be the advantages of that? Is this more secure and faster? Or am I thinking wrong and I do need VLANs to have those advantages? I know I can use both in that they do not exclude each other because they act on different layers. But other then that I am a little confused.\n I am very helpful for any links and resources to learn more about this topic or any hints what is best to do. I am not fully understanding the implications here yet I guess.\n Many thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Stranger-Stick  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm hoping this is a super easy question...\n We're currently in the process of moving away from Sophos to Microsoft 365 Defender for all of our fleet, and my question is whether I am able to combine onboarding methods without running into any issues? \n Current thinking is to continue onboarding via SCCM and Intune, but then I'm hopng to also deploy a GPO to catch any machines that aren't communicating back, or for those servers and other edge cases that have been kept off management systems intentionally. In these instances, the GPO would likely hit machines that have already been onboarded via one of the methods above. Has anybody run into any issues doing it that way?\n Side question... for the \"local script\" onboarding method, Microsoft states that it has been optimised for ten machines only, due to some settings that expidite telemetry data from the machines, so suitable for pilot groups only. Is there a version of this that I can run that would just onboard them with the standard settings in the other packages? My google skills appear to be lacking...\n Thanks all!

I'll try and describe it as best as I can not to waste your time.\n ​\n We have been experiencing issues with websites timing out for a while now. It is sporadic and doesn't happen on any particular websites. It can be one website sometimes, then it works fine 5 minutes after, and then five minutes after the website working before, times out now. One thing that seems consistent is when a website times out, it seems to be able to load afterwards.\n ​\n There is no real other network impact, internal seems to be fine, servers seem to be running fine internally. \n Pinging is no issue, NSlookup is no issue.\n I've noticed that when trying to load a website, it may be very slow but connecting anyway. In Devtools it will have a stalled time on 15+ seconds and the rest seems perfectly fine.\n We have a setup of 4 MS250, 2 MS425, 2 MX84. Everything is completely firmware updated and have tried restarts just to make sure. \n We've had 2 different network consultants come and have a look at it, with no luck. I've written to our ISP but the issue seems to be non existent when connecting directly to our Edge router, so they're positive the issue is at our end, and the consultants are positive the issue is at the ISP end. \n We are at a loss, and this is why I turn to reddit in my final hour of sanity.

I've been tasked with data migration in SharePoint online sites, initially the \"guru\" admin said automation is not possible and we've all concluded that I can do this in 3-4 months, and during a couple of weeks, I was able to create a small script that can almost automate the entire process. With this script, I could move thousands of sites in just a few days, possibly even over a weekend.\n Here's my problem: I'm not sure if I should tell my boss about this script or not. On one hand, it could save the company a lot of time and resources, and I believe it's something they should know. On the other hand, I don't want to risk getting only a pat on the back for all my hard work.\n So my question is, should I tell my boss about my script? And if I do, how do I approach the conversation and ask for some sort of bonus or remuneration for my efforts?\n Some important context that I've missed out:\n  \nI work for a subsidiary company, they pay me and my salary is almost x3 time bigger than it was a year ago\n Theres an ongoing discussion of invoicing my time for the parent company since I've already helped them a lot and they realised that they need me.

Granted he's pretty good at tricking out his desktop theme but his 'ideas' are usually VERY bad. In this weeks drama, I have setup our DNS servers with load balancing and a 5 second health check. Boss wants to set our TTL to 6 seconds with the argument people using the site wouldn't notice the 5 second outage before the LB updates and we can be more nimble with DNS changes.\n Next up is a project manager that wants the TTL set to 12 hours so we can fix any DNS issues before anybody notices.\n I have spent 3 hours in a meeting with both of them trying explain why we want longer ttl than 6 seconds, but less than 12 hours. Once I address the ttl that's too short, the other says \"great, set it at 12 hours\". Then while I'm explaining why we want it less than 12 hours, the other says \"great, 6 seconds\",\n It's currently at 10 min because the PM's project makes alot of changes to their site and want the changes to take immediate effect for all of the public, but doesn't understand that the 12 hour TTL is completely opposite of that.\n The EE doesn't understand the additional latency of clients having fresh dns queries every 6 seconds. \n They are wearing me down and one of the stupid ideas is going to win.\n    submitted by    /u/jack-dempsy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The target servers return the WMI Access Denied error.\n In another environment Batchpatch is able to Check for updates, see CPU usage etc.\n Using winver to check the build number, the build number is identical on the BatchPatch servers and the target servers in both environments. Windows Firewall configuration is identical, the servers are even part of the same domain, have the same GPOs applied etc.\n We have three questions and would appreciate any feedback on either one:\n  \nIs there something we can do to make BatchPatch continue to work? We thought it was the vendor's responsibility to make sure that their tools continue to work post DCOM hardening. And it does work, in one of the subnets as per BatchPatch documentation.\n If there is something we can do, should we avoid that due to security concerns? \n Are there any other tools for Patch Management you recommend that work 100% post DCOM hardening?

Hosting provider said its not a problem since those abuse emails are stupid and pointless and we did nothing wrong but they legaly should have a response from me and forward it.\n So we have a 3 basic servers, one for database, two for web application. Database is closed for internet, only available localy and web applications only 80 port. I have a openvpn server on smallest vps just to have an access to servers 22 by ssh and marketing guy could have an access to database directly (Before you will scream - the guy knows what is he doing and his user have only read access on sales table). So yesterday he visited competitors website to check their prices (literally clicked 1 link and left) and they sent abuse email that someone from our network IP visited their website ONCE and he wasnt on site for 30+ secs so search engine thought it was a bad visit and could derank their website. It's not a problem for this case, but they sending abuses on weekly basis like we have pirated scripts (that I wrote myself, just some JS popups), non licensed windows (but our servers are linux based), etc.\n We cant go against them in legal field since their legal entity placed in different country and just not worth it. \n What can we do or there any option to report it somewhere that they are sending abuse mails with no reason?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Zhuzha24  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can scroll in my browser but I can't type, open a new tab or even click on a page. The focus is fully on that application. If i minize the application, i can once again use my browser (or file explorer etc.). This is on my home pc. I learned to live with it since there is a workaround. Since I couldn't find a fix i thought maybe it was a \"feature\" of W11 and stopped researching it. \n Now i don't know when it happened but I'm now having the same issue on my work laptop which runs on W10. Once I open up PowerShell ISE, the focus gets locked on it and i can't perform any other actions, wether that is opening file explorer or just browsing the internet. I can scroll through whatever is open but that's it. \n It isn't focus mode (which seems to do something entirely else) and this is really disturbing my ability to perform my work. If i Google Windows locks browser, i get shit about locked screen sigh...\n What in god's name is going on here? Why are certain applications getting \"on top\", stealing focus and Ms/kb input?

          "description": "I’m asking because I’ve noticed a recurring issue with all US-based ISPs periodically losing all DNS information for an entire TLD, and all domains on that TLD (including mine) appear to vanish and go offline. \n Ping, nsloookup, and dig can’t resolve the domain to an IP. The entire TLD is gone, while all other domains remain online. \n Multiple third-party products, tools, and services confirm that the entire TLD ceases to exist for several hours at a time, which is very puzzling. Many alerts and notifications from our vendors arrive when this happens. \n I’ve reached out to ICANN for some information, but they are apparently not an authority for this TLD (it’s one of the newer ones that’s country-specific). \n The registry for the domain says there’s no issue, but they aren’t testing through any US-based ISPs. My offshore team can still access our infrastructure, while myself and all our US-based customers cannot. \n The registry’s website is also offline to all US-based traffic when this happens, since it uses the same TLD (*.et). Sites like downforeveryoneorjustme.com show their site as down when this happens. \n Very strange. Not sure where to look for answers. Thanks!\n Update: I’m realizing that troubleshooting this issue will require more experienced folks in networking. Terms like Bogon Routes, Looking Glass, ASN, IANA, and others mentioned here are new to me. If you’re particularly experienced in this space and are available for some consulting, or on-call emergency troubleshooting next time it happens, please send me a DM. I’d like to assemble a small group that can help get to the bottom of this US-only ISP / TLD issue.

          "description": "This is a bit of a rant, but I'm just wondering: I work for a small company with 700 users and 15 offices. We have 65 VMs (VMware environment) spread across multiple locations, Cisco switches, Fortigate firewalls and APs, UPSs, EMC SANs, Dell servers, Veeam Backup, Wasabi, SharePoint, OneDrive, O365 Mail (hybrid), Power BI, and 100 iPads (with a subpar MDM). The list could go on and on, and my point here is that we have only one IT director, one system administrator/network administrator/security person (me), and three helpdesk folks. One of the helpdesk people is amazing, but the other two just float by.\n My question is this: I've been here for 8 years, and I've noticed that we get zero training, everything is a dumpster fire that needs to be put out, management doesn't listen to important security changes that need to be made, and there are no policies in place, such as an email policy, internet policy, BYOD policy, etc. (I have sent all of these to management and HR for approval, but they just don't write back.) The culture here, as in the people, is great; I've never worked with such an array of awesome people. However, they don't seem to care about any structure or advancement of learning of any kind. I just constantly feel behind the eight ball and can never get caught up to even have time for training. \n Has anyone else's workplace been like this?

I have a M1 MacBook Pro which can only connect to 1 external display. I am likely buying a new X1 Carbon which can connect to 2 external displays.\n Ideally I can have 4 screens on my desk: the 2 laptops and 2 external displays. This means one of the two external displays will be shared by both laptops. How can I switch it to read from one laptop and to the other laptop? This also means I will need a switch for the mouse and keyboard too. What is the best way to do this with the least amount of wires and least number of steps in daily operation?\n Additional information for use case: the M1 Macbook Pro will likely be used as a desktop while the X1 Carbon will often be unplugged and taken out as a laptop and plugged back in again when home.\n    submitted by    /u/gradap2223  \n [link]   [comments]",

All of our printers have been in place for almost 10 years, I am taking this opportunity to hopefully standardize and improve the naming convention. If I can get examples of current names and why they are named that way I would greatly appreciate it.\n Edit 1: to provide an example of what we are doing, the printer refresh walkthrough revealed 324 printers, we have managed to reduce that down to 300. There are departments that have a single location like one suite and is somewhat simple, there are others that have multiple locations throughout the city. We currently have the implementation of the Follow-me printer and have many staff that use it as was suggested in the comments. One example I can provide is the Police Department and the many building they occupy and the multiple units within their headquarters, for instance I’ll make a couple up just for example: PD-224MFP01 or FIN-MFP02, for the first example Police Department/building/Multi-Function Printer/1st out of 2 printers. The next is simply Finance/Multi-Function printer/2nd out of two.\n    submitted by    /u/jimrx7  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't say if MRP speeds are faster as we have only had the MRP system recently so it was just being implemented when the lines switched, , but the CAD stuff would work almost as quickly as if onsite\n ​\n Now, what takes milliseconds onsite is taking 20 or so seconds (this is just opening windows, no manipulation of the MRP/CAD files). Speaking to our MSP, they have said that it's due to the XG overhead on processing and routing the data. But I genuinely struggle to see it slowing speed down so much. Especially as the CAD stuff worked file over L2TP \n If correctly configured, should we be seeing such delays over VPN? Onsite, everything is fine.

I've got a use case where its a small operation (<50 users) with a full 365 system running business standard licenses for all users. \n A few years ago I migrated our physical PBX system into the cloud, and it works just fine, but as the integration into the microsoft environment has gotten smoother, i'm investigating the option of moving from a third-party VOIP to skype for business. \n I know microsoft has mostly good documentation, but i'm more interested if anyone here uses skype in a similar environment and what your feedback/experience has been. I'm asking here because I'm not interested in a sales pitch, i want to know what it's like from people who manage it or at the very least built/configured it into your organization.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/kwirl  \n [link]   [comments]",

They recently moved to another office and finally made the choice to put some money into new server hardware, so we migrated their Srv2016 DC from an old ESXi to a new one. We didn't do a V2V (for various reasons) but chose to simply make a final Veeam backup and restored it as a new VM on the new host.\n At first boot the machine went into safemode (with AD repair) as we've expected. So we logged on, changed boot behaviour back to normal and rebooted several times to check if it's running correctly.\n Now, ~2 weeks later, users complained they didn't have access to a share anymore.\n So we've tried to login on the DC using our Domain Admin user and realised it isn't working. Screen says \"user can't login due to account restrictions or maybe wrong characters in password - as a blank\". That's nonsense. So we tried to login using the local admin account and there it says the account would have been deactivated (which isn't true either).\n Now we're stuck except for having remote powershell access (as system user) with our RMM software.\n I already used it for checking if some safemode has been activated (bcdedit) - which isn't the case.\n We also restarted the machine twice yesterday evening. Startup takes ages, but eventually it comes up to the same state.\n Anyone any idea?\n Cheers\n Jay\n    submitted by    /u/jay-from-the-bay  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Has anyone run into this yet? It is very frustrating for our users. We recently started deploying Windows 11 machines and ran into this issue.\n ​\n If the user sends a print job to our Ricoh MP C3003, then sends another print job before the first one finishes, there is a high change that they receive an error popup and then half the job gets cancelled.\n ​\n I unfortunately do not have the exact wording of the message or where it is coming from. It disappears too quickly for them to get a screenshot. They said it says \"Error Printing\", followed by the file name and I think it is popping up from the print task tray icon. There is nothing in the event viewer for these that I can find.\n ​\n None of our Windows 10 boxes are experiencing this issue but all of the Windows 11 machines have at least once. Our printers are on a 2016 print server. We've reconfigured a couple to go directly to the printer instead but that didn't seem to help any. I believe it is happening on all of our printers, but the Ricoh is the only one I have log proof of.\n ​\n Googling \"Error Printing Windows 11\" isn't really giving me anything useful as you could imagine. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/spiritcrusher  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was a previous edge case that allowed attachments with trailing periods to bypass the rule, which with the help of some redditors I solved with a little regex (see this archived thread). My successful rule looks like this in the M365 Exchange Admin:\n Apply this rule if Is received from 'Outside the organization' and has an attachment file name that matches these text patterns: '\\.htm\\.$' or '\\.html\\.$' or '\\.inetloc\\.$' or '\\.htm$' or '\\.html$' or '\\.inetloc$' \n But now I'm seeing another edge case where attachments with encoded filenames are also bypassing the rule. I determined that the encoding for .htm and .html are \"odG1s?=\" and \"odG0=?=\", so I added them to the rule, but they are still getting through:\n Apply this rule if Is received from 'Outside the organization' and has an attachment file name that matches these text patterns: '\\.htm\\.$' or '\\.html\\.$' or '\\.inetloc\\.$' or '\\.htm$' or '\\.html$' or '\\.inetloc$' or 'odG1s?=$' or 'odG0=?=$' \n The email source looks like this:\n ----==_mimepart_63f7bea11ed79_334ad8611585 Content-Type: application/html Content-Transfer-Encoding: UTF-8 Content-Disposition: attachment; Filename=\"=?UTF-8?B?NjUzNC5odG0=?=\" <script language=\"javascript\"> document.write(unescape('<redacted>'));</script> ----==_mimepart_63f7bea11ed79_334ad8611585-- \n Any ideas on how to get the existing rule to recognize these types of attachments?

My storage is Huawei Dorado 3000 v6 and network card is Intel(R) Ethernet Controller E810-XXV for SFP which supports NVME over ROCE. I installed the latest update, for Icen version 1.11.3.0, irdman 1.4.3.0 and for Huawei Dorado 6.1.5. I made the configurations based on the Huawei guide. ROCE interface are connected directly to the server. The ports have VLAN 55 for controller A and VLAN 56 for controller B. I created logical ports to which I assigned physical ports. On vSphere I created virtual switches for each VLAN, next created storage adapters with NVME over RDMA. The problem occurs when I try to connect the controller. When I type IP Address, vsphere finds nothing. Has anyone had a similar problem or know what else I can do?\n    submitted by    /u/tasiorr11  \n [link]   [comments]",

But documentation indicates that shared mailboxes are limited to 50gb. Historically, when we would offboard a user who's mailbox is bigger than 50GB, we would add in an Exchange E2 license to allow access to the mailbox.\n If we DID have an archive policy in place, presumably after we converted the users mailbox to a shared - the archived mailbox would disappear at some point?\n These discussions happening as we determine the best path our our existing LARGE mailboxes (who are licensed with E3) - that we want to get licensed for Business Premium. Initial thought is toss on a Business Premium AND an E2 as a top up to 100GB - BUT the Business Premium licensing DOES allow for very large archiving...

A couple of years ago I graduated with an MIS degree (jack of all trades, not specialized in any), and got a helpdesk position for 1.5 years as of now with zero experience in IT cause I had no idea what I wanted to do. The hiring person (who is my lead) in the company gave me the opportunity even when I had zero experience whatsoever. I had the opportunity to learn how to do some basic helpdesk stuff like troubleshooting, push software via SCCM, image/reimage laptops, intune, exchange admin center, active directory, etc.\n A month ago, the infrastructure manager saw me at the front desk and came up to me and we kind of sparked a conversation about what I wanted to do, work goals, etc. I told him I wanted to work on cloud stuff, especially AWS, and how I loved the company. He came back a couple of weeks to the front desk and told me to apply for a sys admin position for his team in the same company that just got posted. So, I did and here I am now for an interview opportunity for this position. \n I guess what I'm trying to figure out is how to do I go about this interview, this is something I want to do and I'm very anxious and nervous about how to approach this interview because I have limited interview experience:\n Here are some of the tasks, the role will be doing:\n • Performing daily operations and maintenance of the Enterprise Server infrastructure. This infrastructure includes VMWare, Windows Servers, Active Directory, File and Print Management, System Center Configuration Manager, SharePoint, SQL, Nagios, Rubrik, and Ansible. \n • Working with engineers across the enterprise to ensure that the Company's servers and workstations are patched and upgraded in a timely manner. \n • Helps develop solutions, design, and system architecture. \n • SCCM Administration • Dell/EMC – VXRails maintenance and upgrades \n • VMWare Workspace One and Horizons Administration \n • Active Directory Administration \n • Azure and AWS\n    submitted by    /u/kickbackbecool  \n [link]   [comments]",

Something which I'm not comfortable with because, well, my coworkers know me better. And quite frankly many of my former supervisors were less than on-the-level in one way or another. Listing every single one, though? Mmm no.\n Additional information:\n I should clarify the story a wee bit. The company in question is setting up a bid proposal for a contract with a government entity. The government entity already has something in place regarding work history and general trustworthiness--if they had any questions they could look someone up.

I don't understand people's need to get combative with users, especially to the point of pulling logs?

I need to Migrate their account to an Archive we set up which requires an app password to do. Unfortunately, I cannot create that app password without verifying 2FA to the employee's number. Has anyone been able to change the phone number for a users 2FA? We have 2FA set up for the whole org so turning it off just for this person isn't really the move. I have some ideas for general workaround but Im curious if anyone has experience with this. Thank you all for your input!\n ​\n EDIT:\n Thank you u/thunder923111 for the suggestion!

Some layoffs have been 30 days, some have been 60 days, some have been two weeks. But while you're \"counting down,\" you can take all the paid time off you want to look for a job. Some managers let you go home with your laptop and just WFH till your last day.\n Now, as generous as this sounds, they do this for a singular reason. If you find another job during your countdown, you're not eligible for the severance package.\n Well, we had one guy that had been there FOREVER and got laid off. He was eligible for well over 6 months' salary in severance. Out of respect for his long history with the company, his manager let him WFH during his whole 30 day countdown...\n 28 days into his countdown, someone from my company goes to another company to have lunch with a friend. And he sees his old coworker working there at a desk, with our company laptop with the asset tag clearly visible on the open lid. When the guy walks away from his desk, sure enough, it's our laptop. The guy is VPNed in, and logged into Outlook and MS Lync (This should tell you how long ago this happened).\n The guy comes back from lunch and tells his coworkers about how the guy they lost on the team landed at a new company where this guy they know works. Sadly, the manager overheard them talking. He called HR. And the guy lost his severance package.\n So damn close...\n    submitted by    /u/plazman30  \n [link]   [comments]",

I essentially consult but in a way i am onsite with the company handling all their docs, internal items, and other for smaller companies which is why i can administrate so many at once. I have one company i've been with for 10+ years but they got bought out and now have an MSP, that literally just keeps making mistake after mistake. They are never onsite, they move around reservations DHCP and change scopes due to lack of knowing the firewall, and generally cause the site a lot of issues. Which is great for me right, i make a ton of money off their mistakes. Sorry but that isn't my game. I like good business and administration, not causing a hedge fire and saying o well #xyz is just another client. Recently i did a large overhaul and installation of new networks, vlans, wifi, ect... Today i get a call they made more changes and now changed the firewall password essentially forcing everything through them which for me means extra hours billing to wait on a tech. Is it time to just let the clients turn into an inferno and go about my day or should i be grateful my income is probably going to double from them and just shut up and color?\n It just really freakin urks me how bad they are for such a large company taking care of a small hotel which is literally nothing to manage.

However, we want two stations in our office to be available for remote people to use when needed. In an ideal world, those two stations could be connected to any of the Mac Studios at any time. The Macs would live in our data closet, and the stations would be about 30 feet away near a fiber-connected switch (if that makes a difference).\n My first thought was a KVM, but I’ve heard that these are not the most reliable in terms of latency. Each station would have two monitors, mouse, keyboard, and headphones.\n Does anyone know if this is viable with hardware? My backup solution would be to use Jump desktop to remote into the stations via LAN, which I think would work just as well.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ReelBack96  \n [link]   [comments]",

When the process completed all staff were on E5 with ALL E5 features turned on including Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing.\n Evidently, Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing once enabled does the following:\n  \nSends an email to all staff with their personal Audio Conferencing pin information (most of my staff thought this was a phishing email).\n Updates all future and recurring Teams Calendar meeting entries with the new Dial-in features. This uses the Meeting Migration Service (MMS) - Link\n Sends a meeting invite update to all attendees for each updated meeting\n If the recipient has their OoO on, an auto response is of course sent back to the organiser\n  \nThe above has caused mass confusion for our staff and in some instances, users have 60+ meeting invites and auto response/OoO messages all at exactly the same time.\n It's on us for not looking into this more but evidently its caught other people out as well.

We are expected to review any tickets that come in and work on them if they are deemed by either the customer or us important enough to service outside of normal hours, permitting their company has a proper contract for after hours support or they get approval from someone willing to pay the premium. This on-call included driving out to customer locations if the issue is of a truly critical nature. \n The on-call rotation is a full week from 5PM Friday until the following Friday, and then 2 weeks no on-call for the other 2 on-call technicians, thus a 3-week cycle. The compensation for this on-call is 80 hours of vacation time that is awarded immediately on your start date with no rollover. \n IF they hire additional Tier 2+ technicians then the rotation would be divided among all applicable techs but it's already been six months and it doesn't seem like they will be getting more people. \n So yeah let me know what your on-call experiences are like and what you think of mine. Thank you.\n Note: Also for added context the company I work for has terrible procedure, leadership, and communication skills, and almost no one to fall back on if you have trouble resolving an issue.\n    submitted by    /u/DJSeras  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lately I've been debating whether all the money I'm putting towards a Degree is worth it or not. My long term plan is to finish my Associates program and follow that will several certifications. Undecided whether I'll go on to pursue my BA, mostly because of the money but my age has a lot to do with it as well.

I have the GPOs setup and 90% of the machines check in and install fine. I have adjusted the GPO so the machines check in every 3 hours to try and force them to download while they are online at some point throughout the day. Previously was set to every 16 hours by the previous guy. \n I have noticed the GPO was setup to auto download and schedule the install. The schedule install day is everyday and install time set to 10am. \n Is there a way to get the updates auto install at any time in the day when they are available to the endpoints instead of the set 10am schedule. If a laptop comes online after 10am the updates won’t install until the following day assuming it’s online before that time. \n Is there also a command I can run to force a machine to check for updates? I have used pswindowsupdate before using PDQ inventory to run a remote powershell command to check and install updates to the endpoints but from my understanding that doesn’t log in the update history under the updates settings tab in Windows.

It is a mix of brownfield for our current devices and any future deployments can be considered greenfield.\n There is a TON of resources out there on how to use all of the network automation tools/frameworks but not much information on common pitfalls and how to properly scale the network automation operation so it doesn't blow up in your face.\n So my question to folks who have been down this journey.\n  \nCan you describe your current workflow?\n What does the lifecycle of provisioning a brand new device look like ?\n How do you handle network changes such as adding a new VLAN to a switch and keeping the source of truth/variables updated with this information?\n Are you constantly polling the device and comparing it to the intended state? How are you handling a mismatch from the intended vs what is on the device ?\n Are you pushing changes made in the source of truth to the device in your workflow?\n How are you handling multiple sources of truth ? \n  \nI'm aware this is really dependent on the tools/skills available to the organization, hoping to get some inspiration and ideas how other orgs are doing their automation.\n Thanks!!\n    submitted by    /u/WittyAmbition4342  \n [link]   [comments]",

The scenario would be that when moving between hosters, I would duplicate the environment (i.e. firewalls) and then just flip the route announcements and the traffic switches within minutes and If I did everything correctly I do not have to do anything on the customer side. How realistic is this expectation?\n Do I need an ASN to fully own an IP range? In RIPE requirements (we are in the EU) it says you have to be multihomed to get one, but we are nothing yet as we haven't picked the new hoster yet ;) Or am I doing things in the wrong order, first I have to pick a hoster and then get the range. What do I have to ask the potential hosting candidates to be sure the plan is going to work? How does one own an IP range, is it tied to a person, organization, ASN? How does one move it around between hosters?\n    submitted by    /u/aivanise  \n [link]   [comments]",

I assumed this meant that I am to use an IP in a provided /28. \n I went ahead with the configuration, created the requisite proposal, policy, keyring, profiles (one for ikev2, one for ipsec), and transform-set. I also configured a tunnel interface and assigned an IP and the aforementioned range. That didn't work so I tried the next, then another, and another. No luck.\n So I asked for a meeting with the third party. Expressed my concern about not having an IP address to assign to the tunnel, it was met with \"well your NAT IPs....\" and he lost me. \n I'm not sure if it's my ignorance or his, but I don't know what to ask or Google at this point. I have read several configuration guides, all referencing an IP assigned to the tunnel.

The on premises data gateway app will establish an outbound connection via 443 with Azure relay which further connects to Power BI cloud service. The above statement is from their doc. It is essentially mentioned that the traffic will not traverse public internet. But how could that be possible? Because Azure relay is in in an Azure region and on premises data gateway is in our DC. Wouldn’t the traffic between them go through the internet via 443? Are they mentioning that Azure internal traffic doesn’t traverse the public internet and makes use of Azure backbone? I’m really having a hard time wrapping my head around this. Can someone please explain the traffic flow in this scenario. I’ll be highly indebted to you for explaining this. I do however understand that traffic will be encrypted from gateway to Azure relay but will it be over the internet? Or how does it work. They say this traffic doesn’t traverse the public internet. But relay is in azure and gateway is in our network :(\n Below is the doc link:\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem-indepth\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/mysterioustechie  \n [link]   [comments]",

It will take some time to verify whether I got a route if I attempt to to search this IP 10.1.192.1/32.\n vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 10.1.192.1/32 vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 | i 10.1.192. | nomore vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 10.1.192.1 show ip best-match-route vpn 1 ipv4 10.1.192.1 * --------------------------------------------^ syntax error: unknown argument Error executing command: CLI command error - \n It occasionally fails too by not adding the subnet or incorrect subnet. \n What other option do I have to determine the route that a host or IP belongs to in viptela?\n ​\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/1searching  \n [link]   [comments]",

Pings during those outages show connection to their sonicwall, gets to the gateway, and then dies out from there. At&t tech says that their connection is just getting over saturated with standard traffic, ran a pcap from their end, and no signs of DDos or anything irregular.\n I ran wireshark from a client machine and saw nothing out of the ordinary other than packets trying to resend during the outages, sonicwall logs show nothing, and during one of the windows when it always dies, I unplugged their network from the at&t circuit, plugged directly into it, and had no issues during that window. Next step is to setup a netflow monitor to PRTG and see what that shows, but just figured I'd bounce the issue on here to get any suggestions. Gut feeling (for whatever that's worth) is that it's an issue on the circuit that I'll have to convince the isp about.

Our primary site/headquarters is currently single-homed and uses provider-assigned IP addresses, but will soon be multi-homed and our new site will be multi-homed from day one. Each site will be served by local ISPs that do not operate outside their respective regions. We will be getting full BGP tables from each ISP.\n Each site will have unique IPv6/IPv4 prefixes. There will be VPN tunnels between the two sites, but no direct/dedicated connectivity.\n Would there be any advantages to having a separate ASN for each site? Would there be any disadvantages other than additional RIR fees?\n I am aware of something that Cisco calls \"neighbor allow-as\". Would we need to use something like that if the two sites share an ASN, or would the simple fact that they are announcing unique prefixes ensure that their use of a shared ASN doesn't get treated as a BGP loop?\n If it matters, we hope to implement RPKI from the start and we wouldn't want the secondary site to have a ROA (Route Origin Authorization) that would allow it to announce prefixes used by the headquarters or vice versa. (Such as could happen accidentally due to misconfiguration, or if the site were to suffer a security breach.) My cursory understanding is that we will be able to have distinct ROAs for each site with only the prefixes assigned to that site, but I it would be great if someone could confirm that for me.\n Thanks in advance for any insight!\n    submitted by    /u/centristfringe  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the process of replacing it with a 7600 ES+ card (76-ES+XC-20G3C) I had both in the chassis and pretty much copy pasted the config for each interface in use and unplugged the cables and SFPs from the old card and plugged them into the new one.\n Apr 15 10:24:24 EST: %TRANSCEIVER-3-OPER_ENABLE_FAILURE: Detected for transceiver module in GigabitEthernet4/10, module disabled \n Some SFPs were disabled. A few SFPs, I only noticed after I took another look at them are actually DS-SFP-GE-T, not SFP-GE-T.\n I added service unsupported-transceiver and no errdisable detect cause gbic-invalid, but it made no difference.\n Is there no workaround for this? In the first place, what is DS-SFP-GE-T?? It doesn't show up in the Cisco transceiver compatibility tool, DS makes me think mds9000 maybe? But it worked without complaint in the older linecard while it won't work even with unsupported-transceiver in the ES+ one. \n Right now I have both still installed until I probably end up getting the right SFPs, wondering if this was to be expected, on switches the hidden commands pretty much let you use any standard SFP with a scary warning prompt but on this platform it didn't even show me the warning, though it didn't have any effect either.\n    submitted by    /u/kumowoon1025  \n [link]   [comments]",

Simply trying to share my experience so that it can hopefully help others.\n For background, I have 1 year (three 4 month co-ops) internship experience, and have been working at my full time role for 3.5 months.\n Before anyone says anything about the 'validity' of the role/company, my new company is a huge employer and big bank.\n I understand this is Reddit and you should take my post with a grain of salt. You might have huge skepticism over if this is a true post or not.\n Luck/timing plays a big role. Clearly I don't have 'senior' level experience, but I do interview well, do have some work experience, but most importantly, I have my CCNA and DevNet, along with some network automation projects I listed on my resume (and no, not just simple projects from school. These are my own individual projects). I believe these factors were a massive help in me landing the role (the role said CCNP would be a nice-to-have and that automation experience was a plus).\n Another myth I want to shatter is about applying to jobs 'out of your league'. Again, by all accounts I should not have landed the role as I am only 3.5 months into my full-time career. But clearly there weren't too many eligible candidates and my new employer is deciding to take a chance on me.\n So just apply to any and every job that catches your eye.

          "description": "Hey Everyone,\n Sorry if this isn't quite the right sub for this post. I have a question about a setup I came across at a small business. I didn't set it up, but the current setup doesn't really make sense to me so I'd like some help understanding.\n The business has two DSL connections. The first one is their internet connection. \n The second one is just creating a secure connection to a remote server that they need to access. The remote server they are accessing is at 100.100.0.1. This DSL modem is expecting a client to connect on port LAN4 at a client IP of 100.50.50.254, with a default gateway of 100.50.50.1. If I connect my laptop to LAN4, assign a static IP of 100.50.50.254, and a default gateway of 100.50.50.1, I can ping 100.100.0.1 no problem. That all makes sense. \n They are using a Cisco RV042G as their primary Router/Firewall. This router has a WAN port and a WAN/DMZ port. Currently it is configured in WAN + DMZ mode. \n The WAN port is connected to their first DSL modem, the modem is in Bridge Mode, and the router is setup to login using PPPoe. All internet traffic is routed through this connection.\n In the settings for the DMZ port, it has the option to select a subnet or range. Subnet is selected, and an IP of 100.50.50.254 is inputted in there. There is then a static route setup for 100.100.0.1, to be routed out the DMZ Interface. \n My understanding is the DMZ port as configured is supposed to be used to give a direct internet connection to a specific device, keeping it seperate from your LAN, and bypassing all firewall rules. \n But how it is being used is more like a dual WAN setup, with no Failover or Load Balancing, but where all internet traffic is routed out one WAN port, and only specific traffic is routed out the second WAN port. \n Can anyone help clear up what is going on here, and what would be the preferred way of setting this up? Thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/cd36jvn  \n [link]   [comments]",

We tried to future proof ourselves years ago so we have ample campus bandwidth (small user count, 10G everywhere, DC and user traffic totally separated) so we never had a real reason to try and shoot ourselves in the foot with a bad QoS policy - but now with projects winding down we all collectively decided that now is a good time to take a look at it.\n I've been going through Cisco Live's breakout sessions and am starting to get a grasp, but the whole \"cloud hosted VoIP\" piece is throwing a wrench in my machine. Below are the guidelines that I'm trying to follow:\n  \nMarking DSCP as close to the source as possible - We're moving off of Cisco phones, so part of my testing is to use \"auto qos voice trust\" and see if the DSCP values stick with non-Cisco phones at the access port level, not just uplinks.\n QoS policies in hardware, not software\n Specifically call out VoIP as EF/AF46/COS5\n  \nWhere I'm really lost is the cloud bit. As far as I know, ISPs don't give a toss about your DSCP markings and we aren't peering directly with this cloud service, so while the QoS that we haven't needed before would (well, might if we dont mess it up) work internally, all this work is going to be for nothing if we ship VoIP packets out into the wild internet and they get trampled.\n Is this just part of the known risk when going to a cloud service? I've asked for some technical documentation from them and we will have meeting where I can pepper them with questions, I'm just trying to get my ducks in a row and not be an IT dinosaur. \n VoIP in the cloud, exciting times.\n Quick edit, I'm heavily leaning on this Cisco Live BRKCRS-2501 session and have a QoS book queued up in O'Reilly Books that I'll chew on over the next month\n    submitted by    /u/CleverSocialExperime  \n [link]   [comments]",

My understanding is that these guys are using XGS-PON for their access network, and if this is correct, how the heck are they able to claim to offer 10G? At best with no congestion from neighbors sharing the OLT port, an XGS-PON user should only be able to get about 8.5 Gbps in either direction due to FEC and other overhead. I can't find anything anywhere talking about Ziply starting to deploy any flavor of 25G PON or active Ethernet, so what gives? Is this just another example of a company's Marketing department having no idea what they're talking about? I'd love to hear from any Ziply engineers if you guys are lurking here, particularly about which PON platform you've deployed.\n EDIT: Mystery solved. Ziply is in fact doing active Ethernet for their 10G tier (this is the transceiver they use). Kudos to them!

Normally, we use PLC splitters, but a manufacturer proposed an FBT splitter so we can daisy chain our taps (ie: 10% of light going to the tap splitter, with 90% of the light going to the next tap). These particular FBTs are described to work in the full 1250-1650nm range, which is unlike anything I've read, but great if it works.\n I'm worried about temperature. Everything I'm reading says FBT splitters work from -5 to 75 Celcius, where PLC's can go down to -40 Celcius operating range. The buildout is in New England, so temperatures can definitely get down to -20 celsius. Does anyone have experience with this?

Please bear with me as I am not an expert in networking.\n I have a Synology 802.11ac router with roughly 60 devices connected. Guest network is turned on.\n About a month ago, devices in the main network started to not have internet connection unless I assigned a static IP. I don't understand why but this has just been the case. Almost every device in the warehouse is now on a static IP. The guest network however is able to assign an IP naturally and the devices work without static IPs with no issue.\n That all being said, I have an alarm.com svr and cameras that I had to connect to the guest network to get them functioning at all which is not what I want. The svr is plugged in via ethernet (it has to be) which tries to connect it to the main network. I cannot assign an IP to the svr in the app which leaves me with a dead camera system since it cant connect to the internet.\n I'm kind of just stuck and would like to figure out how I can get the main network DHCP server to assign good IPs again and get my camera system working.\n Thank you in advance to anyone who can help me solve this!!!\n    submitted by    /u/AlternativeTiger7649  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the same subnet I have other servers that are not slow. All computers in the domain, static IP or Dynamic, regardless of vlan, have issues connecting to server A. If I check the switches and router, we're running at about 5% utilization. Internet speeds are at gig. Someone from the company came out and said, \"the issue is on your dhcp network\". So I'm thinking, that doesn't make sense, it's the same network. If he couldn't pick up an IP I'd see that as a problem with DHCP for sure, but once he's got one, not sure it matters. He insist when he sets his laptop to a static IP, it works fine, but when on DHCP, no luck. His static settings match what our DHCP hands out (subnet mask, dns, gateway, etc.) Any thoughts on why only this computer, not on our domain, would connect when on static and not DHCP.\n    submitted by    /u/PlanetExpress313  \n [link]   [comments]",

I followed along with a guide and came up with the following for the first:\n NX-01(config)# monitor session 10 type erspan-source\n NX-01(config-erspan-src)# erspan-id 20\n NX-01(config-erspan-src)# vrf default\n NX-01(config-erspan-src)# destination ip 2.2.2.2\n NX-01(config-erspan-src)# source interface ethernet e1/2 both\n NX-01(config-erspan-src)# no shut\n NX-01(config-erspan-src)# exit\n NX-01(config)# monitor erspan origin ip-address 1.1.1.1 global\n Then on the second I have a different destination ip and different source interface obviously, but I want that monitor to out via 1.1.2.1 and I am guessing the \"global\" command i used above makes all ERSPAN go out the 1.1.1.1 address? How would I change it so that \"erpsan-id 20\" goes out 1.1.1.1 and \"erspan-id 30\" goes out 1.1.2.1?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Beneficial_Ticket_91  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is only the start of the list of things wrong with my MSP, I've come to the conclusion I'll officially be moving on. I used to work for the CA government and while it was not perfect by had a lot of advantages compared to my current position.\n I wanted to get feedback from everyone on the best types of companies to work for.

Got a problem here that I’m perplexed by and don’t really know where to start… at least before saying “the connection your using is garbage.”\n So last week we changed the domain we were using as a vpn endpoint… was a red tape thing after being acquired… We were told to add “vpn.domain.com” to our existing domain… Anyways the change went well… or so we thought.\n About 12 hours after the change about 90% of people could connect… Of the 10% that couldn’t we realized they ALL had Spectrum at home. No one had issues with Comcast or ATT.\n Now, we have two guys on a business trip to do some maintenance on our servers at an out of state colo. They too are also unable to connect and are receiving the same error message “Cant connect to the specified secure gateway.”\n My manager says its because we don’t have ‘DMARC’ set up for this new domain… Everything I’ve read on DMARC seems highly specific to email so I’m very confused how this would be relevant…\n Without going down a rabbit hole – does anything jump out here that I should check?

That being the case, there is a ton of information out there about MPLS and how it works, how you configure it within devices, etc. But one thing I can't seem to find is any information about the underlying Layer-1 transport for MPLS. I'm aware that MPLS doesn't really care if it travels across UTP cables or Optical links but what I'm wondering is this; For those of you who have actually installed MPLS circuits what type of Layer-1 connectivity have you used? If optical, what kind of optical (DWDM? Something else?) and how was that optical fiber provided to your company? If copper, did it use RJ45 connectors? Something else?

Goal is is to add a small switch in the press box and an outdoor AP in the stands.

To the best of my knowledge, we don't use the object store browser on the leaves themselves, we really only use the web interface on the APICs. I reached out to TAC and they recommended creating a new set of contracts and EPGs for in-band and out-of-band, applying a filter to block HTTPS to the contracts, and adding the leaves and spines to those new EPGs for in-band and out of band.\n I went ahead and built this and moved some leaves into the new EPGs, and the block works for out-of-band (e.g. I can nc -zv <leaf_OOB_address> 443 and get no response), but not in-band, and it's not clear why. Initially my thought was to set the filter to block 443 as a source port and add the contract as a provided contract, which seems to be what works for the OOB port. On the in-band EPG, I did the same thing, adding a filter for source port 443 > any and setting my new contract as a provided contract. That did not work, so I've since tried adding a filter for any > dest port 443, changing it to a consumed contract instead of provided, etc. I've opened up a TAC case, but they took a look at what I had configured and said it seemed right, so they're waiting on feedback from a higher level engineer to see if there's something additional needed.\n Does it sound like there's something I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/AlmavivaConte  \n [link]   [comments]",

The first 4 years I was your traditional networking engineer/admin working mainly on Datacentre and a little bit of Enterprise networks which I enjoyed but found the pace and travelling a bit stressful, although I think that was mainly due to the work culture i was in. I left that role in a hurry as the company took a turn for the worst and I got a Systems Engineering role focused on communications(networks). I've been here for nearly 5 years now and I find it quite mundane and none challenging and the pay is quite a bit lower compared to engineers working in I.T.\n I have considered going back into I.T but as ive been away from the CLI and \"traditional\" networking for a while I feel like I won't be able to. I guess you could say I've traded my hands on experience for more theory knowledge, understanding protocol standards, more physical layer including RF and the innerworkings of network devices and how they are integrated into a system of systems rather than end users. I know this is quite a unique situation but just wondering if any one has done something similar? Or has any opinions on me being able to get another job in I.T.

I'm just wondering if my methodology makes sense. Obviously there are better ways to do this but I was not given the lead time to setup monitoring and gather enough data.\n First I take the counter uptime in weeks and days and calculate the total number of seconds.\n TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS = (((UPTIME_WEEKS * 7) + UPTIME_DAYS) * 24) * 3600 \n My goal is to get a rough idea of the usage per second. But most of this traffic is during working hours and the uptime above is 24/7. So I divide by 5 since after nights, weekends and holidays I figure the vast majority of traffic is generated in just 20% of the time\n TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS = TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS / 5\n Then I calculate the number of bits from the number of bytes in the counters\n TOTAL_BITS = TOTAL_BYTES * 8\n Then I calculate the bits per second by dividing by the TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS\n AVG_bps = TOTAL_BITS / TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS\n Obviously this is a very rough average not taking bursts into account but I'm also taking some random 5 min average readings will pad the result.

We did a lot of mesh IP networks matching SAN network meshes, and it was amazing.\n I'm now in a position and we are considering using Edgecore/Wedge with CumulusLinux for a network rollout. I'm trying to figure out if its possible to do a PoD type network mesh design, but I'm coming up short as I search the internet. We haven't purchased these so we also have no support contact as of yet.\n What I have is a group of 8x racks with two switches per rack, and I'm debating what will be the best configuration to avoid or at least reduce having to do the classic multi-layer datacenter aggregation of switches to switches. We also won't be controlling the upper networks, it'll just be going directly into an ISP from within each group of 8 racks, and I want them cross-connected for faster local networking.\n If anybody knows if this is possible, thanks!\n I know I can create bridges between switches, that's fairly normal stuff. It's when you get loops even within a mesh that I'm less certain about.\n [edit]\n To clarify: What I have in mind is a classic star-mesh network from the SAN world, but in the IP world. I don't know if this is possible with this gear. It is possible with FastIron, but that might be the extent of it, and nobody else has done this sort of thing.

It has a pair of 16xge cards in it now. We are planning to add another card later this year thanks to some growth.\n I didn’t realize one of those cards was damaged early on and wrecked two of the backplane slots (:() forcefully trying to get the xge card with slightly bent rear pins in. Rookie mistake. It also has only re-s-2000s in it. It seems to be doing fine now with the four full tables it gets but I know I’m pushing my luck, it runs 32 bit junos (and from what I can read, only supports up to what it runs now at 15.1), and we probably will be adding significantly more routes over next few years.\n I’d like to get something that is newer but still used and has potential for another 4-6 years of JunOS support. I’m happy with the mx480 platform and am not angling to change. Especially since if I get a newer chassis I can reuse my existing power supplies and have a spare fan module. Is the mx480- bp3 chassis with scbe2/re-s-1800x4-32g new enough to achieve that goal? Latest JunOS for a while, full tables, relatively newish.\n So far as I can tell, even the current MX isn’t stressed out at all…. I really am just thinking about the next half decade more than the now. Rather make the change now than when more people will be impacted. https://postimg.cc/GBxyfqj2\n EDIT: the big cpu spikes were me switching routing engines so I could reboot them.

I'm aware in long-distance networks, propogation delay is based around the speed of light (1ms of latency per 125km, *when traveling over physical media). However, the figures I'm observing in real-life are higher than would be suggested by this.\n Example: The RTT between New York and San Francisco should theoretically be around 48ms. However, the actual figures observed are closer to 70ms.\n With this in mind, where is the attentional latency coming from, and is there a good \"rule of thumb\" multiplier that I can use to estimate latency? I'm aware that serialization & processing delay is a thing, but given today's interface speeds, I can't see how that could possibly add up to anything significant. Does the added latency come from the fiber optic medium itself? The fact that light is not traveling in a vacuum?

I am primarily a PON engineer so I am used to working in that space but as my ISP that I work for is transitioning away from Active E setups, besides for enterprise customers, and moving more to XGS-PON for connections, I am running into an issue with MDUs, mainly apartment complexes. \n ​\n We install a 48 port L2 switch then through the CLI, apply traffic shapers accordingly to what the customer is paying for on that interface instead of installing a managed router or some kind of CPE equipment. This is great and all being fed from a Active E connection or even now a XGS ONT since the apartment complex doesn't want to run fiber to all the units and want to re-utilize all the copper connections so we install a managed switch. So far this works for a dedicated NOC tech to turn up or down or apply different traffic shapers to the interface but that generates a lot of tickets for work that I don't want them doing all day long but I can't necessarily teach the customer service or billing people to do those tasks. \n ​\n Now we do run UNMS/UISP because we use it for managing GPON ONUs via UOLT, ERX, Air Cubes and other Ubiquiti products but I keep seeing stuff about the UISP Switch Pro being able to apply Traffic Shaper profiles and turn up/down interfaces with ease. Before I order one for testing, is it just as easy with the new CRM system to create a customer, apply a service plan and assign a port interface just in a similar fashion as the GPON ONUs?

          "description": "So I’m in an odd situation here. I’ve spent the last 15 years of my life buried in the CLI to become the best network engineer I could. I got my BS degree (bullshit degree I call it), I got my CCNA r/S, CCNA Voice, CCNP r/S, and I’m working to renew it into an CCNP Enterprise…. But I’m burnt out. \n I work so much that it’s crumbled my personal/family life. I’ve also grown into an alcoholic over the years. I’ve worked the 12 step program but with the stress of my job – I keep going back to the boos. It’s time to make a change. \n So I’ve been putting out apps for jobs that I’m essentially overqualified for – main reason is so I can go to work and not have to stress. I can set up a VLAN instead of design a whole VXLAN from scratch. I can make sure the link lights are up – instead of delve into the CLI for 3 hours trying to troubleshoot things down to the packet level… At least – this is my plan. \n I have a final interview for a NOC 3 position. The pay is surprisingly good for a NOC job and based off what I learned in my second interview – this job should be a breeze. \n So my strange question is – has anyone taken a step BACK from the hard charge “study everyday” mentality? If so – did it help your personal life? What’s it like working in the NOC from the perspective of a more senior guy? I ask because most NOC techs I’ve worked with were early career (justifiably so). I’ve never worked in a NOC but everywhere I’ve worked has had one – so I’m familiar with most duties. \n I’m doing this to save my marriage, personal life, and get my shit back together – and I’m blessed in that the paycut is not all that bad since I’ll be a t3… No they haven’t given me an offer but I told them my bottom line number and they still called me back 1 hour later to do the final interview.\n    submitted by    /u/Avionticz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi /r/networking\n I'm working with a client that's exploring options for SASE and SDWAN for around 200 branch sites. They don't run redundant internet circuits at the majority of these sites, so I have steered them away from expensive SDWAN solutions to accompany their SASE purchase; I don't see any value in branch SDWAN appliances if they are single-circuit for the foreseeable future.\n My question is: has anyone out there found a relatively low cost, IPSec capable, cloud-managed router with some level of enterprise support available? A good low touch provisioning workflow would be a big bonus as well. These devices would strictly be used to feed traffic from branch sites into the selected SASE solution via IPSec tunnel. We would either do a static default on the branch routers, or distribute a default via an IGP. The SASE solution will double as their WAN in this case, for branch-to-branch connectivity.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/tilphecklenburg  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is sort of like the \"I do/we do/you do\" concept in education.\n Good documentation/topologies/reference materials - Having plans of the network topology, where to find things, etc.\n Leveraging TAC - Pass off issues that require the involvement of TAC can help learn basic troubleshooting commands\n Trial by fire - Throw to the wolves on resolving tickets, etc. Basically sink or swim.\n ​\n ​\n Does your organization do anything special to ramp up new hires? For example, a Wiki or handbook or something that goes over all the different equipment you use with reference configs and topologies?

CompTIA or LPI?\n From the networking side, first I was thinking going for a Cisco or Juniper certification, but then I found Wireshark exam. Every now and then we hit problems where packet analysis is necessary and I only have basic knowledge in that, but once the data is gathered by others it's fun to solve the issue by completely understanding the traffic behavior. \n So I did check this WCNA certification, but to be honest it feels a bit like an abandoned exam.

We are currently in the process of upgrading our systems and I have been tasked with finding a way to setup our IP cameras on a VLAN using a \"router behind a router\". The equipment I have to work with is an IP camera (HikVision), a Ruijie router, connected to the office router and a Ruijie switch. The setup we currently have goes:\n Office router -> Ruijie router -> Ruijie POE switch -> IP camera\n What we are trying to do is set the camera up so that the office router could be on a network for example 192.168.1.1\n and the camera could be setup on 192.168.2.1 but still connect to the internet as it requires internet to be viewed remotely. I have managed to set this up fairly easily however, we also want to possibly avoid any rogue connections being able to access the office network if they managed to break onto the \"cameras network\". I am not entirely sure if this is possible as obviously the camera needs to access the internet. Right now, when connected to the Vlan that the camera is on (192.168.55.1), I am still able to access everything on the office network (192.168.1.1). Is there a way to avoid this?\n We also are trying to see if there is a way to access the camera wirelessly through being connected to the office network, however, again, I feel this may not be possible as right now, I need to be connected directly to the Ruijie router through ethernet to access the camera.\n Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/CMS03_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ok. So, I currently have 144 small mini computers (actually, 2021 Apple TV 4Ks) with a bespoke app in single-app mode that are used on film sets for displaying graphics on computer screens, with remote loading of content and a control protocol for color correction, etc.\n Works great.\n The issue I have is with the # that can be simultaneously powered on at a time and associate with an AP. I have found that Qualcomm's Networking Pro 1200 platform within a (wait for it..) Ubiquiti Amplifi Alien on channel 165 works great for my use-case. Channel 165 is the only channel I have available for use on a film set. All others are unavailable, especially DFS channels. These are never available, because of Teradek Bolt camera wireless video systems.\n On the Alien, I can easily power on 100 or so Apple TVs and they associate fine. But, beyond this number, I need to space them out by several minutes. If I wait a few minutes, I can easily get 144 client associations and everything works fine and dandy. But, the inability to power them all on simultaneously could be a problem. On some sets, this would be impractical, because the power for the entire set is turned off at wrap, and turned on at call time the next day. So, ideally, I'd be able to have 150-200 associations happen seamlessly and without delay.\n So, question is: what other vendors are using this Qualcomm Networking Pro 1200 chipset with 8x8:8 MU-MIMO on 802.11ax in an AP that perhaps has a quicker client association time?\n Had my eyes on a Ruckus R850, perhaps with a Netgear M4250 AV Line switch (model # GSM4210PD-100NAS) which has a built-in DHCP server, as we've had very good results with this series of switches generally.\n Thoughts?

Two issues with that are how to dynamically handle the exceptions for what is not tunneled and public WIFI connections that redirect to a captive portal to accept terms before allowing a user out to the internet.

I have up to 2 physical interfaces on each Nexus 3k's that I can use for these Layer3 links. The ASA has plenty of physical interfaces to work with.\n I'm looking for the most resilient configuration possible, with the hardware that I have, to advertise the default route from the ASA and the SVI's from the core switches. I would prefer to stay away from static routes (other than the default route on the OUTSIDE interface) if I can. EIGRP or OSPF would be preferred.\n There seems to be heavy debate about using vPC's for layer 3 links. Some say its possible, depending on hardware/code version, some say that even if it IS possible, its poor design. Some people seem to recommend ECMP from the firewall.\n To the community: Would you please loan me your experience and provide some advice for my scenario, with some configuration examples?\n Thank you all SO very much for your contributions. \n Mike\n    submitted by    /u/mike75020000  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe one of you can help me.\n For a shake test of an RJ45 to fiber optic converter, it must be checked for correct functionality during the simulated earthquake.\n What do I have in mind: My idea would be the following structure... Laptop -> (RJ45 cable) -> Converter -> (FO loop TX to RX)\n https://ibb.co/vLvQz5R\n Now I think I know that the UDP protocol is one-way and I can use a python script with the socket library to send a UDP packet over the laptop's ethernet interface to itself over the loop with the converter. If the packet arrives at the open socket, the connection is OK.\n Unfortunately this doesn't work. I receive the sent packet at any time. The packet is probably still delivered internally in the computer and does not leave it via the Ethernet interface.

When an incorrect password is entered on a client device I would expect a 'Password:' request message to be sent by the TACACS+ server, a reply from the client containing the password, and then a 'password incorrect' message back from the server. This does indeed happen, but then immeadiately afterward the client sends the password for a second time, despite me only having entered it once. This goes to happen a further two times before the server eventually sends a 'authentication failed' and it all stops. Resulting in a total of 4 messages being sent by the client containing the password (again at this point I have only entered it once). \n This wouldn't normally be a problem except we are authenticating TACACS against AD, which locks out users after 3 incorrect password attempts. Because the TACACS+ client sends the password a total of 4 times, the users is immidiately locked out of their AD account if they enter their password incorrectly just once.\n I'm seeing the same behavoir on both Nokia and Juniper (mx, srx, qfx) clients, and have now replicated it in a lab using a completely different TACACS+ server (TACGUI) and the junos olive image. I'm also very confident it is not the SSH client as it happens with putty, secureCRT, mobaXterm, and the buildin ssh client on a Linux box.\n I'm really stumped as to what is causing these clients to send the password a total or four times, even though it has already been rejected, and the user is not entering it again. Is this expected behavoir? Can I stop it? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\n Regards,\n Frustrated Network Engineer\n    submitted by    /u/jnewto31  \n [link]   [comments]",

With the new design, we are considering whether to change this. The datacenter core will be formed by a vPC Nexus pair. The consideration is then to transfer all SVIs ( with HRSP) to the Nexus pair. ospf should then announce the routes to the Nexthop router (firewall) and vice versa. In this way, the north-south traffic can be regulated and monitored via the firewall.\n The question now is: how can I handle the east-west traffic? InterVlan communication can then no longer be monitored and regulated. One possible solution would be to use VRFs on the Nexus switches. These are then routed to the firewall via a separate transfer network.\n At the moment, the throughput of the firewall is not a problem, but since we can connect servers with higher speed due to the new hardware, there could be an increase.\n What is the best way to implement this in the data centre in terms of security?

I'll try and describe it as best as I can not to waste your time.\n ​\n We have been experiencing issues with websites timing out for a while now. It is sporadic and doesn't happen on any particular websites. It can be one website sometimes, then it works fine 5 minutes after, and then five minutes after the website working before, times out now. One thing that seems consistent is when a website times out, it seems to be able to load afterwards.\n ​\n There is no real other network impact, internal seems to be fine, servers seem to be running fine internally. \n Pinging is no issue, NSlookup is no issue.\n I've noticed that when trying to load a website, it may be very slow but connecting anyway. In Devtools it will have a stalled time on 15+ seconds and the rest seems perfectly fine.\n We have a setup of 4 MS250, 2 MS425, 2 MX84. Everything is completely firmware updated and have tried restarts just to make sure. \n We've had 2 different network consultants come and have a look at it, with no luck. I've written to our ISP but the issue seems to be non existent when connecting directly to our Edge router, so they're positive the issue is at our end, and the consultants are positive the issue is at the ISP end. \n We are at a loss, and this is why I turn to reddit in my final hour of sanity.

I am fairly new to networking.(migrated from helpdesk)) One of my tasks is to clean the configuration of branch office routers. Most of them have outdated configs, especially regarding zone-based firewall rules. Now I am trying to go through all routers and to understand how they were designed(from a zone-based firewall perspective)(there is no proper documentation - so I have to reverse engineer this thing) . Is there any easier way to do this? Most of the time I end up with paper and a pan and I try to do draw a scheme. Any suggestions? Is there software out there that can map this stuff.?

I'm attempting to place ACLs inbound and outbound on all my VLANs, but I keep running into an error that there aren't enough hardware resources. In talking to Ruckus support, it came to light that the hardware limits on outbound ACLs are much tighter than inbound ACLs. In the Ruckus world (not sure if this applies to other brands as well) inbound means traffic going into the switch from the VLAN and outbound means going into the VLAN from the switch which brings me to my question...\n Is it normal or best practice to have ACLs on each VLAN in both directions? It seemed like the most secure thing to do to me, but if switches are built with more resources available for inbound ACLs (from the VLAN to the switch), is it best practice to only use inbound ACLs?

Will attempt to upgrade the other wlc tomorrow with Cisco support and get them back to the active standby cluster setup as it was originally. Don't think the wlc being in standalone could be causing any issues though as we have 40 other APs (also upgraded to 8.3) and have no issues with those in terms of speed of browsing for clients, etc.\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Intelligent-Bet4111  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our current headquarters core is a chassis switch (Cat 4507), with port-channels to other buildings for layer 2 redundancy.\n I've read a bunch of posts here and elsewhere about best practice for core redundancy, and it seems like stacking (virtual stackwise in my case, as these will be 9500s) is generally considered to be less favorable to having separate management planes.

First burden was to add 4 switches to a MLAG. Its restricted to 2 switches. Then there was an issue with connecting both MlAG pair with each other. It created a loop, even tho configured as stated in their documentary and made everything to shit down. \n Connecting distribution layer was a mess to. It looped again due to a bug with STP. Since you have no real centralized management, we had to troubleshoot on Firewall GUI, CLI and Switch CLI. You can completely forget about the Fortimanager integration. \n Accsess layee integration got its own bugs. Since were running a split vendor environment right now, we had problems connecting the switches to the 1048Es 10gig lwl ports. Had to do some config adjustments on the old switches too. \n Configuring these switches is verry „interesting“ too as Im used to CLI only. The CLI itself is nothing compared to Ciscos or Junipers. Though I like there firewall configuration, the switch controller GUI seems to be buggy as well. Some menues doesnt show all options so you have to increase window size to actually view everything. The topology view is buggy too as you cant even scroll in on large deployments. \n Overall it has not been a pleasure dealing with this devices.

At the moment, I am still wrapping my head around how I can get the two tenants to connect to each other via L3VNI. What is the typical way of doing this?\n About the firewall, I am still trying to figure out the best place to deploy it. Reading some Spine leaf docs, it seems the firewall is usually located at the border leaf. And the Upstream network is on a VRF-lite. Some says use the firewall to route between tenants. The global table seems to be just the fabric. Am I understanding this correctly?\n I would like to use my C9300 as an access switches and use VRRP between the local leaf switches. Is this even a valid design in the real world?\n Does the leaf need to be in vPC if I were to do VRRP?\n    submitted by    /u/forwardslashroot  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Currently getting ready for moving into a new building and I need a sanity check on my options. I'll preface this with I'm in the UK and getting stock of anything has been a nightmare since Brexit!\n New building is a training facility/office space with about ~300 data points across 2 floors. On average there's only about 70 users on site, but it peaks to ~350 with guests etc.\n I've been in talks with Aruba for a while, and they've finally given me their solution, which is 2x CX6300M and 6x CX6100 which is coming in at over £100K MSRP. Originally they spec'd CX6400 at almost £220K!\n Their issue is the lead time is 36 Weeks at best for the 6300, and 15 Weeks for the 6100.\n The second option is to go UniFi, I've already got an extensive UniFi wireless system already and we're sticking with Unifi for the wireless in the new building. I'll probably still stick with an Aruba 2930 at the core acting as the layer 3 router - I'm also looking at firewall options between Sonicwall and rolling my own PFSense on HPE server hardware for layer3 routing.\n The UniFi solution of 2x USW-Enterprise-48 and 6x USW-Pro-48-PoE is almost 1/5th the cost at less then £20K, obviously it lacks a lot of the features of the Aruba, and their Layer 3 stuff is laughably bad.But at 1/5th the cost, and being able to get it with only 1 weeks lead time, is this a good option or am I crazy?\n For the money I could by a cold spare of every Unifi switch and still be half the cost of the Aruba option.\n    submitted by    /u/thejonson  \n [link]   [comments]",

This will have engineers giving their opinions about a (fairly) new technology that they have actually implemented and their opinion.\n An example of a valid post will be:\n - We currently have Cisco DNA Center, and backing up this product is horrible (among everything else). You can select a backup destination, an NFS mount, but it does not have the option to \"keep x amount of backups\" or \"keep the last X backups\". Upon researching, I have found a bash script written by a Cisco engineer where you put it on the NFS server (its a bash script), deleting backups older than X amount of days. I realized that if backup was failing for a couple of weeks in a row and I was on holiday or forgot to check the backups on a daily basis, that script would delete all backups. It is such a bad design.\n ​\n Examples of bad posts are:\n - Vendor X has announced technology Y. This is a marketing/sales post where it was not a tested feature.\n - I have reused my old Cisco 2950s for OoB management.

I am creating the project completely virtually (in Microsoft Hyper-V), with servers acting as routers.\n For each network, I've created a server, switch and client that can communicate with each other, but I can't seem to get them to communicate between networks. As far as I know, the only tools I can use in the scenario are Windows based, so I've been trying to use RRAS, but haven't had any luck. I don't need to worry about an internet connection at all, so I've just been attempting a static route between the servers/routers.\n I've created this diagram (https://imgur.com/a/6D4VvNZ - sorry for poor quality). I basically need a client (192.168.1.1) to talk to another client (192.168.2.1). They can both talk to their servers (192.168.1.254 / 192.168.2.254) but I can't get the servers to talk to eachother. I have two NICS on each server/router, one with the private IP address and one with the public IP address (173.15.15.x/30).\n Has anyone got any ideas where I might be doing wrong?\n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Road-Boring  \n [link]   [comments]",

In a DR scenario, in my DR site I can bring up and advertise matching subnets/SVIs matching those from my production site - who theoretically just got blown up and is unreachable. I can bring up my VMs and infrastructure through replication. My MPLS provider speaks EIGRP with me so I can reannounce that 10.0.0.0/22 now lives in DR. This is all fine and tested.\n My issue is that in a test scenario where I want to bring up VMs and test them on their original subnets - I’m curious how you folks would handle this. Would you advertise with a lower metric and risk a split brain routing scenario (scary)? Would you suppress advertisements until you’re ready to be in a DR scenario (seems safer)?\n I can comfortably automate these types of changes via Cisco scripting/my choice of automation front end. I just want to be able to test these VMs from a sandbox in DR that you can get to via a jump box.\n Open to all ideas and possibilities!

Peer routing is enabled on both nodes.\n Both switches contains VLAN 40 and VLAN 50 with an ip address assigned. sw-core1 is the default gateway for the devices inside VLAN 40 and VLAN 50.\n These are the tests performed:\n When both switches are powered on devices on VLAN 40 can ping the devices on VLAN 50 as expected.\n When one switch are powered off (failure scenario) PC on VLAN 40 can ping the PC on VLAN 50 as expected.\n If during a failure scenarion of the primary node (sw-core1 powered down) I restart the backup node (sw-core2) after the boot I cannot ping any device indefinitely. Only powering on the sw-core1 restore the comunication.\n Is this a correct behavior or I'm missing something in the configuration?

Over the years, the topology was consolidated so that one of two core switches became the root bridge for every VLAN at the site. The appropriate number of MST instances for us to have today is two.\n We knock down and stand up subnets all the time, and every time we do, we have to pick an unused VLAN tag that is already mapped to one of the 21 MST instances—which is fine, but the instances have no bearing to what we actually do. When an engineer asks, \"Which instance should I pull this tag from?\" the answer is, \"Whichever you want.\" Consequently, things are so mixed up that we'd have to not only create a new MST region, but basically start over with our VLAN tag/subnet associations to get them into the correct one of the two new instances.\n I'm not clinically OCD, but I hate inefficiency and inconsistency. Hate. It. If this were a small business, I'd be willing to substantially inconvenience my life to clean this up during maintenance windows. But this is a site that has hundreds of VLANs, 600 users, a datacenter with 80 server racks, and a significant internet presence. When a city has poor road design, we all live with it because it's impossible to fix without knocking the city down. I'm thinking this might be one of those situations. I've never tried to fix an MST region before, but I know it can't be done without downtime. And literally the only people who even know about this inconvenience are the network team. Cleaning it up will not noticeably improve network function.\n Do you agree that we should just deal with it forever?

I can go into visit whoismyisp.com and it will tell me the name of the ISP I work for (and not TMobile ), and web browsing is as good as without a VPN. I can ping the private addresses of stuff on our network. But when I try to log into the GUI of any equipment, it just times out. \n That seems odd to me that I don't know how that can even work, provided I can definitely get onto the VPN. \n I am quite confident that reaching out to TMobile will be fruitless in getting the VPN to work properly. Any ideas what I could try here?\n    submitted by    /u/IllestAndRealest  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My peers and I are designing a new network for a school district, let's say... Fake School District. We've hit a good point in our switching and would like to move on to our wireless. In my mind, I would like the SSID's setup like this:\n FSD - Main network; RADIUS for AD authentication FSD_Unsecured - No PSK; MAC ACL; exists only for devices that don't support 802.1X FSD_Setup - No PSK; Access only to the site for agreeing to terms & conditions and downloading the cert for the main network\n I have a few questions about the configuration I proposed here:\n 1. Can I use the same NPS I use for the main network for the MAC ACL on the unsecured network? 2. If I register a MAC for the unsecured wireless network, can I dynamically assign a VLAN similar to security groups with my main network? 3. Will I need a web server for the FSD_Setup network or will my WLC (UniFi) do the trick? \n Basically, I'd like these scenarios to be true:\n Scenario #1: A student brings their own device. They connect to FSD_Setup, click AGREE on the site and it redirects them to a site that downloads the certificate and shows screenshots and instructions for importing it. After importing it, they connect to the FSD network, type in their AD username and password, then, boom! They are now on the Student-Wireless VLAN and can do their assignments.\n Scenario #2: A teacher needs a Chromecast setup to cast to their TV. I take the physical address written on the back, log in to my server and register the device. On the setup wizard for the Chromecast, I join FSD_Unsecured and am now on the TV VLAN.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Nbommersbach  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are running ACI version 4.2, which is acting as the transit for an NSX-T platform. Due to the implementation of the NSX solution, all of the ESXi hosts are both compute and edge nodes. So, the Edge VMs can shuffle around on the whole ESXi cluster. What this causes in 4.2 ACI, that we need to configure connected ESXi hosts * 2 BGP connectivity profile on each leaf of ours.\n Now this can be fixed with floating L3out on ACI version 5.2, but currently we are in the middle of APIC upgrade and then Fabric upgrade is next. (Corporate politics postponed this longer than should have).\n We realized as a new customer is coming, that we are getting to the advised limit by Cisco on 4.2 ACI.Verified Scalability Guide for Cisco APIC, Release 4.2(2), Multi-Site, Release 2.2(2), and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-Mode Switches, Release 14.2(2) - CiscoNumber of BGP/OSPF/EIGRP session per L3 fabric are 3000.\n https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/5x/verified-scalability/cisco-aci-verified-scalability-guide-521.html\n 5.2 Jumps to 10000.\n We asked Cisco and the answer was kind enough to say \"Yeah, the huge jump to 10000 is because, we tested with 10000, and we just tested 5.2 more than 4.2\".\n This doesn't necessarily gives us the answer we were hoping for. Basically, we would like to know if someone faced this amount of configured BGP connections and went beyond the \"limit\". We would like to know if any stability in the fabric occurred.\n    submitted by    /u/Storma9eddon  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n Lately I have been struggling to choose the right layer 2 vendor (Cisco, Meraki, Ubiquiti Unifi, etc.) for SMB customers who own many switches (let's say 20-30) and want central management for those devices so that you don't have to SSH/Telnet to each every time you want to add a VLAN o change a port.\n I really line the simple pane of glass that Fortinet or Sophos gives you to manage Firewall/Router+Switching+APs but usually HW is too expensive for smaller customers.\n I like Ubiquiti Unifi's APs but switches are very very limited and, as far as I see, don't support stacking for Spine-Leaf design with the core switch formed by two or more stacked switches. The controller approach works very well for the APs and switches, but the later are somewhat still lacking features.\n Has anyone tried Cisco Business Dashboard? Does it really solve the issue to manage and monitor all your local switches from one place? Are the switches good for \"prosumer\" customers (they look like SF/SG replacements)\n Any other solution you hace tried to solve this that does not involve an enterprice plataform like HPE IMC or Cisco Prime?\n ​\n Thanks.\n J.M.\n    submitted by    /u/garciacarral  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm working on an RFP to re-fiber my org's main building. We are hub and spoke, with the datacenter in the basement and four closets, one on each of three upper floors with the fourth in an wing off the 1st floor. \n Previous guy put in multimode fiber to all the IDFs, and it's only OM1. That was over 20 years ago. I'm pushing gigabit over it without issue, but want to go to 10g this year and work towards 25g in the near future, with 100g in the next ten years. So I'm planning to bring in contractors for a rip and replace, out with the multi and in with single mode.\n Question is, how many strands? I know could push 100s of gigs over a single strand, but that is $$$$$ carrier grade stuff... I'm looking for something more in the practical range, so that is duplex LC, or MPO/MTP, for speeds of 25g to 100g based on the Aruba equipment I have right now. \n Looking at material cost, there's not a big difference between 6 and 12 strands armored plenum rated OS1. This is a fairly small job, short runs (longest is 400 meters). So labor is going to be more expensive than materials by my estimate. Looking at bulk cabling, I also see pre-terminated MPO/MTP 12 strand cable. Paired with fiber tray cassettes that accept MPO and break out into six duplex LC connectors, it seems to make sense for a degree of future proofing. I can use the LC breakout in the short term, and the higher density MPO connection is there for the future. The cassette system also seems nice, I can change the breakout if needed, without having to splice anything new.\n What would the downside of 12 strand be over 6 strand? Is there a downside to MPO vs LC terminations on the cable itself. Is there a downside to a breakout cassette versus spliced terminations?\n    submitted by    /u/gordonthree  \n [link]   [comments]",
