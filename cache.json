These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber actors’ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.\nOT/ICS devices and designs are publicly available, often inco…",

I'm hoping you can give me some advice.\n In the past few years I transitioned from a chef, to an operations manager and sys admin of a commodity trading group. They had some unsecure and inefficient practices, like all users logging into a single email account. I'm sure you can all imagine some of the other things they came up with.\n Once hired I purchased a domain, and implemented messaging software. This business receives an enormous amount of email and I really enjoyed creating systems that helped them be more aware of what was happening.\n I don't anticipate leaving but I am planning on taking courses to help me stay in the field when I need to leave this company.\n Can anyone recommend meaningful courses I can take outside of a degree that could help further my career as a sys admin?\n ​\n Thank you!!!\n    submitted by    /u/QuiGonnJimm  \n [link]   [comments]",

Setting up servers, etc. I’ve always been SUPER into hardware (passion).\n But lately I’ve been setting up our new hosting servers for the company im at because they trusted me enough to move from managed hosting environment to rented servers where we manage the hosting ourselves.\n Most hosting clients are past clients where we made their sites. We host a few hundred but obviously want to increase.\n Im looking into collocation, but honestly I’m super surprised at the cost of servers. We are in South Africa so there aren’t many big DC providers. So only when we get a few servers would we look at collocation, but how “worth it” is hardware like Xeon CPU’s? I see there are now some new Intel consumer level CPUs that support ECC, and most new AMD CPUs support ECC. So for largely Wordpress and NodeJS environments is there an issue with going with AMD? Is there something I’m missing?\n Honestly I’m just not sure where to start with hardware, I’ve learnt what I can in theory, but real world reasons for certain choices, and advice is very different. \n This post was a bit of a ramble but I guess I’m just looking for any good nuggets from you pros 🙂\n    submitted by    /u/Jordz2203  \n [link]   [comments]",

In our environment (mostly server 2012 r2 and 2016) we have a server that is used by a third party company to run reports. For this they require local admin access. About 6 weeks ago, three of these accounts stopped being able to launch most apps, all except for windows accessories and office 365 apps (fat)\n These users are members of the local admins group, they are also part of an ad group that is also in local admins. Launching any other application gives the error ‘this operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer’\n These accounts are only a problem with this server, it’s the only one they would normally access\n I’ve cleared down the local accounts from there, including the registry. I’ve also just created the default app locker execution rules in group policy. These accounts have full unrestricted access to the server but still can’t launch other applications and services. Unfortunately this includes CMD, so even running a gpresult is proving difficult. Anyone had a similar issue?\n    submitted by    /u/jeggy111  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been asked to set up a network at this medium-sized church and I'm not quite sure what the best option is. The ISP installed a fiber connection to replace the preexisting DSL. They installed a Cisco 4300 series router and gave us a static IP to use. Because the router belongs to them I can't configure it in any way. It doesn't have DHCP set up so I have to manually set everything up. The church already had a cisco SG350-28P 28-Port Gigabit PoE Managed Switch that they had connected directly to the Cisco router.\n ​\n  \nI need to know if it is possible to use the managed switch for routing or if will i need to install another router. \n If I were to use the switch for routing what would that look like and would it pose security risks?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/-theflop-  \n [link]   [comments]",

Today our old DC's running dual ISP and using ASR1001-X with mem upgraded to 16G with full inet routes. So for each ISP we had an ASR and then peer the two ASR's. From there we had 3850X (Stack) setup as core with EIGRP taking the default route only. Idea was just get the traffic to one of the ASR's and BGP best path would kick in. Again for the most part it worked pretty well.\n But with us stepping it up to four ISP's the old design is just not going to work, we've seem to be maxing out the ASR1001-X with two full tables (which is maxed out at 16G) so this isn't going to work.\n So looking for a Edge router that can handle two to four full inet tables. For the core thinking we can just do what we did before as these 3850X should have zero issues with 4G maxed across all four ISP's or even 40G if all upgraded to 10G each.\n Or is there something else out we should be looking at for the core switches as well?\n ​\n Thanks in advance...\n    submitted by    /u/galluccib  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I wanted to post a question without getting into the entire topology of my network environment to get people's opinions and experiences of what you all have done. We have a network change/design opportunity and I am wanting to eliminate some route redistribution between OSPF and BGP. We use BGP for WAN routers to some of our sites around the state. We have remote connectivity from all around our state via our private fiber network, DMVPN tunnels (iWAN), and various peerings with Telco providers. We do this via 2 different data centers where we peer with different Telco routers via BGP, Cisco's iWAN, and our statewide aggregation routers that connect to our private fiber network across the state. The fiber network continues to grow as we lay more and more down each year. We bring those BGP routes into OSPF via route maps that have prefix lists attached to them. I wanted to go more into BGP and stop the route redistribution wherever I can. \n I am wondering if I should use BGP community values or route tags to allow our sites all around the state to determine what the best path to take would be. Basically every one of our remote locations have several methods of communication back to the data centers. I would like to make one path look better, and fail over, or be able to easily switch paths by changing a route map somewhere centrally to our data center. So if I change a value of a community string or route tag, all the sites switch paths at the same time, should I decide that needs to happen. Am I going down the right path here? Are route tags the best way to do this, or are community values the standard way to do this?\n    submitted by    /u/bardsleyb  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are running out of IP addresses at this location, and I was wanting to create a new SSID and put it on a different IP range so that users can connect devices to that network and work with their mobile devices and laptops.\n I have setup a VLAN for that the SSID in Unifi and created a new Scope in the DHCP server. I also set the firewall DHCP relay to point to the DHCP server so anything looking for those requests can find that IP range. \n I have setup something like this a few times in other devices using Unifi but in this current setup I am unfamiliar with Cisco and Sophos. I have figured a lot out by Googling and watching videos but I can’t seem to find this exact scenario that I am trying to recreate. \n I am wondering if I can just setup the DHCP scope, set the network inside of Unifi with the new IP range and point the DHCP relay to the firewall without using VLAN or if I need to use VLAN how I can get it to function properly across the network.\n Do I have to create a VLAN in the Sophos for this or do I just need to tag the firewall and point the DHCP relay back to the server? Also the switches are Layer 3 which I honestly have never used personally. I have been reading up about them but still unclear how I can utilize the layer 3 in this situation. \n I hope my post doesn’t get locked this time for being low quality.

          "description": "I am designing a hypothetical network for a homework assignment. It is fairly simple thus far, but this question I have is proving more difficult to answer than I expected. I have watched networking educational videos, I've looked for sources, but it seems that my firewall implementation idea is somehow novel, though I am certain it is not. Or, perhaps it is such a dumb idea that it does not exist online. \n I want to segment my network. Simple enough. My idea was to use firewalls at the edge of each network segment (\"star\" topology central router leads to firewalls at each outgoing port for the various departments) for high security. \n Is this... Reasonable? I only seem to find network segmenting that simply uses switches, but with no firewall other than that which leads to the WAN or DMZ. Additionally, how would these firewalls generally be configured? I would imagine I could allow only the ports that are reasonable for that segment's network usage?\n Also, can I use application proxy gateways at the edge of network segments? Online sources imply that proxies should only be used at the outside edge of the LAN. I want one proxy for one department, but a different proxy for another. Each then accessing the central router of the star topology. \n TL;DR can firewalls be reasonably used as a security measure for multiple internal network segments? What might that look like for security purposes? Same question for application proxy gateways?\n    submitted by    /u/CreedyBabyBoi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Service with asynchronous up/down speeds vs dedicated modems to each unit via cable provider.\n Both offers are priced similarly and have 5 year contract terms. (4-5% yearly increase in price) The microwave provider is everywhere wireless. They would deploy redundant equipment, backup power supplies, and service equipment. We own it after 7 years. Speeds are 500Mbps or 1 Gbps, but not higher at the moment.\n My question.. I'm not sure how to evaluate the microwave offering and if it will be superior to the cable modem in each unit. Latency/jitter, etc. What should we consider? I can ask one of their other recent deployments to test their system.\n From a risk perspective, the DOCSIS4 rollout will possibly drive down prices of cable offerings (at least introductory prices), and we'll be paying more in three years than we negotiate today.\n    submitted by    /u/techDad_312  \n [link]   [comments]",

In a blog post the creator, when talking about how croc works, explains:\n  \nThere are better ways than sequentially uploading and downloading. Instead, you can use a relay server to create a full-duplex real-time communication layer between the two computers so that “uploading” and “downloading” occur simultaneously between the two computers.\n  \nWhich in context sounds a lot like NAT hole punching.

          "description": "EDIT:UPDATE-my question was answered and pointed in a better direction. Turns out I should have probably posted in a industrial automation sub. Thanks for the info. \n Are there switches on the market that support RSTP with multiple rings in a switch. I am a design engineer for a BAS manufacturer and the industry is migrating out of rs485 twisted pair to using RSTP compatible switches with a Ring topology to keep costs low on the networking side. For example do switches allow you to set a root and backup port for multiple rings or are you limited to one failover port per switch. I imagine there are a wide range of options based on cost but this would be in the area of 3-5 rings per switch at most for very large networks. \n To clarify the end goal is to move into An IP friendly physical layer that maintains the cost effectiveness of daisy chains while using ring topology to give a fail over route if the cable is ever damaged/or enough nodes fail we exceed 100m between devices that are online. \n The current direction looks like a small 8 port industrial switch per network but I grow curious if there could be cost benefit to a single switch 18/24/48 port that could have multiple networks on 1.\n    submitted by    /u/Knoon1148  \n [link]   [comments]",
