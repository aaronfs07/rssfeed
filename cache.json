When I try to copy the files to a new location it often shows errors for files I am able to open. \n I desperatly need most (if not all) files on this hard drive (of course there is no fking backup, thanks to the prev sysadmin). Also the company won’t pay any money for a hard drive recovery service because some files are sensitive.\n My question is, would it solve my issues if I use a hard drive cloning device (will the files be corrupted even then?) , or shall I try some software like Acronis True Image?

We plan to put up some iPads with \"Guided Access\" (see https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/guided-access-ipada16d1374/ipados) in branch locations and a webpage where visitors can give feedback. Network is achieved by a data SIM in the iPad.\n This is all working good, but now we are looking for a way to remotely unlock the devices, update it to the last iOS version and lock it again. \n We looked at using an MDM like https://jumpcloud.com/ or a remote tool like TeamViewer, but so far we were not successful.

With the MSP dealing with a lot of the larger upgrades, projects, patching, auditing and improvement recommendations.\n The infrastructure is quite small, manageable and not too complex but with a lot of room and time to learn and progress personally. I'm just wondering what job title you would expect to see this as? Part of me thinks it should be IT manager since they'll be the only onsite IT responsibility. On the other hand a lot of it will be dealt with by the MSP and the tasks required wouldn't require a seasoned manager as the MSP will be a fall back, so it seems like a good role for someone somewhat experienced to step up in terms of responsibility.\n Just wondering what your thoughts and points are? I don't want to recommend hiring a SysAdmin and them falling out of depth, being underpaid for the job and unhappy but on the contrary, I don't want to tell my client to overspend on someone who is overqualified and would get bored.\n    submitted by    /u/xDroneytea  \n [link]   [comments]",

Beeing able to fact check them is always a good idea.\n Our reseller is pretty solid, so I doubt they'll do the \"get it wrong on purpose to sell more expensive packages\"... \n ​\n So starting October Windows Server can be licensed per virtual core. With a minimum of 8 virtual cores per VM.\n Question 1:\n When they say virtual cores do they really mean virtual \"cores\" or do they mean virtual threads. Basically can I have a vm with 16 threads assigned and only use a 8 core licenses?\n With physical cores it was actual cores. So our 2x16C server has 32 Cores and we needed 32 core licenses. But could use 64 threads as they are all multithreaded.\n ​\n Question 2:\n Are existing physical core licenses we have now automaticall virtual core licenses as well?\n We have 32 Core licenses. Which allowed us to run 2 windows servers maximum. If they are now virtual core licenses as well. We could theoretically run 4 windows servers with 8 cores each.\n ​\n Question 3:\n All client/device CALs need to be either subscription or with SA. is another prereq from what I gathered.\n Is that referring to windows server CALs only. Or exchange CALs as well. What about RDP CALs?\n Our windows server and exchange CALs have SA so we are good with those. But our RDP CALs do not.

It seems pretty full featured. It hasn't been maintained for over a year, and I haven't yet tested a restore.. But essentially the tool:\n 1) Connects to your tenant\n 2) Exports all the config into JSON\n 3) Organises that into folders\n 4) Puts it on any storage you can access\n I've tested the backup in my (very small) tenant, and it seems to work really, really well. \n There's full documentation for the module in the repo for further reading, just wanted to make people aware of it's existence.\n Remember; MS don't back any of this stuff up. If you made a mistake or some disgruntled, over privileged monkey trashes your environment the day they leave, they won't help you. Unlikely? Yes. Impossible? No. \n Personally, I'm going to setup some Azure storage and then automate the script to run once a week and export everything there. \n Hope someone finds this useful.

          "description": "So, as the title reads, in an update from a while back I updated to some stable build (I don't remember which one) of Windows 11. I then noticed that my task scheduler script wasn't working, I checked whether everything was set up correctly, but then I looked at the Event Viewer, and EventID 4688 for process creation events was nowhere to be found. I then went through the documentation which (at the time) didn't say anything about Windows 11 and then contacted Microsoft, got elevated, and the support told me the feature was no longer supported.\n Now, luckily I only use this event for triggering a launch script, which is relatively easy to do manually through a shortcut, but this is still pretty annoying.\n Other sysadmins use this event for more important stuff, like monitoring the usage of their devices for many different types of purposes.If you want to vote on this feature to return, upvote this post in the Feedback Hub.\n Edit: The story gets, weirder, a recent insider build said it fixed this issue, while support and the technical writers have said that the feature isn't supported. Something really strange must be happening in Redmond...\n    submitted by    /u/ErrorRaffyline0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So. I’ve managed to entrench myself at a small media company as their “tech support/IT/networking/anything nerdy” guy. Problem is a severe lack of understanding and appreciation about the entire field of IT and system support and I’m getting pretty “over it”. It’s a cobbled together network with no servers so nothing more than a UniFi router and switches and some APs, and most of my time is spent just doing tier 1 help desk crap and attempting to make some sort of sense of data management for a video production company that uses 30-60tb a quarter and wants all of it accessible at any time and doesn’t want to delete anything and also doesn’t understand why a production RAID isn’t a backup. \n I’ve digressed a bit because my ACTUAL question is: even as a very quick learner and problem solver, am I just dead in the water being so out of the loop on industry standard systems and practices? Once upon a time I was a student admin for the defense department in the late 90’s early 00’s so I’m very in the loop in a general way and have plenty of hoop-jumping experience having worked for DOD and dealt with about every major red tape hurdle you could think of for IT and dev teams given the GsA phonebooks of rules and restrictions, BUT I just get dejected looking at current posting when they list about 5-10 different things I’ve never dealt with in my life because there hasnt been a need in my current career path. So I guess what I’m asking is, am I just super behind and if so, is there a resource anyone could recommend for “learning what it is I need to learn about” if that makes sense? I am fully capable of learning a new skill or system very rapidly but I just don’t know where to begin after being left “unsupervised” for this long. Thanks all and be gentle, I’m an old nerd stepping out of a cave for the first time in a decade.\n    submitted by    /u/bigchinaaudio  \n [link]   [comments]",

No matter what I've tried it always authenticates with NTLM to the Gateway, whether I am on premise or at home using KDCProxy. I've scoured every post on the net I can find but there's no straight answer on this. I've tried the flags rdgiskdcproxy:i:1 (my KDCProxy is my Gateway) and that didn't work. I am running NLA but I don't want to turn that off as that offers protection. I'm aware that NTLM is the protocol that will never die at this point, but if there is a way to implement Kerberos I would love some assistance.

          "description": "Let me start this by saying this whole situation is utter hell, but it's a necessity.\n I have a server that came from a company we acquired. On this server, let's call it HV1, we have a HyperV installation with 2 DC's, an APP/RDS Server and a DB server (MS Access), and all of these servers are on Server 2012 R2. This host is sitting cold on the network and will never touch the wider internet. On the APP/RDS server is a proprietary software that was developed by the former company over the course of 15 years and there's no documentation. It talks to MS Access files on the DB server and there is a mapped drive to these files on the APP/RDS server. The software is loaded from the APP/RDS server and seems to be very tied into the domain with domain authentication and will not boot unless one of the two DCs is powered on. If the DCs are off, I get some SQL network errors saying the system cannot contact a DC to service the auth request. Boot them on, the software loads and asks for credentials.\n I now need to repurpose this G9 server and use it for production, which means I need to migrate this setup away from this host and onto an older server which can continue sitting cold for X time. Essentially, replicating the entire setup from one server to another, and the only difference being that I'll be moving it to VMware instead of using HyperV. Instant concern when I was asked for this was the domain controllers.\n I've done the initial backup & restore using Veeam, and I now have all of the servers sat on my new host. The problem of course is the domain and DCs - They aren't functional/working and that domain essentially is non-existent at the moment.\n Before I go any further, I want to have a think about the potential best ways to bring these DCs back to life, purely for the purpose of getting this application working again.\n Thoughts?\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/thisisrossonomous  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Unfortunately we're still very much learning how to use Endpoint Management with Azure, as the main business is still on prem. However, the \"side business\" uses exclusively Azure\n We don't have auto enrolment available to use, and are relying on users logging in on the new laptop. The problem then is that the user becomes local admin, which is bad. The solution to this has been to create an entry in user account protection that sets the only admins as \"administrator\" (local admin) and a special pcadmin account we created on Azure AD. To my understanding, this is fine\n The issue we have though, is if we need to support a user remotely, we can't elevate privileges in Bomgar (BeyondTrust) using the Azure account, it only seems to support local user accounts. This hasn't been a problem as we were with the users logging into their laptops, so we could set the admin password at the machine, but the case has arisen where I need to do something on a laptop which was bought and remains in another country\n I was hoping I could, as a temporary workaround, add a PS script to enable and set the local admin password, but either it's not working or the laptop just won't sync, because it's not made a difference\n Is there a solution to my problem, or do I need to take a few steps back and make some bigger changes to our system (other than auto-enrolment)\n ​\n Bonus question - my employer will pay for training courses. Is there a recommended one I can go on for Enpoint Manager/Intune?

It could be AD, Exchange, windows server, etc. It was slow, but as long as your persisted, you would eventually get to someone that could fix your issue.\n In the last few years though, something has changed. I get passed between queues. I get told to make changes that take services offline.

He'd kept the IT dept running on a small budget while putting in the overtime and working weird hours to patch things outside of business time. He made no bones about being overworked but it was obvious he wasn't going anywhere since he'd been there for so long (at least, that's what I had assumed given his long tenure with the company - 15+ years).\n Requests for a larger budget to replace equipment and grow the IT department were universally rejected. There has only been one exception recently which was the addition of my position to the IT team. Apparently this is something my boss had been pushing for years since the company is doing really well and expanding across the board. \n 8 or 9 weeks ago some shit hit the fan, one of the higher ups spoke to my overworked boss in a way that definitely was not well received. All of this revolved around a situation that I'm sure could have been avoided with properly scaling IT to the company's growth. My boss put in his 2 week notice on the spot.\n Fast forward to today - servers are down and multiple services and network storage drives are inaccessible. There are 3 of us at the help desk with no clue how to fix it. There are plenty applicants and interviews to fill the position but I can only assume the salary offers are too low since none of the people who come through are ever heard from again.\n A large part of the company is dead in the water today.

(and feels good for a change of pace.)\n I was thinking about the 8 companies I've worked at over the past 22 years other than the super small companies with 1 or 2 people in the whole IT department every place I've worked at has so many wasted hours. \n I've hired on at more than one place where they are going on about being swamped and then it's two weeks before I even get a laptop and spend half the day chatting with everyone or listening to them complain about policies. \n Then in every place with a team of people, there have always one or two superstars and the rest are just there either doing busy work or not really doing anything. \n Next are all the meetings, the bigger the company the more you have, and the more you just get invited to for no reason other than you replied to an email one time. Of course, there are always people who just love to take advantage of this rather than get work done. \n I've been on both sides of it too. I worked at one place in the early 2000s where I spent six months going to quiet rooms in the building and spending the day playing Civilization V without anyone noticing or caring. I've also been the superstar who's spent a solid 30-40 hours a week getting something done. \n This is just my opinion but overall from what I've seen in corporate America the next major recession we are going to see job reductions in IT similar to what happened to manufacturing jobs in 2008.

Basically, as of now, users submit requests for new softwares to the helpdesk, and then they ask my team to review the software prior to allowing it to be installed. The only issue with this current process is that, I have exactly zero idea how other medium sized enterprises validate software. My question is two fold.\n ​\n Firstly, what information do you request from the users when they ask for a new software to be introduced to the environment. So far this is the list i've come up with.\n  \n1. Is there existing software that can be used\n 2. Business need for software\n 3. Is this for a project\n 4. What is the impact if this software is not approved\n 5. What specific task will get done using this software.\n  \nSecondly, how do you know if the software is safe to introduce? Right now, here is what I do..\n  \nRun the software installer through our EDR sandbox\n Check if the installation is signed\n Try installing the software on a test box\n Googling the software / the hash\n  \nThe only issue with my current method is that a lot of times our engineers find these really niche tools from github etc that do extremely specific things. I don't have a good way of validating any of these as I can't read through the code and understand what they do in a timely fashion. That would take me several days / weeks if I did that for every software. Any advice would be great!\n    submitted by    /u/ATH1RSTYM00SE  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all, recently purchased a refurb DL380 Gen9 with the NVMe enablement kit (part no 774741-B21 which consists of a PCIe NVMe controller, drive cage with backplane and 3 PCI express cables). I installed 6 x Kingston DC1500M drives (firmware version S67F0103, no newer available) and whilst they all work, I can only get PCI express Gen 3 link speed on port 1 & 2 of the controller. The other 4 drives (port 3, 4, 5 and 6) only operate at Gen 1 link speed.\n Output in lspci with correct speed (port 1 & 2):\n  LnkSta: Speed 8GT/s (ok), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- \n Output in lspci with slower speed (port 3, 4, 5, 6):\n  LnkSta: Speed 2.5GT/s (downgraded), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- \n Things I tried:\n  \nReset BIOS: no change. There are also no options to configure link speeds.\n Move drives around: no change. It doesn't matter which drive is connected where, port 1 & 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the other run at Gen 1\n Move cables around: no change\n Swap cable connections: connected port 1 & 2 to port 5 & 6 on the backplane. Still only port 1 & 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the the other run at Gen 1. That rules out a backplane problem\n Swapped NVMe controller: no change\n Connect only port 5 & 6: runs at Gen 3\n Firmware upgrade of NVMe controller: was already at latest version 1.78\n All other firmware is up to date\n  \nSo it looks like in whatever combination, I can only get 2 of the 6 drives to run at full Gen 3 speed whilst the other downgrade to Gen 1. There are some jumpers on the NVMe controller but I can't find any documentation on what they do and I doubt it's going to make a difference anway. Needless to say this quite kneecaps the performance of the NVMe drives... Anything else I can try?\n    submitted by    /u/RedShift9  \n [link]   [comments]",

And we've got a few different iterations of devices even within the same modell (Gen1, Gen2, ..) so it isn't entirely clear to us which devices support eSIM or not.\n Scanning for regular broadband internet capability is easy enough:\n  \nnetsh mbn show interfaces\n  \nAnd even getting information about regular SIM cards is no problem:\n  \nnetsh mbn show read interface=*\n  \nBut I can't find an easy way to figure out whether a device supports eSIM or not.\n Reading https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/esim-device-configuration and https://www.petervanderwoude.nl/post/configuring-esim-profiles-on-windows-devices/ lead me to believe that I somehow should be able to get at least the ICCID somehow. But the first netsh command above only returns the regular broadband adapter with no hint whether the device supports eSIM or not.\n Further reading brought me to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/mb-esim-operations and the \"Hardware Lab Kit\" test from Microsoft which is supposed to feature a \"netsh mbn test feature=esim\" test but ... this feels way out of scope (settings up a HLK server and whatnot) for something that ... I feel should be a lot simpler.\n The only way I've found so far is manually checking the broadband settings GUI of the settings app for the availability of eSIM profiles.

I'll try to explain it as best as I can.\n We are providing our users with Dell Latitute computers. At the moment we have anything from 7490 to 7430, and somewhere around 5320/7420 the problems started to arise.\n We issue our users with Jabra Evolve2 65 headsets so they can participate in Skype for Business meetings (we are not allowed to use Teams, don't ask...). It all seems to be working well, until after a week or two when the users who have been issued with a new computer comes back and complains that Skype is crashing when they use the headset. If they connect the USB dongle whatever sound settings you open (be it Skype or Windows), will freeze the program. \n I thought it was just a simple problem with Jabra, but after testing more thoroughly it turns out the problems are there for any USB sound dongle from any brand. We've tried updating the Realtek driver, and that works but only for a while once again, or just makes the Sound settings incredibly slow to navigate, not entirely frozen. Its also not universal which computers work decently with new drivers, and which will still not work.\n The problem is now big enough we can't decide on new headsets to buy, because we simply don't know if we can make them work.

Now, I the computer science teacher became the sysadmin of the school where I teach and I should get them in shape. Now Ubuntu and Windows 10 Pro are installed and every PC has one user with admin rights (yikes!). I would like to change this.\n I have a general idea and I know that I'm capable of hacking something together but I would like to do it in a proper way, e.g. in a way which probably requires me to put in more effort in the beginning but it should then spare me headaches in the future.\n My idea in general is the following: Students should learn how to (de)install apps, use said apps + MS Office + webbrowsing, get to know the OS-s (Windows 10 Pro and Ubuntu), learn the basics of fotoshop, do some programming in Python and execute them in the command line. On the other hand, it would be nice if let's say after midnight every PC would return to its original state which would prevent the students to do nasty stuff. The student would need to store everything in the cloud of on a USB-stick. The cherry on the pie would be the fact that the PC-s update themselves whenever needed. I'm thinking about maybe even creating a user for every student?

I'd like to have a group policy so nobody can't update windows or better. That no one is able to choose that option.\n I don't know if it sounds like very difficult or if there's way to deactivate for a group.\n Thanks alot in advance.\n I've been learning a lot the couple of month and I think with the redditors and community I feel motivated and please keep learning and sharing. =)\n    submitted by    /u/MecojoaXavier  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there fellow Sysadmins!\n I‘d like to have some advice on a migration/integration topic:\n I was tasked to plan the integration of the infrastructure of another company into mine.\n Both infrastructures contain an Active Directory and Azure Environment as well as Intune/Endpoint manager.\n Needless to say that I’ve never done that before – and my knowledge of Active Directory stems from my apprenticeship which was many years ago. In the meantime, I’ve worked with an IAM solution like Okta. \n While the way the new accounts are created follow a fully automatic process,\n I wonder if there is an “easy” way to migrate all mailboxes, teams, groups, and MDM devices. All I found were guides that seem to include a huge amount of manual work – or deeper knowledge of PowerShell. There solutions might turn out to be frictionless and not that hard, but I cannot evaluate that based on my knowledge/experience.\n So, I see two ways to solve that problem:\n 1) Get into the PowerShell Scrips to automate parts of the progress\n 2) Search for a full featured migration tool that handles the work for me\n For the second point – of course it will be less effort, but my main concern on that topic is time. It must be done as soon as possible. \n I am looking forward to getting some new insides into this.\n Thanks in advance for every advice\n    submitted by    /u/GnuDzt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I went out to work on a VPN connection issue the other day and noticed something extremely badly configured. I suspect the reason we're having so many issues is that the clients' LAN is on a 192.168.1.x/24 subnet...the most common subnet ISP routers provide.\n I'm fairly new here, but I looked around the firewall and found a ton of NAT rules that are basically trying to get around this problem of \"What happens when you're on 192.168.1.x and you try to connect via SSL VPN to LAN that is also 192.168.1.x so you can RDP into a machine \" \n Obviously, this is a bad configuration I think what needs to happen is that network needs to be on VLAN with a more corporate-friendly subnet(172.x.x.x or 10.x.x.x) but I honestly don't know where to start. No one's going to fix it without a nudge, or they might do something nutty like I've seen already and just make an interface with a 172.x.x.x IP on the firewall and NAT *Everything* through that.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I got a question but I feel like I first have to explain the background a little bit: I have a customer with very specific requests. They need a system of 4 client and 2 server machines (will all be Windows 11 / Windows Server 2022) together with some additional network hardware (NAS, printers). The special thing is that this small network will run completely isolated and will not be connected to WAN or any other networks (for a fact I'm planning on physically plugging non used LAN ports on all devices). They need an AD running but only with generic users (Factory User, Storage User and so on) and no personal users. One of the servers will function as a Domain Controller. And They need that exact same system running on several different sites across the country. Like it has to be exactly the same, down to every single AD user.\n So since the the setup will be identical on all sites and not connected to the outside whatsoever, I had the idea to set this up in my lab one time, configure it to the customers likes and then just take images from every machine. If then the order for a site arrives, I could just use my specific images to prepare the machines. I've done it like that before but never with an AD involved, hence my questions. Oh and we use Symantec Ghost for imaging, if that matters. So here my questions:\n  \nCan you think of anything arguing against cloning AD machines, for example a Domain Controller?\n When I clone all machines after they are added to the AD and then restore these images on other machines, will they be added properly to the new site's AD (since the hostnames get cloned as well) or will this be spotty? I could join them to the AD manually for each site if need be, but it would increase the workload.\n Overall thoughts / input on my plan?\n  \nThanks in advance and have a nice week.\n    submitted by    /u/-sbl-  \n [link]   [comments]",

They all are “build in” the walls. Recessed about 30cm and welded directly to metal construction of the building.\n Replacing them would be extremely difficult and expensive and would include painting all 4 offices…\n So my “standard” setup for each of them is\n 24 port patch panel for fiber\n 48 port patch panel for CCTV\n Two or three 48 port patch panels for regular network jacks \n Aggregation switch for fiber that’s linking all 4 buildings and for all others switches from the cabinet\n Separate cctv switch that has its own fiber uplink to the main server room \n Two or three switches for regular network \n 2U NVR for CCTV\n 2U UPS also for CCTV\n it’s minimum of 12 and in the biggest building 14U\n Just writing that I realized that I could move all NVRs to the main server room, I don’t like having all eggs in one basket but that is kind of not much of a choice situation. But this is still at best 1U or 2U above my rack size.\n In all of that “desperation” I started thinking that maybe I could somehow secure UPS outside, to the bottom of the rack cabinet?

Same cluster, upgraded in-place. Earlier versions were a touch rocky to do major version upgrades on, but documentation was there, and I was able to get it sorted.\n Over the decade I've not only had performance improvements on the same hardware, but new features, and all sorts of great things. I update with some regularity (several times per year).\n I went to take a backup of my VM and found a feature suddenly there that I didn't know I needed. \"Protected\". I can take backups that don't get auto-pruned by my backup task! SO AWESOME!\n Also, Proxmox VE gave me an HTML5 local console to my VMs months/years before VMWare even had it, and Proxmox VE did it so much better (so much more responsive).\n And these are just some examples.\n So, I gotta say, fuckin'eh to the Proxmox VE devs!

          "description": "Hey guys and gals. Anyone having any issues creating a Windows 11 Enterprise image for deployment? (yeah we still use actual images for some reason)\n We are currently prepping our first windows 11 image for rollout via Desktop Central and are having a ton of random issues.\n After deployment the OS will not open a ton of apps (no errors and no processes start) including settings, paint, ms store, notepad to name a few. This seems to be happening across any hardware we try it on. If I try to run settings via task manager I get an 'this app is not installed' prompt. \n I've ran SFC, DISM, with no errors found / no improvement. I can't really get to much else to try to repair the install/apps either (settings is completely dead).\n It is worth noting that the current windows 11 version we have been testing with is Enterprise 22H2. We have tried fresh installs of 22H2, upgrading from windows 10 to windows 11 and running updates, as well as updating from 21H1 to 22H2. Due to the nature of the business/our security policy we can't deploy anything below the latest MS patched device even if the latest version is unstable (yeah idk).\n Any ideas/comments?\n ​\n TLDR: Does Windows 11 Suck or do I just suck? inb4 both.\n    submitted by    /u/Cyning90025  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'll try to make this short. Started my career in IT last November when I started working as an IT field technician for a telecom company. Things were good at first but having to drive around didn't cities to provide support for 30+ sites got old even though my schedule was pretty flexible with no one to directly report to in my immediate coverage area.\n Got tired of being away from home and felt like I also hit a ceiling as far as knowledge goes. The position focused very much on hardware over software and didn't feel like I could further advance my career by staying at current company.\n Fast forward to November 1st this year. I started a new position with a different company that has more of a focus on Windows products ( Windows Server, Office products, etc). The previous IT guy they had at the company unfortunately passed away back in June from cancer. With that he also left no documentation whatsoever when it came to passwords, credentials, anything for that matter. \n Now I'm dealing with a Windows Server that is currently running on an evaluation version because they were attacked by Ransomware back in September which caused them to restore their server without a license I guess? They are also using a combination of Google docs and Office 2016.\n I've already bright these items up to the CFO who is my direct report and I don't think he understands the sense of urgency to have these items implemented\n    submitted by    /u/Latter-Adeptness4156  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm an Architecture / Engineering manager, in prior lives I've been in development, ops, infrastructure, data center, all at the same company. It's a really big environment, and I've gotten a reputation for understanding how most of it fits together.\n I've been a manager for about 3 years now, finally feel like I know what I'm doing, but mostly with a small team. I'm probably too hands on/ in the weeds, and I like to work on side projects still, but I get good feedback from my team, and boss/ peers. My team's going to double in a few weeks, and I've been a bit worried about coming off as a know-it-all, or a micromanager to the new folks. I try to be cognizant of setting a goal and letting the team figure out the best way to get there, but I definitely have opinions about how we should be building things.\n So, I guess my question is how do you prefer to interact with your boss, when they're not just the people manager? Do you like having them help figure things out, or would you rather they stay out of your way and let you come to them? Or those of you that are in this situation, how do you balance it?\n Hope that didn't come across too self centered, thanks for the consideration\n    submitted by    /u/sandaz13  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm looking for some level of understanding with Cisco Hyperflex. We will hopefully getting official training on it soon, but my team is being asked to take over a multi-site Hyperflex solution that was created by, well lets just call them non-IT people to be nice, and my first impression is that it wasn't built right. But they insist they followed all the Cisco recommendations. So I have some questions I'm hoping to figure out before I get called at 3am on a Saturday.\n First, the way these systems are configured is there is 6 VMware hosts, all with 6 SSDs in them, then the 7th server is the Hyperflex management server or something. Each server has a single NIC with 2 ports, 25Gbit, connected to two different switches. Those NICs are handling anything Hyperflex, VMware DRS, VMware Management, storage, and VM traffic itself. \n Questions:\n 1 - I've always gone with the school of thought that 1 single dual port NIC isn't very good for redundancy, but they insist this is the Cisco recommendation, are they really right?\n 2 - I also would never shove everything through those two nics, is this also Cisco's recommendation?\n 3 - The storage in VMware looks like iSCSI, but I haven't been able to get hands on. Where does the iSCSI adapters on the VMware host connect to as a SAN provider? Is it the management server? What happens when it crashes?\n 4 - Is the Hyperflex storage like VSAN where there is a replication delay? if so, how long is that delay?\n 5 - They told me DRS should be turned off for Hyperflex. Is that true? IF so, why?\n I guess open ended, is there any other tidbits of info you can supply me? Imagine that you are being asked to support a pair of these systems in different geographic locations, without ever seeing the damn thing ever.\n That's me\n    submitted by    /u/ntengineer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Today I upgraded a JIRA app called BigPicture on our productive environment. I'm not a professional JIRA admin, but I do 1st and 2nd Level Support aside from my main tasks.\n The company paid around 6500 $ for the license for that app.\n By default, the app creates a database dump whenever you upgrade it.\n Cool, I thought. Upgraded it with few clicks. Closed the ticket – went on with my day thinking that it worked out fine. Nope. I received an E-Mail that the entire configuration from the users was gone.\n I looked into it and, yes, all the things that they were working on were gone. Communicated the situation to my other admin colleague and to the key users. Then I tried restoring the data from the database dump. This did not work because the database scheme has been upgraded as well, and we would have to revert the app to the older version to make the restore file compatible.\n So, I went into test environment, downloaded the older version of said app, installed it, but no. It did not downgrade. Apparently you'd have to uninstall the app first and then reinstall the older version. Sure thing, so I did just that (on the test environment) and tried to restore the backup there. Failed. Nothing happened when I click on the button to restore the data. And I also cannot restore the data on the test environment as the database dump only applies to the prod environment (due to the upgrade).\n Note that this is not the first time that this happened. We've had the same issue with this app around 1 month ago, where I created a ticket. Apparently it was a bug, which then got hotfixed. (We even tested it and it worked). But now we are back to where we've been in the beginning. I reopened the ticket, and I'm still waiting for feedback.\n Got a message that this issue has been perceived very negatively, and I understand. Now they want me to get the app working ASAP or I might get fired, but there's not much I can do.\n Yikes.\n    submitted by    /u/godsknowledge  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are replacing the old DCs in our organisation for cyber security which has made us create new print servers. All the printers are installed and work from the servers in the configuration we want, using dns for port names etc.\n Now because of print nightmare we are trying a work around to install the printer drivers via intune and then a login script to map the printers after the drivers are installed.\n Here comes the issue, we have noticed that all of the printers with v4 drivers are being installed with MS point and print driver. The printer with v3 drivers are installing with their appropriate drivers.\n We have found that some of the V4 drivers are not installing, so adding that to the driver install script, removing and re-running the login mapping script, it still adds the printers with point and print. 2 of these are for the main office and need user preferences enabled so they can select trays etc. But point and print doesn't enable that. Without that we cannot shut off the old DCs.\n Now we don't want to disable the print nightmare registry key or amend it to a state where it is not 1 as this will be picked up in the cyber security audit in March 2023. I am at a loss as to what I can do to bypass this issue. It seems odd that all websites on the Internet state V4 is the answer to fixing it but V4 is causing the problem.\n At the moment we cannot move to a driverless system as we need to get new printer contracts first.\n TLDR; printers with V4 drivers are shown installed with point and print and is not suitable for our environment.\n    submitted by    /u/DarthEmu  \n [link]   [comments]",

(She really didn't want to put them on the network) This way at least i can look into the backups to see what has changed. But even that doesn't prove anything.\n What would you do so you could \"prove\" that either she changed something or at least see what changed and by whom ?\n This person can tie you up for hours and days complaining we don't do enough to find the culprit on her work pc and i don't know anymore what i could do to help her.\n ​\n Cheers,\n    submitted by    /u/_Aerish_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am wondering if there is also a 3rd party provider that can link to various identity providers to be the single source of identity so we can then point SSO/Saml config from the various saas provders instead of azure.\n A comment has been made, that they want to keep out tenant as clean as possible, eg only users with licenses and have access to company resources and equipment to reduce risk. This will likely be 300 users in next few years. But overall staff could be 5000+. Of the 5000+ , they wont have email acct, nor equipment but do need access to like HR Saas portals etc.\n Personally, I think its going to be cheaper to just give everyone a basic 365 license that inc some form of email and can control the MFA part of the identity provider. But business wants alternatives as they know as soon as I enable email, I will be going, headocount, headcount (not that I said I can turn the email part off).\n I am thinking like of Okta etc but wanted ot ask here first.\n    submitted by    /u/slewis_1972  \n [link]   [comments]",

(The VPN client has to swap gateways on its own as I don't trust my users to toggle to the back up, and to toggle back to the primary when connection is stable again.) \n I'm hesitant at the Cisco option as I don't have much Cisco CLI expertise.\n We have about 25-35 VPN endpoints at any given time. \n We are a full windows org and only IT uses VPN on phones (mainly to just test if the VPN connection is working)\n    submitted by    /u/BOF007  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since i’m relying on Aruba to host my customer websites and email server (talking about imap/pop ofc), i would like to move to a vps to increase the income and to simplify my management work. I started looking at OVH but i need a “lot” of storage because my customers want a lot of GB per email address and on OVH to obtain more than 160gb i need to pay for the 8core/8gb ram vps that i don’t need (i can’t consider the option to add a secondary partition because cpanel can’t officially store email on another partition). So i started looking at A2Hosting, the “Lift 16 Vps” makes more sense for me since it has 450gb storage so i can fulfill the customer needings about email capacity. The exchange server is not a viable option due to costs. I would like to hear opinions about a2hosting, if someone has better ideas than mine and if cpanel has some sort of problems on multi-hosting that i didn’t consider.

          "description": "Anyone else or just me? The amount of trouble and drama that these cause me is unreal at times. Absolutely hate the things!\n In an environment where your place cannot ship goods without the printed labels, it is a bit of a showstopper!\n We use Zebra printers at site, quite a number of them, printing various labels from SAP, so they often have to be specific printers for each label type. These are types such as 110Xi4's, 220Xi4's, ZD500's and ZT610's. \n A long while back, I made some suggestions around purchasing maintenance for them but this cost and idea wasn't being entertained. So at the time, looked at purchase a spare of each printer type so in the event of failure, we can roll out a new printer immediately, minimising disruption and downtime. We went with this idea and knowing it could be months before replacement printer would arrive as lead times are about 3 months now. Obviously this was long ago now and spare is in use. \n So today, printer seems to have a mechanical fault, is out of warranty and Zebra don't really want to know. I'd sent them a video displaying fault and they now recognise it as being mechanical fault and needs a visit, but they ask me to contact a partner for this!\n Being the only IT guy about the place, this ultimately falls to me. I'm an IT guy yes, but I am not a printer engineer. We have our limits but it doesn't half stress me out when these things go down.\n It honestly felt as though I was doing same thing over and over again with the printer and expecting a different result. I also find printers the most mundane sort of things to be dealing with which I suppose doesn't help!\n    submitted by    /u/phoenix_73  \n [link]   [comments]",

I posted here because I keep getting put in situations of having to deal first hand with termed employees.

Fortunately all together the total amount of data being used is just a bit over 1 TB and we have Offsite backups running. Client doesn't know this yet. \n I want to look into getting a hard RAID Controller for the server and get RAID setup. Should I go for a RAID 5 and move the DATA off the D: Drive to the unused Disk on DISK 5? Or setup the server to do have a RAID 10 configuration for the DATA Drive?\n Also it bothers me that the OS is just sitting on a single drive with no redundancy as well.

We recently won a contract to distribute specialized network switches nationally but the catch is that we now directly take over the warranties and our current system is not suitable for the now large amount of RMAs we have to process and track. I have been asked to evaluate Snipe-IT as an alternative system before we spend a small fortune developing new Asset Management Software.\n I have played around with the demo and while It will easily address most of our needs the only way I can see us using it to track assets that have come back for an RMA is by creating a new status or duplicating a location and adding a suffix (example, having \"Location A\" and \"Location A-RMA area\"). However, due to their high volume, we want to treat the faulty switches as an entirely separate beast, in order to make end of month reporting easier.\n    submitted by    /u/Hugs_Happy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The backend is serving HTTP on 9801 but is also serving websockets on port 3000. A user visiting the site enters the domain https://foo.com, gets taken to the varnish box and views the site, where the site javascript then tells it to connect to websockets on wss://foo.tld:3000, but it can't connect. There are lots of solutions for setups where varnish is running on the same localhost as the backend that it's serving, but this one seems to be a problem. My VCL includes the standard req.http.upgrade -> return pipe with the connect headers copied, and it worked with our previous frontend proxy that was on a different CDN, and I suspect the old CDN was playing a part in making the websocket connections work.\n How do I get varnish to pick up the client connection for WSS on 3000 and pass it transparently back and forth to a remote backend that is running WS also on 3000?

I'm making a completely fresh AD/AAD environment for fun, trying to mirror our current hybrid environment, and want to make sure I do it as cleanly and future-proofed as possible. It's going to be my personal test environment, I'm hoping it can save me some trouble in the future since half the time there seems to be some little bug or security hardening that sneaks through unnoticed (or undocumented) for monthly patching. Plus it's a fun project in general, I always end up taking jobs where it's all set up already, never got to try making my own environment fully from scratch.

They've been pretty lacking in pay raises and bonuses though, and when a former colleague set me up with an interview, I took it - my first interview in 10 years.\n It went well, and they made me an offer which is nearly 35% above my current salary. Obviously it's an incredible offer, and I'm delighted to get it. My boss says that he wants to make me a similar offer, but it's going through the quagmire of the company HR department and nothing concrete has materialised after about a week. The new company needs to know by the end of this week whether I'm accepting.\n Not counting new job fear (in which I hope I'm not alone, and everyone here has from time to time!), the big thing for me is that company policy says I'd need to be in the office at least 2 days a week. I currently do the majority of drop offs and pick ups for my little girl (who's 3), which is possible due to my WFH schedule. The commute to the new job would be about 40 minutes each way, so days that I worked, I wouldn't be able to do the nursery run.\n My new prospective boss says that in his team, he's super open to being flexible with WFH, so it may not even be this much. I'm just.... Hesitant. I know that it's because of my WFH lifestyle that I'm used to - I guess I'm just wondering, how do I get over this fear?

We have an old one and are talking about replacing it the first of the year so I don't want to spend too much time there.

          "description": "This is a self-serving post where I am patting my own back, but I don't care. I'm happy.\n We rate people on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest. Once a manager rates their employees, they need to justify the rating to senior management, who almost always challenge the rating, especially when it's a 4 or a 5. So, my manager is meeting with senior management and tells them he's giving me a 5, and they just say \"We're good with that. Who's next.\"\n After that, he tells me what an outstanding job I do. How my troubleshooting skills are god-tier, at times. How somehow I seem to be available 24x7, and on and on.\n Honestly, I don't think I am all that exceptional. I MIGHT spend 15-20 minutes after hours responding to emails from people. And I usually stay VPNed in till the VPN times out at 8:00 PM and kicks me off. If someone needs something done and it takes 5 minutes, I just go do it, because I am already VPNed in and I don't want to deal with it in the morning.\n So, in a month, I don't work that much overtime. But when I am sitting in bed and watching something on my iPad and I see an email pop up where someone is asking for something simple, I'll just reply and tell them I can deal with it in the morning.\n So, this really is the ILLUSION of putting in an insane amount of after hours work. When it's really just me responding to an email now and then. As an old boss told me: carry your Blackberry on you at all times (this was the 2000s). 99% of the time, you'll never be bothered. But that one time someone calls you and you answer, you're everyone's hero. And they'll remember you're the guy who answered the phone when there was a problem.\n It's good to be recognized sometimes.\n    submitted by    /u/plazman30  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been doing this for roughly 10 years. \n Now I understand while the market is pretty good for IT jobs at the moment, I can't seem to get over the fact, that all these high level engineering questions get thrown at you, or something that is super specific to the business. Half the time it's not even listed on the job advert and here I am thinking yep, a suitable sysadmin role only to be thrown curveball after curveball of things non related to original advert, or what's listed on my resumé.\n Does anyone else experience these sorts of things in the application process and what sort of questions should I expect tomorrow?

          "description": "I know what some might say right away, imposter syndrome, etc, and there might be some of that.\n But in other real ways I’m not good enough at my job and it’s hurting me, hurting the clients, and hurting the customers.\n There’s really two problems: one is that I’m tech-savvy and have a real knack for this stuff, but past a certain level of technical difficulty and outside of a certain level of emergency I lose focus and falter in knowledge. Like, if the server is down right now, I can figure outa way to get it back up. I might not be able to articulate how, but I’ll get it running again. But ask me to troubleshoot what happened after the fact and I’ll flounder. Similarly if you give me a bunch of machines and an end result, I can get them running… but are they configured correctly, or do they just “kinda work”?\n The second is I really have a hard time working hard enough or doing the work I need to be doing. If I don’t have a person calling now, I try to go to my ticket queue, and I can sit and stare at tickets or click in and out of them multiple times without doing anything. And that’s if I don’t give in to the temptation do something else entirely. I’ve blocked Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook on work computers during the day, and it helps, but I can still find ways to not do work. I have things that sit in a queue for days or weeks because I get so anxious I avoid them until I can’t any longer.\n I’m failing the rest of my team, and I feel like shit all the time about it. And that just makes it worse.\n I think about jumping ship to another job, but I actually like the company and people I work for, and I know it would only help for six months to a year, and I’d be right back where I started.\n I don’t know, this may not be the place to talk about this, this is less a technical conversation than maybe mental health mixed with discipline, but maybe some of you have some advice to help me get back on track.\n    submitted by    /u/Essex626  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was using explorer patcher to move my taskbar to top successfully before 22H2. But yesterday my computer got updated and the taskbar went back down. So, I tried a bunch of stuff until I managed to get it back on top and, as I found this instruction nowhere, I share here in case someone needs it.\n The difference between this solution and the regular instruction I found around the internet is that they all suggest editing values of a \"MMStuckRects3\" key, which was working for me before 22H2, but not anymore. The hack is to add a new REG_BINARY to the registry key below (create if does not exist):\n [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\MMStuckRectsLegacy]\n The name of this new value must be the device instance path (second property when navigating to Devices Manager > Monitors > (target monitor name) > Properties > Device Instance Path). Get everything after \"DISPLAY\\\" and replace the other \"\\\" by \"#\", such as:\n  \nDevice Instance Path: DISPLAY\\PHLC056\\5&3C07B47&0&UID266\n Registry key name: PHLC056#5&3c07b47&0&UID266 (letters in lower case between # and &UID)\n  \nUsing this as the name of the value, enter the following binary value:\n 30 00 00 00 fe ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 3e 00 00 00 28 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 60 00 00 00 01 00 00 00\n Restart explorer.exe or sign out/in and the second monitor taskbar should be at the top.\n Hope it helps!\n    submitted by    /u/Dramatic-Top608  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can generally replicate it by going File -> Open, open any file, then go File -> Save As and immediately I get the dialog box with the above message. Once it resolves (after up to a minute) and the document saves it doesn't occur again for a period of time. To me that smacks of DNS but I can resolve the share via Windows Explorer or by doing an nslookup at any time before or after opening and saving and it resolves with no issues.\n Environment is Windows Server 2019 on premises Active Directory running two DCs in Hyper-V VMs on two different physical hosts. I'm running DFS Namespace with both DCs listed under Namespace servers. Less than 50 clients. Clients are all Windows 10 with two Windows 11 machines connected via either wireless or gigabit ethernet. Addresses are assigned via DHCP and both DCs are the only DNS servers assigned. Office applications range from 2016 to 365.\n It must be DNS (even when it isn't lol) but I confess I'm not sure where to go from where or how else to troubleshoot. If you can access a share immediately via Windows Explorer, or have nslookup return an immediate correct result, what else is left?

We deployed a new Update to our Check Point VPN Client on ~ 100 devices. On a minority of the devices, the updated caused to kill the device's connectivity completely. The WiFi Adapter still shows networks it can (and also can connect to them) but then reports \"No Internet access\".\n An \"ipconfig\" reveals what's going on: it shows nothing at all. It seems like Windows lost track of it's adapters.\n Unfortunately, uninstalling networking devices does not do anything. Manually installing the Ethernet and/or the WiFi driver doesn't resolve it either. The only solution we had until now was to completely reinstall Windows.\n Additionally, the Event Log does not show anything relevant to find the actual cause neither.\n ​\n Has anyone else had this issue and might know a solution that does not include calling the user to the office for a reinstallation?\n    submitted by    /u/Th1sD0t  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since the server is in a remote location space is limited.

This is just a hey if we lose a lot of data lets see if we can restore here before we send in an order to recall data. \n Obviously if you have any links (and yes ebay included) that would be great. Ideally we are looking for new pcie raid cards that can connect sata disks. Refurb units will be fine but we are looking for at least some sort of warranty to replace the card within a year if something were to happen.\n ​\n I was also thinking of getting this from newegg\n https://www.newegg.com/p/14G-0006-001G5?quicklink=true\n And passing the card in to the freenas VM itself.\n    submitted by    /u/eagle6705  \n [link]   [comments]",

A degree. \n So that brings me to my question for you guys, if you have a degree, when did you get yours? I’m only 23 myself and kind of figure there’s no reason I shouldn’t just do it, and I was looking and a lot of the courses for an Associates in Cloud Architecting are for certs I already have, so I would think it would be a cakewalk.\n    submitted by    /u/KeredEkralc  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think the DAYTIME protocol is handy, almost like a (slimmed down) NTP alternative, and the DISCARD protocol could be useful as a network-based /dev/null.\n What other protocols exist out there in the same vein? What use, if any, do they have in modern networks? What are some maybe fun or obscure protocols that can still be run on modern IP networks? I'd love more ideas to investigate here.

I even once wrote a Linux tutorial.\n I’m sure there should be demand for this and people would be interested in paying some monthly fee for someone skilled for looking after their stuff, but I don’t really know how to find it, because I’m used to working full-time in large companies.

I can’t get it to work again. I’ve removed the Authenticator device from the security portal, but when I go to add it back it fails (have tried via sign-in in the app as well which works), but still no push notifications. I have also checked blocked users in the multifactor authentication blade, but the account is not listed there.\n The only way I’ve found to get push notifications to work again, is to delete and recreate the 365 user, which is of course not ideal. \n Has anyone experienced the issue with Push notifications being blocked?

What are some higher positions that I can aim to get into? Why are some things that I SHOULD learn in my free time to improve? \n I feel like I’ve hit a road block, I do all those things and I code and develop websites on the side, but I’m not sure where the road takes me from here. Especially that I’m currently not very happy at my current position and was advised by a lot of you here to find another position, especially one that gives me better vacation days per year. \n My ultimate goal is to be happy, and to be fully remote/WFH. I’d like to hear it from the wise ones what they think I should do to improve and reach my goals. What did you do to reach your goals? \n On a side note, should I get a university degree? I dropped out 8 years ago and became a commercial aircraft pilot, but due to the pandemic and the Grindy nature of the industry, I reverted back into tech.

That's literally it. No other changes were made.\n Shortly after, I started to be unable to RDP into any of our on-prem Win2008/R2 servers or any Win7 machines that were domain-joined. If I try with Win10 mstsc, I get \"Your credentials did not work (the login attempt failed)\"\n If I try using RDP on the Win2022 DC, I get \"An internal error has occurred. Error code 0x4, extended error code 0x0.\"\n The hilarious bit is I can RDP into an on-prem WinXP VM sitting on a VMware hypervisor, and RDP from there to any of the on-prem machines I'm having trouble with. I can also RDP into any domain-joined VMs in Azure.\n I am completely stumped. Initially I thought NLA settings might somehow have changed on the on-prem servers, but I just checked one and it's set for lax NLA.\n Event viewer shows NOTHING. No persistent DFSR issues, nothing.\n dcdiag comes back clean on all DCs aside from irrelevant System log entries.\n UPDATE: It just started happening to the Azure DC as well, but it told me it was NLA, so I went and set SecurityLayer and UserAuthentication keys to 0 at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp using Remote Registry, and voila, I can now log on to an affected server.\n Obviously I'd prefer not to leave NLA off, any idea what might be causing this?\n    submitted by    /u/distractal  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Well folks, I've officially broke production it seems. I inherited a very broken Enterprise PKI, and in an attempt to get it to re-publish the CDP Location and DeltaCRL location, I renewed the root cert. \n I was sure to not generate a new public / private key pair. However after making that change users were no longer able to update group policy facing an error saying: \"...processing of Group Policy failed because of lack of connectivity to a domain controller...\" and \"... Windows could not authenticate to the Active Directory service on a domain controller. (LDAP Bind function call failed)...\"\n Upon looking at gpresult, it shows a few errors including: \"The system call to get account information completed. The call failed after 0 milliseconds\" and \"Error: Retrieved account information. Error code 0x5.\" and \"The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows could not resolve the computer name...\"\n DNS appears to be fine, and the computers are able to ping the DC's, and the domain itself with no issue. Looking at the DC's logs, there are many Kerberos-Key-Distribution-Center errors saying \"While processing an AS request for target service krbtgt, the account {laptop_name} did not have a suitable key for generating a Kerberos ticket (the missing key has an ID of 1). The requested etypes : 18. The accounts available etypes : 23 18 17. Changing or resetting the password of {laptop_name} will generate a proper key.\"\n ​\n I'd really appreciate any tips or help you folks can offer. So far people have just been unable to update group policy, but I bet authentication issues are close to follow due to the cached credentials.

          "description": "I swear I have tried to search for hits on this topic (here on Reddit and also via Google) and keep coming up empty. I have a situation in which a company is asking me how much I would charge them to have my certification status registered under them. Basically, they need someone in their corporate account that is holding three different technical certifications that I have or can get fairly easily (all three certs are very much my main focus in IT for the past 15+ years.). A friend of mine has told me that a colleague we both have in common will often do this for 5K for a 12 month agreement. I have heard of even higher numbers, which is mind boggling to me. But, as my friend explained, because incentives and sales discounts are often predicated on what status a company holds with a major vendor, these expenses of borrowing someone's certification status will often pay for themselves in very short time. I guess I am simply trying to understand what is reasonable based on the experience of others in here. Also, anything I should think about before agreeing to do this?

And with large amount, I mean roughly 700GB which I know some of you probably laugh about, but for our company that is the limit and my employer does not want to just buy more memory and I have to somehow make room for new data right now. The data right now is stored on a terminal server within a cloud and I don't know their price models but apparently it is kinda expensive to upgrade memory i guess.\n I have never engaged with data storage, backups or archiving before so I have no experience. We have the options of theoretically buying and installing our own backup server as we still have a lot of room in our server rack. Alternatively we could use some cloud option but I have the feeling that we would pay too much for something very simple. \n Also which OS would you use to make it simple and efficient? Is there some kind of linux distribution specializing in data backups/ archives? \n ​\n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable_Onion318  \n [link]   [comments]",

TikTok, ClipChamp, Amazon Prime etc. \n These apps are not technically installed, but install once clicked without any MS Account etc. I want to remove all of these apps except the relevant Windows apps (Notepad, Settings, etc etc) from the start menu pinned section. \n I need this to work for existing user profiles. Happy to run a script or change registry keys to remove this stuff. We are not an environment that uses MS Edge, Teams, etc. \n I have attempted to edit XMLs and JSON start layouts to no success. I was able to edit the start layout to remove most of these apps but this only worked for new profiles and even then, ClipChamp and Xbox kept appearing despite being removed. \n ​\n Thanks in advance for any guidance.\n    submitted by    /u/remydimauro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everybody. After installing this week's Windows 10 updates, our test machines seem to have some kind of administrative restriction now in place. Apps such as Teams, Slack and Policy-Pak will no longer run, but instead popup a blue box that says \"This app has been blocked by your system administrator.\"\n I've seen a little bit of chatter about it online, but nothing on this forum unless I missed it. Here's a link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1081649/administrator-restriction-after-install-kb5019959.html\n The applocker solution is worthless to us... applocker is not configured.\n Anyone else seeing this?

Should I mention not wanting to get too deep into Citrix or keep my head down and do as I’m told? I work in Europe so worker’s rights are really good here and I doubt anyone would consider letting me go for saying such things (although I am on probation still), but I just don’t know how to handle this situation. All i want is to not become the go-to-guy for something I have no interest in.\n Maybe there is something I’m also missing about Citrix stuff?

But often people forget to do it.\n We do not have such thing for when an employee leaves though. Not yet at least.\n ​\n My initial idea, was to add some sort of information message to managers, when I run my user disabling script.\n Or make some sort of formular, where it will send out an e-mail containing some basic information of the person quitting, so that it will trigger some script that will then run all the basics, and inform all the relevant people.\n Preferably a way where no one has to remember anything specific, other than maybe click a button.\n ​\n But I am not trying to get a discussion going on how bad we handle it, instead I am trying to get some ideas from other people in the same field.

          "description": "Thanks for taking the time to read this post.\n We run Exchange Server 2016 on-prem and will be migrating to Exchange Online (EXO) in the near future. It's about 300 users with 4TB-ish of data and some overly critical public folder mailboxes as well. Ideal end state is a hybrid setup, as we do have some legacy servers that need SMTP access. In addition, inbound mail will still go through Mimecast prior to being delivered to EXO.\n Since we are a small team, we engaged with an MSP to provide a quote to do some of the migration. They provided a \"get your tenant configured to best practices and migrate data\" quote in the six figure range. That seems very high to me based on the scope of work provided. \n Those of you who have done this migration, is it six-figures difficult? Also is the use of BitTitan (or similar) really necessary or can the built in migration tools do the job just as well? Having not run through the process I'd like to hear any feedback you may have. \n Thanks,\n _ns_\n    submitted by    /u/_nobodyspecial_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Of those, about half were unproductive, and 4 were straight up infuriating.\n Listen, if your remote access software does not allow me to immediately and consistently take over control from a tech, your remote access software is complete thrash. It's beyond thrash, as it would be more apt to call it malware.\n The amount of times I've had a tech veer off and start making unapproved changes to a production server are ridiculous. One guy straight up navigated away from the ME window and started uninstalling unrelated apps before I straight up spammed Ctrl+Alt+Del. Despite obviously fighting for mouse control for a full 10 seconds so I could even type a message to him, he continued trying to do it. \n It took me essentially swearing at him in caps (once I had control) for him to apologize and start asking permission before he made any further changes.\n This happened on 4 different occasions with 4 different techs.

          "description": "I took the position because it was my first offer and I need a job badly. The job pays 24/hour. My last position was a salaried IT support specialist, which came out to 25/hour (52k/year - yes, i believe I was overpaid there). This is a contract to hire position, and it was mentioned that if hired the salary would be around 70k, and from brief research in my state that's about right. I know I'm technically an employee of the contracting company, but am I being kinda shafted here? I'm not too hung up on this as the position looks great on my resume, but I am slightly annoyed by it, especially since I'm making less than I was in what many would consider a less in-demand position.

HR is putting on the pressure, as they said they'll have to pay them from their promised start date, even if they can't technically work yet. Has anyone experienced this problem and know some work arounds?\n Edit: for more context, I'm at a startup that's scaling quite quickly, so this has been an ongoing issue. Especially because we're based in the Netherlands and these new employees are mostly working remote. So I need to first get them delivered to the office, then set them up (MDM, etc), then dispatch to the employees wherever they are. We have a relationship with just one supplier, so always encouraged to go through them. However, seems like this won't be scalable.

I am reviewing the UPS situation so this question is solely looking at the R220 server.\n The server we have is an R220 with the H310 raid controller and Write Through enabled.\n Since Write Through is enabled there should be minimal loss (if any) during a power outage. Is there any advantage (other than performance) for upgrading the H310 to an H710P with a battery? Or does the advantage only come into play when Write Back is turned on?\n TLDR: If I have write through turned on with an H310, does upgrading to an H710P with a battery (with write through remaining on, NOT write back), do we gain any additional power loss protection?\n    submitted by    /u/divine_tyrant  \n [link]   [comments]",

I figure our home internet has dropped out or there's been a power cut so decide to try and connect to the NAS over the internet anyway.\n Oh. It's up. That's weird. Why is it saying it's disconnected from the Internet then? Ah well, let's login and see what's going on. Enter credentials, enter the MFA code and \"The verification code is incorrect\"\n Um. WTF? Try a couple more times and MFA simply isn't working. There's no other admin account to login to (default admin account is disabled - I'm not a total idiot. Yes, yes I know, exposing NAS to the internet etc etc).\n I get my son, who's at home, to reboot the NAS hoping it's a temporary blip. Nope. Still cannot login as the MFA code isn't working.\n At this point my imagination is running wild and I'm assuming that it's been hacked and the MFA for my admin account has been reset to the hacker's phone. Other normal user accounts (non-MFA) are working. The data is still there, no encrypted files or anything else untoward seems to be going on. So, what the hell? \n I check Synology forums and see posts about the time sync possibly being off but that isn't the case. I'm on the verge of asking my son to press the dreaded Reset button when I have a thought. I have a Active Directory domain at home and a single Zetec mini-PC box acting as DC. This also provides DNS for the home network. It couldn't be that could it? Why would that affect MFA on the NAS? \n I get my son to check if the Zetec box is on. It wasn't.

          "description": "Currently we are using a virtual data room solution that costs $6,000 for 2GB of storage and an additional $2000 per GB, so I am up to $8k annually. That seems really insane to me, and we are likely going to need to increase it to 4GB totaling 10K annually.\n I looked at other cloud storage solution providers, and for example, Box.com's Enterprise plan will allow me to only need to license internal users and all external users are free.\n With that, I could seemingly achieve the same thing for $2500 (5-6 internal users) instead of $8000. Not only that, but it includes unlimited storage as well which is a HUGE selling point to me.\n My use of our current data room solution solely exists to provide company financial files to investors. All that I need is activity audit logging, MFA, and granular permissions. It's used maybe once a year for a month or so during investor rounds, which makes the price tag even more painful.\n While we have SharePoint, I keep SharePoint use to internal only because its confusing to people, permission management is a PITA with external users, and audit reporting is no easy feat. I also want that clear delineation to employees to understand internal and external. I am just saying this so that I am not asked why I don't just use SharePoint for this.\n Is there something missing that I don't understand between the definition of a \"data room\" and just normal cloud storage setup to share with external/guest users?\n If you go look at Citrix ShareFile, theres specifically a data room tier that drops you from unlimited storage to 5GB of storage, and costs $448 a MONTH. Why is that a thing??\n Thanks!\n ​\n Edit: Based on the comments explaining the differences, it seems like we may be using a data room when we don't really need one for our specific purposes.

          "description": "We use a Windows 2016 server to run print jobs for our ERP system. All printing is direct - no print servers/sharing involved.\n For the past year, it seems like about 50% of Microsoft's updates breaks our printers. The exact scenario is: post-update, about 90% of the printers will have been defaulted to duplex printing, and about 90% of the printers will be using the generic Microsoft printer driver. (Note that these two groups do not always overlap; sometimes a printer will still have the correct driver, but will have been changed to duplex printing, or vice-versa.) This is not printer or driver specific; it occurs across several different makes/models and drivers.\n Fixing it is a relatively simple, but frustrating process: Just go into each printer's \"Advanced > Printing Defaults...\" and disable duplex. Afterwards, both issues will be resolved.\n We attempted to resolve this with a simple bit of Powershell, set to run (as admin) on system startup:\n  $printers = Get-Printer foreach($printer in $printers){ Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode 'OneSided' } \n However, Set-PrinterConfiguration only works after the printer has been manually fixed. Otherwise, it generates the following error:\n  Set-PrintConfiguration : Could not access configuration information for the specified printer. At C:\\Scripts\\Set_SingleSidedPrinting.ps1:7 char:5 + Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode ... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (MSFT_PrinterConfiguration:ROOT/StandardCi...erConfiguration) [Set-PrintConfiguration], CimException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x80070002,Set-PrintConfiguration \n Very frustrating. Any ideas how to resolve things? Either so that Windows Updates no longer cause the printing issue, or so that our script can reliably run, post-update?\n    submitted by    /u/ltwally  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has also been laggy when connected to Servers with a less than ideal connection. Not sure why my Input depends on the connection to the customer?\n So, suffice to say, i'm not happy with windows Terminal. Alacritty does everything great, except it doesn't have tabs.\n Putty also doesn't have tabs plus it's session management is... less than ideal.\n So, what do i do? My requirements are pretty basic. All Windows stuff can be done through PS. So all i really need is something that can do SSH, Tabs, maybe split windows. Stored sessions are a nice to have, but i'm fine copy pasting IPs and using my SSH config. Right Click Paste would be nice, but Ctrl+V works too. It should use Windows' build in OpenSSH, not putty and Pageant.

All your manager is interested in is that you getting done what he or she assigned to you. Spending 12 hours making sure that documentation is just right might get you a \"good job\" comment from the manager and might get you the recognization of being a good document writer but you know what a quick bullet list you did in 20 minutes will tick that task complete and that is what your manager is interested in\n After I got that concept through my head my life in IT became a cakewalk and more important my salary has tripled over the past 10 years (and pretty much no overtime). \n That's not to say I don't do anything extra. I spend a fair amount of time studying but I take a two-pronged approach. First, learn what is needed for the current job, the processes, the tech stack, the DBs etc. That is usually a month or two then, as I like to change jobs or get promoted every 2 or max 3 years I start studying for the job I want next. \n I no longer waste my time trying to be the go-getter, the superstar, or that person everyone goes to for the answers cause at the end of the day it's just a job and I'm going to get paid the same to write an amazing doc or a bulleted list.\n Also, remember the rule of 5.

We average about 10-15 over the Fall/Winter season, and they often last for several hours.\n I recently identified an issue with a UPS we have (Cyberpower) where it does not take over immediately upon power loss, so the last few winters when I thought it was taking over, our Dell PowerEdge R220 server has been shutting off (not gracefully) every power outage.\n I am working on getting a good UPS in place with network SNMP traps that is more reliable -- thinking Tripp Lite as I have had good luck with them in the past. Let me know if there is anything specific I should be looking for when it comes to UPS purchases for a small server rack for a local business with a server, NAS, modem, and a couple other small devices.\n I was thinking something along the lines of https://www.cdw.ca/product/tripp-lite-1000va-ups-smart-avr-w-installed-webcardlx-1urm/3826234?pfm=srh\n For the server itself... we currently have WD GOLD 3.5\" Enterprise HDD in there. Would there be any advantage to power loss data prevention by switching to the WD GOLD SSD with the power loss prevention feature? I have been looking for an excuse to move them over to SSDs, but only if it is a good safe guard against power loss. I know standard SSDs are not good for power loss protection, but are SSDs with power loss protection any better than the WD GOLD Enterprise HDDs I mentioned?\n The server we have also has an H310 raid controller and I was wondering if switching to H710p would offer any advantages to maintaining data integrity during a power outage? I understand the performance and IOPS difference between the two but not sure if one is better than the other for handling power loss.\n There's lots more info I could provide but just doing a quick write up for now.\n    submitted by    /u/divine_tyrant  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, recently my company have mentioned they want to potentially send me to a large city that is roughly 6 hours away (flying or driving, all travel is expensed) for a week out of every month for a project that’s expected to last a year or longer. \n Travel time are hours that go on the timesheet to make up my 40 hours for the week. A hotel and car will be provided. All work related expenses can be expensed if I provide a receipt. If driving my own car, I can expense the gas at .55c/km, which adds a nice small bump to my pay cheques.\n My main concern is that a quarter of my year will be spent away from home and family. I don’t have kids, only a girlfriend who would miss me being home but can deal with it. After a while, I don’t think I will really be able to enjoy my leisure time when the day is finished if I cannot go home to relax. \n It would be a decent learning experience but it’s experience I could get locally as well. I make under $60k CAD (~45k USD) in Ontario.\n I enjoy my job but feel they are asking a bit much of me. My boss implied that travel is part of the job but I feel that there needs to be additional monetary compensation.\n Do any of you guys receive compensation for this type of extended travel for long projects?

          "description": "I've been looking into this for a while now, and still coming up short. We're a non-profit in a small country with horrible internet access. Our 4 locations are basically small, gated cities. The big center has essentially the leadership (government), a medical clinic, a store, a school, and 70 residences. Nearby is the airport and aviation team. The other 3 remote locations are each about 10 homes and an office. Each center relies on a single internet connection for everything (houses, et al) at that location.\n We have an IT team of only 6, all at the central location. Our documentation is old, disorganized, and thus hard to go through and find what you need. I think we're making progress though.\n Computers are a mixed bag of domain computers and BYOD. Letting a tool scan the network has always given unwieldy results or so many results there's not a clue where to start.\n The issue is that we have no idea WHAT we're managing, and that needs to change. We've setup a trial of iDoit and had a go. It's a nice tool, but perhaps too manual. We have PRTG that can help, but it's got so many alarms from \"false\" devices found during the auto-scan.\n The question is...what are others using for inventory and documentation? I'm looking for a tool that can tell me what devices are where with what configuration. Hopefully, something that can schedule maintenance and show a change history.\n I've been googleing on and off for months, finding a lot of sales pitches and promises. Maybe a short trial, maybe not. I'm hoping that by asking here, perhaps the options can be twiddled down to a good couple instead of what I'm (not) finding.\n    submitted by    /u/QuimaxW  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do you think I’ll have to deal with backlash? \n My idea is to switch over 100+ iPads first since data on those isn’t a deal breaker like it would be for voice service. And do remote monitoring to see what the signal is in the areas we work, then if it’s a good fit, change over our smartphones. \n Anyone else switch their company over and do you have any regrets?\n I don’t consider AT&T a viable option at this point as their 5G rollout is so far behind and I did a bunch of testing last year and was not impressed.\n    submitted by    /u/n3fyi  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now, only some of their chemistry tests auto-verify, so I know it's possible. I'm gathering that the IT department there is notoriously slow (likely understaffed and not exactly giving priority to some lab passion project, understandably).\n Lab is on Cerner Millenium. I'm assuming that the set-up for this occurs in Cerner, but how? I've been taking some basic developing courses and would be happy to do this on the side as a portfolio project, but I don't even know if that's possible or where to start. Obviously I'd have to talk to IT at some point but hoping to get some input here before I even bring it up (in case it's absolutely crazy).\n As a side note, their Cepheid (COVID instrument) is not interfaced to Cerner at all, so they're manually typing in the 100s of Flu/COVID/RSVs they get in a day and then having a 2nd tech do a clerical check, which is absolutely bananas for the volume they get. If anyone knows where to start on that one as well, I'd love to attempt to tackle it if it's even remotely possible.\n TIA (and sorry if this is the wrong sub - I also posted in r/healthIT but not sure if that was right either - please redirect me)\n    submitted by    /u/wh3r3nth3w0rld  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, I'm a hardware engineer at some company. We have a device we collect data with that spits data out to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi has compiled code on it that saves the data to its local files and sends these files back to a lab PC over a closed wifi network. None of these devices are connected to the internet.\n During our testing, we're using Matlab to perform our testing procedures. Our auxiliary hardware is all reliant on proprietary Matlab drivers.\n To send commands to the RPi, we currently use Matlab to make a system call to Putty, which SSH's into the RPi and executes local code on the RPi. We need to do this hundreds of times per test, and it currently takes a couple seconds per Putty call, so the time stacks up. To push/pull files off the RPi, we have Matlab make a system call to an SFTP server.\n My question is: how would you execute the commands on the RPi faster than making system calls to Putty? My scenario to test speed is to execute a copy file command from Matlab 20 times, and time the results. Number to beat is about 40 seconds for those 20 copies. I've tried using the Paramiko library in Python, but it was slower than Putty. I've also tried using a 3rd party Matlab plugin based around the Ganymede Java library, but there's some problem with keys on our model of Rpi, even when I manually try to add keys to the RPi. My next move is a Python library called ssh2-python, but I need to get Visual on the lab PC, which will take some time given our IT situation.\n I was also toying with the idea of using TCP sockets in either Python or C++, but I'm not really familiar with TCP. I'm not a network person, so I'm kind of blindly stumbling from potential solution to potential solution. Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/jlark92  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are quite a lot of tutorials on how to generate a root ca and an intermediate CA, while there are also Howtos for generating TLS certificates.\n As far as I understood, you sign the CSR of your intermediate by your root ca and your SSL csr by your intermediate CA. You import and trust the root ca and every certificate signed by the intermediate should be trusted too.\n Well. That doesn’t work. If I, for example, check the certificate of google with MacOS Certificate Assistant, the whole chain of trust is visible. If I check my certificate, I only see the TLS cert and the assistant cries about the untrusted intermediate certificate.\n It looks like the chain between root and intermediate is broken. If read the Wikipedia article about x509 and the lead me to more questions. It looks like the certificate only contents some basic information about it’s ca (in my case the intermediate) like public key ,algorithm, etc. but no information about the root ca. How ist my browser supposed to know who signed the intermediate ?\n Or is the information on Wikipedia not complete and I have to bundle the CAs certificates with my TLS cert ?\n I have an headache now.

Twice this year (so far), users have deleted massive folders/files (10-50k files) because they wanted to get rid of the sync'd folder on their pc - when they should have simply stopped the sync in the onedrive app.\n As you can imagine, doing massive restores from the recycle bin is extremely time consuming and it's tricky restoring from our cloud backup provider as it's usually not the entire site that is deleted.\n I was hoping MS had a policy we could set to stop bulk deletions (max deletions at a time = 20 or something along those lines), but from what i read and what MS support tells me, the only way to stop these deletion is to remove 'delete' permissions from all of our permissions, except for a select few staff. This also appears to disable renames as well.\n Is that truly the only way to stop this from occurring? Are there any O365 SharePoint settings to stop deletions in general? \n Thanks for your input!\n    submitted by    /u/Someone_Says_Hello  \n [link]   [comments]",

I notice it... again. \n more issues.... reappears...\n again..\n today is the 7th time in 10 years i have seen this fucking server that wont die. \n I think its taunting me. oh, and my co-workers are incompetent.\n    submitted by    /u/hurkwurk  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I'm instructed to log out and back into an Adobe ID as a resolution one more time, I swear to fuck something is getting burnt down. Issues are inconsistent; some users can use the entire suite, others none of it, a few can use everything besides Acrobat. Even worse, my licensing provider will tell me something is included (such as Adobe Sign) and Adobe tells me that it isn't.\n So that leaves me, stuck in the middle, screaming like an absolute Karen, \"We paid for licensing, fucking fix it!\" I feel as if I'm screaming into the void, with no solution in sight, all the while staff can't perform their duties from lack of access.\n Has anyone experienced similar issues with this shit-show of a company or has any suggestions? Neither Adobe or my licensing provider has been able to provide a fix in over a month, and I'm at wits end.\n Edit: So fun fact, Adobe Sign doesn't come with Creative Cloud K-12 Shared Device licensing, so if an Adobe employee tells you otherwise, you call them a damn dirty liar. It took A MONTH for Adobe to figure that out. Guess we can't even expect them to do sales correctly either.\n    submitted by    /u/savvysquirtle  \n [link]   [comments]",

I questioned this and was told it's fine, but it isn't sitting well with me. I'm thinking about bringing it up a level because if a user did this I'd be pissed.\n I suggested consumer VPNs and reminded my manager that we know nothing about these devices, have not given any instructions on the use of the VPN, and this will expose our secure network which in all other circumstances we are very protective of. \n Usually this manager can see reason, I'm not really getting this. It's like I'm talking to an end user. One of the VIPs doesn't even work in our company, it's a friend.\n I'm just doing it, but we go through so much effort to keep our network secure, jumping through hoops and implementing rigorous compliance standards, rolling out lengthily policies and reworking our internal processes to avoid creating gaps like this, only for what... some VIPs want to go on vacation and can't pay $10 for a month of Mozilla VPN.\n    submitted by    /u/InterestingParty260  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are considering offloading this task to HR as this seems more within their realm of responsibility, but we are unsure what the best way to go about it is.

          "description": "Happy Friday Sysadmins! Do you have any plans this weekend? If not, I might have something you can sink your teeth into... Number Matching in MS Authenticator. \n It's a feature which essentially rather than prompt a user for a \"yes/no\" \"approve/deny\" response on their phone, asks a user to enter a number into a prompt box. This effectively blocks an attacker from flooding their phone with MFA requests, fatiguing them into accepting, thinking it's something they've done wrong; because the user will never see the number and the attacker will instantly know that attack won't work.\n This feature went GA last week but some of you may have had it in preview for the last couple of months, it's pretty solid and I thoroughly recommend it. From a users perspective, it's no more effort than an old school SMS code, and a tiny bit more than hitting \"approve\"\n The only thing I dislike about it from a users perspective, is that I can no longer simply hit \"approve\" from my Apple watch.. so be mindful of that with your execs and managers, I guess..?\n My video talking about it, demoing it and showing you where the settings are in Azure AD can be found here:\n https://youtu.be/cjsViEclw1I\n Apologies for the croaky voice, I'm unwell but wanted to get my weekly video out there and keep up with helping the small community of followers I've been working with for the past couple of months.\n If anyone wants any help with this, hit me up!\n    submitted by    /u/mnealitpro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was trying to replicate this but I was having mixed results. I first tried copying the file name as its written with mth.pdf and it changed to a PDF.

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n it has been a long time since I last used group policies to administer servers or other computers. Right now we have a terminal server which everyone logs into and uses. I want to prevent certain users from turning off the server by applying the specific group policy rule. From my memory, I think I did the right steps but just now I tested it and it didnt work. I did the following steps:\n  \nMove Terminal Server to OU 'Servers'\n Link GPO to 'Servers' with User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar > Remove and Prevent Access to the shutdown command activated. \n Link another GPO to 'Servers' with Computer Configuration\\ Administrative Templates\\ System\\ Group Policy\\Configure user Group Policy loopback processing mode activated.\n Set security group for both only allowing the Standard-User Group to apply the policy.\n gpupdate on terminal server\n  \nWhat I expect to happen is the machine reading the loopback policy on startup, however I'm not sure if I just prevented that using a security-group. Do I need to include the machine itself inside the security group? How is it different than using \"authenticated users\". \n After reading the loopback policy, the Server tries to read the user config policy but ignores it, because it is not a user. Now when a user logs into the machine, although not being inside the OU, the user reads the user configuration from the policy because loopback is applied and applies the policy, when the user is a member of the security group. \n I'm certain I made a mistake somewhere because otherwise it would work. \n ​\n Thanks for any help\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable_Onion318  \n [link]   [comments]",

The exe (which i used USSF from that post a few days ago) does not have any hidden flags. It appears that it is simply an exe that when launched, extracts the files.\n So I am off to figure out where it puts its extracted files and go from there on how to install this.\n I don't normally rant, but when they told me they don't have any method of mass deployment and to use a tool like SCCM, I was astounded. We use other tools, but they don't support installers that offer no command line install options...\n    submitted by    /u/Fresh_Admin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This was just a weird situation all around, and I just needed to rant about it for a bit. This happened about 2 weeks ago.\n In the middle of the IT department, there is a table with our primary printer. One day, randomly, there were cupcakes and a bag with a brand name on it (the bag also contained 2 handwritten cards directed to our director and CIO). I asked around, no one knew where they came from. My coworkers started eating the cupcakes, but I didn't because I had a bad feeling about them. You need a key fob to get into our building, we had never heard of the brand before, and no one saw the person who dropped them off.\n Fast forward a couple of hours. I'm in the restroom and so is the building's receptionist. \"How did you guys like your cupcakes?\" she asked. I looked at her, confused, and asked what she knew about them.\n \"Well, a guy came in and said they were for the IT department. I couldn't get ahold of anyone, so I just sent him back.\" Awkwardly, I told her none of us saw him and none of us knew who he was, either.\n \"Oh.\"\n Getting back to my desk, I tell my coworkers what I had learned. Some random vendor we've never dealt with before personally delivered cupcakes. Whatever, vendor wants you to buy their products. What upset me more is that our receptionist just let a random person into the building for really no reason. We're not government or anything like that, but why have key fobs for the doors if our receptionist is going to let just about anyone in?\n Apparently I was the only one freaked out by that - everyone else had a cupcake. Luckily, they were just regular cupcakes, but still. That did NOT sit well with me.\n Rant over.\n    submitted by    /u/TheGreatestJaggi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got a vulnerability warning in the Defender portal showing that 27 of my devices have OpenSSL installed and need to be updated. The part that's confusing me here is that I can find no trace of OpenSSL installed on these systems. The only place that it shows as installed is in the Defender portal. There's no trace of it in the Windows Registry, nothing in the system path, no services running, nothing in the installed apps list, etc. But Defender is going as far as pulling in different version numbers from somewhere. \n Any ideas on what's happening here? This is only showing on about half of my devices. All have been deployed through Intune. We don't do any sort of custom certificate management and I've sure never set up OpenSSL to be deployed, so I'm not sure where it's coming from as it isn't very consistent. Some of these devices were deployed months ago, one was freshly ran through autopilot earlier this week. \n Much thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction here.\n    submitted by    /u/ChunkyMooseKnuckle  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now the question is, how do I identify which version of Apache is vulnerable? I didn't find anything on apache.org about the library which should be included in this version.\n I read, that there should be a library with the name \" Apache Commons Text versions 1.5 through 1.9. \", which is vulnerable. But how do I find this library on the system? Is this even possible?\n ​\n thank you for any support.\n ​\n edit: I found the library ( Commons Text – Download Apache Commons Text ). Can I just install it on the Linux machine? or should I update the whole apache? How can I identify that it isn't vulnerable anymore?\n    submitted by    /u/_Eulenmongol_  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of us - fairly senior member of the team- became concerned about this and basically said:\n \"Well the whole point of MFA is you have a known password, and then a thing, and that thing is either a hardware token, or the MFA app - However if the app now stores passwords, doesn't that defeat the purpose of MFA?\"\n From my point of view, it would be way too much of a faux pas if Microsoft just hadn't thought of this, and with our phones being in Intune, they have to have a password, they likely have biometrics etc, so i cant see it being an issue?\n Also i just tried signing in with my work account to the password keeper part, and it wouldnt accept the details, as it needs to be a Microsoft account, not a Work or school account.\n Does anyone else have any views on this that would help me articulate clearly to my colleague why this wouldnt be a security issue?

That server is hosted on Hetzner. Hetzner has been contacting me with abuse requests (AbusePhishing: SPAM/PHISH Complaint) that people have sent them and is now threatening to shut down the server. I had a look at those forwarded emails and I discovered that the Message-ID hashes cannot be found in my /var/log/mail* logs (I have enough logs to cover the timestamps that those emails have allegedly been sent from my server). The emails content contains the newsletter content from the site but also appends various Pfizer spam links and images. All other legit emails that the site has sent can very easily be found via grepping their Message-IDs in /var/log/mail*.\n Question: Is there a possibility that a malicious actor has subscribed to the site's newsletter, copy/pasted the email that was sent to them, polluted it with spam links, and reported this as an abuse to their provider, in hope that it'll reach Hetzner which will in turn threaten with shutting down the server?

They are on the clock the soon they enter the premises, and they have to be ready to start working asap. \n As a company, we have our internal courses for training purposes, and this includes almost every subject that touches the company, and some of those courses are mandatory, even for IT staff like me.\n However, having this type of messaging via wallpaper, seems overboard to me, and having to file requests to go before CAB, any GPO changes go to CAB no matter what the purpose is, for this is ludicrous.\n Time is better spent to educate the users with proper courses, not via a small text on the wallpaper, with horrible colours.\n ​\n So, my fellow professional Redditors, how would you approach this if it comes into your lap? What better solution would you recommend, and what is your general opinion of delivering messages via desktop wallpapers every other week or more?\n    submitted by    /u/OpenScore  \n [link]   [comments]",

For as good as this company used to be, it's gone downhill in recent years. The support (or lack of) we're getting is making us think they have no idea how the tool works. We're a small outfit so it's possible they've given us less experienced techs, but we're still talking about moving 800 endpoints and a lot of files. I'm getting nervous about using the tool to re-permission files when they don't seem to have a grasp on what the tool is doing. I want a backup plan.\n The sAMAccountName is the same in both source and target domain. File servers are located in and permissioned to the target domain.\n Here's my question: does anyone have a suggestion for a tool or script that can view the permissions for files in the source domain and add the matching target domain user?\n I'm more of a bash guy, but I can learn enough PowerShell to get this job done if necessary.

Today I use packer to build and distribute our new monthly windows images to our azure regions. Word made it to the powers that be that my image is better documented (infra as code essentially) and more consistent than what our on-prem server team is doing. So naturally they decided that I should just \"provide the image\" to the infra team to use on the vcenters. Problem is I am way out of my element here. I have a repeatable process to get the azure images down as an VHD to the hybrid runbook worker. The problem I haven't figured out is how to get them into a format the VMware guys can use. \n So with the long context out of the way, anyone got any good step by step guides or YouTube video they can recommend to get azure images into vSphere as a template?

Looked at Backblaze B2 but its not really built for that. Google cloud storage supports the idea of it but is expensive and still isn't really designed to be easily browsed like a filesystem. Certainly Dropbox or similar services could work well ... but we're duplicating systems and costs then which seems silly. Management suggested just start new on drive.google.com and keep running the legacy servers but that doesn't fix the issue of the old, failing equipment.\n In a perfect world there would be select folders that you would stream to Google Drive for Desktop and then others would only be available at drive.google.com but that doesn't seem possible like it once was in older versions? Thought about setting up a separate Google active-archive user that staff could login to but with 70 people and changing staff that seems cumbersome at best. \n Any suggestions?\n Thanks!\n -Adam\n    submitted by    /u/Hody-dody-tech  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n Backupify was driving me nuts,\n I just switched to AFS last night, they backed up my 100GB mailbox in 5:06 minutes, insane speed.\n They gave me option to choose datacenter which I could not find with other solutions, this made compliance easy for one of our domains has to be in Canada due to healthcare rules.\n The interface is clunky, but the speed and cost are amazing,\n I wanted to go back to spinbackup due to the search/discovery and security features for multi-domain environments (I find it cheaper then enhancing and building policies in multi-domains), but their prices seemed to have doubled in the pandemic and the multi-domain is complicated.\n AFS seems to hit the multi-domain part well, I got various licenses at multiple entities so getting a solution where everything is under one hood is nice. I have some domains with Gsuite+M365 and others that are just Gsuite and some just M365.\n Anyways the setup and configuration took me about 25 minutes, I set it all up myself and have all my sites / teams / mailboxes etc... all backed up now and I am saving a few hundred bucks a month which I will use now to setup some other compliance tools.\n I am still searching for a solution that has a faster and easier interface to run searches across multi-domains / platforms (Gsuite/M365), right now I use an expensive tool and its a pain in the bum for the queries, if anyone knows of a moderately priced solution like AFS I am interested. I have to run searches for PDF's and the content within PDF's regularly, which is why I sync things to google drive as they have ability to search PDF's.\n    submitted by    /u/WeAreAIreadyPuppets  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The firm I work for has a small residential site in a rural area in the UK (South/West Wales). From the looks of it there's no chance of anything other than 3mbit ADSL via the phone line or less than ideal 4G using an external antenna. There's no altnets in the area and leased lines are looking at £800/month which isn't really feasible.\n However, as this site will need to provide public and staff internet connectivity we will need decent bandwidth (say up to 80mbit download), so we're looking to use starlink to provide this.\n I was wondering if anyone here has used Starlink for this kind of fixed site job and had any information regarding reliability and ease of configuration? My main worry is being able to use my own router/firewall if the supplied unit doesn't have the features we need. Also does anyone know if the \"domestic\" tier has any acceptable use limits?\n    submitted by    /u/WelshRareDit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I thought I'd share some key points from a talk I did on Shadow IT as it's most often the sysadmins that have to battle with it.\n Tackling shadow IT is a never ending battle. You need to be vigilant and always looking for improvements.\n It's a human problem if your company hires humans you have shadow IT\n Decreasing friction and improving the relationship between the service provider (You) and users is the most effective way to minimize shadow IT\n You need to understand what exists where through mechanisms that can't be bypassed. Instead of importing your excel sheet of NetBIOS names into an asset inventory tool, scan all your IP ranges. You will be shocked by how much unknown stuff sits on your network.\n Tools like WDAC and App locker are great if your just starting to tackle the problem.\n Don't villainize your self by snapping at users you catch with shadow IT. Understand why it exists and what you can do provide an appropriate alternative.\n Because your always going to have Shadow IT take a risk based approach and tackle the stuff those poses the most danger even if it's easier to remove that weird app Janet in finance uses.\n Once you have a strong understanding of what's in your consistency explore more 'heavy handed' technologies like Network access control. You can use these technologies to mitigate while you solve the problem.\n    submitted by    /u/LucyEmerald  \n [link]   [comments]",

The provider gave two WAN schemes and were insistent upon having to use both for the service to work, referring to one group as the \"LAN\". I researched dedicated internet for some time and realized it is innately different than the usual internet service with shared pipes. \n This was months ago but am seeing more events of customers signing up for this and then passing the buck to IT and it only being a problem once the cutover happens and nothing works as expected. The last thing I remember in first example was the provider suggesting I set up my \"LAN\" with this public scheme and basically NAT traffic from one scheme to the other to show outbound coming from their \"WAN\" scheme. \n If not obvious already I feel I'm clearly missing something here: can anyone chime in on best practice to get this working as expected? Have set up countless networks and helped facilitate cutovers for businesses utilizing static WANs before, but this dedicated internet setup obviously involves more than just the WAN port config and bridge mode modem that had come to be the expectation.

          "description": "There are a few users who are getting bitten with the “my account is locked out every morning” bug. We’re hybrid, the account in O365 is fine when on-prem is locked. The usual tools and logs always point to bad password. User always claims it’s entered properly. Users are mobile, and the problems seem to occur on boot or waking up. OS is Windows 10.\n My current theory is that these lovely (/s) USB docks may be delayed in registering to Windows and identifying keyboards. And in that delay possibly the password, while being typed, isn’t keying in all the characters. Netwrix lockout auditor, DC event logs, etc, never show logon events from any other workstation, so I don’t believe it’s anything malicious. Our helpdesk is done with the problem, so it’s a sysadmin issue now. \n My insane idea is to throw a keylogger on one of their laptops and capture what’s being typed when they have this issue. In order to see if I’m right about mistyped passwords being the culprit. Because I have a feeling if I call Microsoft, I’m going to be pissing away $500 and months of my time arguing with the level 1 crowd, and going nowhere. \n If anyone has any other ideas, I’m game. \n Sorry for the long post.\n    submitted by    /u/thegodfatherderecho  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, my last role was two years ago as a vCIO and then I funded two businesses that are still going on but I don't want to be in them anymore. I realized I can't do the constant remote, the 13hs a day... I just can't. \n I'm an introvert, I like to think, strategize and implement. My background is in network security mostly and I like that a lot. I used that knowledge and some people skills to work selling equipment, and even though that is not what I love and where I thrive, I can do it if I need to. I quickly learn IT products and can explain how they work. \n I went to a trade school, studied engineering, dropped out, and went to business administration while working at Net. Sec. - I like the IT world, I'm passionate about security and privacy but I also like the processes and structures where I can create a place for teams in businesses can work and can have success in what they do. I always jokingly called myself the architect of my businesses because I can easily connect or relate all the software, systems, and processes to make sense of it for the business and find ways to leverage all of them. And now I realize that's kind of a career as well. \n I would like to do something with my business experience and I was thinking Enterprise Architecture could be something interesting. I don't want to go back to configure firewalls or anything really. I could sell, but I rather not. \n Has anyone of you jumped and moved laterally like me? What's your experience?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/karmatias  \n [link]   [comments]",

Microsoft suggest upgrading (!!!) or moving to SQL for the Connection Broker (!!! again) OR re-enable TLS 1.0 (see Remote Desktop service (RDS) Connection Broker or Remote Desktop Management service (RDMS) fails - Windows Server | Microsoft Learn ) but they don't specify how to re-enable TLS 1.0\n I'm asking what the best way to do that is - I believe it's a combination of registry keys but I've seen differing recommendations as to what keys are required.\n    submitted by    /u/Ramjet_NZ  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use various cloud platforms to back up the important stuff, but they set this up to get every thing on the local machine “just in case” \n It is incredibly time consuming and in constant need of attention or process change due to OS updates or our MDM applying new policies, and that the software/devices perform very intermittently. \n We use Cellebrite digital collectors (MacQ) for our Mac and Windows computers. Apple is already more difficult to navigate with this, and we still cannot obtain full images from M1 macs. I run into constant issues with the software freezing/crashing and, without any issues, the image can take anywhere from 1-5 hours to complete, so coupled with these issues, I can spend days working on these and make very little progress. \n Since starting this work, I don’t believe even one file has ever been booted with an actual need to find something. \n I am having a hard time seeing exactly why we need to have these images. With all the systems in place to record an employee’s work and the machines activity, I just don’t see how booting these images up later can be too useful. When researching, it seems like I am in a pretty narrow use-case, and it seems like there would be better tools and documentation if this was a larger and needed operation.

Both of these apps are new to me.\n I've been getting alerts from one of our web servers having over 80% space used. I checked it out and it looks like that New Relic is currently using up 16GB of logs in \"C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs\". I have a feeling this probably isn't necessary.\n Two questions:\n  \nIs there any way to enable some kind of log rotation here? It looks like we're using the .Net agent. After scouring the documentation for hours, all I can find is info on how to do this for the Java agent. Is there no way to set this up with the .Net agent? If so, how?\n If log rotation isn't a thing for the .Net agent. Would I be safe in archiving (or deleting) most of these logs? Would this effect our New Relic instance?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/pSykAwtiX-Work  \n [link]   [comments]",

They send their certificates to my Cisco ISE server, but the certificate chain is incomplete so they get rejected (as they should!).\n All I need is to acquire the root cert for Alcatel \"Wired Phones\", but this appears to be much harder than it should be. I have found the below in a forum:\n  \nThe certificates from the Alkatel business portal doesn't work as these are not the correct CA's signed the certificate of the phone. You have to obtain the correct CA \"Wired Phones\" from your Alkatel local vendor. \n  \nDoes anyone happen to have obtained this certificate?

          "description": "I have a firewall and two linux servers. I would like to aggregate the logs in a central location, run some basic analysis to identify potential issues and, ideally, be alerted when issues are identified. I realize a full SIEM implementation is probably beyond my budget and pay grade but would like to improve our logging and use of our logs. My goal is to reduce the amount of time I spend inspecting logs on 3 different machines.\n One server is remote and should connect via TLS, the firewall and other server are on the same local network I wish to implement the log server. I prefer opens source on windows but I am willing to consider a Linux based solution as well. Spending a little money is an option if the feature justify the expense but I really don't have a budget for this.\n I've discovered there are a plethora of tools ranging from simple log servers to full SIEM available with a dramatic range in prices. I would really appreciate it if someone could help steer me in a good direction to help me understand what people enjoy using and find appropriate for small environments like mine. I imagine, like in many other areas of IT, there are certain tools that get used a lot and have more active communities. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Jacob_C  \n [link]   [comments]",

It won’t work if a guest has the gateway.\"\n ​\n Is that correct? \n ​\n thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/BulletRisen  \n [link]   [comments]",

Two of them are D4s v3's (4 vCPU + 16GiB RAM), and the last is a B2s (2 vCPU + 4 GiB RAM). There's a reservation in place which brings the monthly bill to approximately C$650 (US$476). This is getting a bit too expensive, especially considering that we'd like to add another VM. From looking at the bill, it seems that the main cost is the Windows Server VM License cost. Aside from the cost, the setup is optimal for the owner of the business as all of the employees can login at once (2 max per VM) and the work is synced through the use of SyncThing.\n ​\n Is there a recommended alternative that we can switch to? Or is this license cost going to exist everywhere?

The primary reason is that we’re a hardware startup and we want to give people a way to work on the platform without mailing prototype boards around the country. We do have an office and a lot of people do come in a few days a week as well, so we want most of them to have a dedicated area. We were thinking about using static IP’s and Guacamole RDS to accomplish this. Is this a terrible idea?

I generally don’t try to do an analysis to determine for each vulnerability or update how susceptible we might be. I know I can get burned this way, but I rather risk getting burned by a patch than leaving a known vulnerability in place. I do check reddit to see if a patch Tuesday is particularly rough.

OIT, for some bizarre reason, does not provide project sponsors to students and you are expected to find one in a span of about two weeks. Yes you read that right - you need to find a project sponsor with a Capstone-level project lying around for you to complete on top of managing your established work schedule (we're a commuter school). This is obviously insane and thankfully they offer the option to do a research project instead and write about your findings.\n My problem is... I don't really know what to research. Specifically, our project needs to bring to light a problem in the world and how we can apply our knowledge to fixing that problem. My focus for my degree was on Network and Systems Administration. I know how networking equipment/the internet works, how AD works, some basic programming, took several business courses, and learned a bit about cybersecurity along the way.\n My original project idea was how IoT implementation can benefit businesses and the security risks with IoT devices. My advisor doesn't really like this idea and insists that it won't be a big enough topic to fill 350 hours of work for the next year. I worry she may be right, but she doesn't seem to be giving me any usable project ideas. \n Any idea what kind of research project could fit the bill? Something networking/security or business-adjacent would be highly preferable. Thanks for the help, and feel free to ask me whatever.\n    submitted by    /u/STRMfrmXMN  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to upgrade it to a version of Windows Server which won’t be EoS next year, I want to have minimal downtime and I don’t want to do an in-place upgrade. Also, there’s a lot of data. \n So I’m wondering what the most efficient way of doing this is. In the past for smaller sites I’ve removed the old server from the replication group, stood up a new VM and added to the group, kicked off replication and waited. I don’t want to do that this time though due to the amount of data. \n So do I stand up a new VM side-by-side with Server01, robocopy the data, then when I’m ready rename and change the IP of Server01 and put that IP and host name on the new VM? If this is best, do I need to exclude dfsrprivate?\n I’ve also considered adding the new VM to the replication group with a name like Server02 while Server01 is still in production. Then wait for replication to finish, then (overnight) rename, remove from group and power off Server01 and then rename Server02 ‘Server01’. I feel like that’s a bad idea but I need to hear someone say it!\n Or is there a better method that I haven’t considered yet?

Swap file disabled.\n Also because duplicated files in linux are referenced not physically duplicated try to make unique files.\n Also always check extreme parameters like 100% read or write workload or test very small 1KB or 1GB to avoid lags when for example somebody decides to upload big file or put this file as a blob to the database. \n Analyze data in a statistical manner. When parameters are gradually increased look for linear or logarithmic spread of the results to ensure disk performance is predictable\n  \nIs there anything more to know when benchmarking disks to choose the optimal one ?\n \nI'm wondering if apps for automatic tests like webdriver io imitating concurrent users in not so random fashion should be used beside the usual fio and sysbench i use ?\n \nI know that linux filesystem is little different due to points I mentioned earlier, is there anything else worth knowing in this subject which may affect the results of benchmark disk ?\n \n    submitted by    /u/labratdream  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have tried to reconstruct them here. As this was 10 years ago, it may not be 100% what he said, but I think it's pretty close.\n troubleshooting FC:\n  \nhost (initiator) HBA driver\n host HBA status\n switch port for initiator\n cabling to initiator\n zoning connecting the initiator to target\n cabling to target\n port on target\n LUN to port mapping\n port security\n  \nStart with 1 and go to 9, for all things able to be checked remotely first, then check physical. 3-7 can be checked partially with one step, checking the switch to make sure they show links. This excludes 90% of issues. Leave checking the physical cabling and SFPs until all others are excluded. So, troubleshooting order should be 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 3/4, 6/7\n May it be useful to someone, someday.\n    submitted by    /u/dangitman1970  \n [link]   [comments]",

In recent months we have noticed more phishing emails being allowed through Mimecast and delivered to our users. We have very little in the way of EOP policies in place, our original thinking being that Mimecast is our email security layer in the first instance, not EOP. We're now thinking about enabling the policies in EOP to act as a second line of defence. We've even noticed genuine phishing emails that have come through Mimecast to then be flagged as phishing by EOP, but delivered to user mailboxes due to our EOP Anti-spam -> Connection filter policy that has all the Mimecast IPs within it, which then bypasses the majority of checks. Not good!\n Is anyone here running in this manner with Mimecast and EOP or indeed another security product sat in front of EOP? I'd be interested to hear how your EOP policies are configured, with regards to:\n  \nAnti-phishing\n Anti-spam\n Enhanced filtering\n Safe Links (Minecast vs EOP - We're using Mimecast, which as I understand is a retrospective check of URLs when a user clicks)\n  \nAre your users OK with having multiple places to check for quarantined/junk emails? e.g. 1st line product (Mimecast in our case), Microsoft and Junk folder in Outlook.\n Are we attacking this in the wrong way and should be focusing on tightening up Mimecast rather than looking at EOP?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/brepmassive  \n [link]   [comments]",

AP equipment from CISCO took literally 6 months to get. Pushed back demolition of building near the shop as our Fuel Management Pump System is there and would be cut off from internet before AP installed if we demo'd \n AC in shop storage room went out. Was asked for some reason to handle it so contacted and scheduled the recommended person boss wanted to use and it's taken them a week to finally come out but shop manager sends me repeated emails on when this is going to get done.\n Anytime I order equipment needed outside the basics it takes a week or even two to arrive. Bosses complain every time saying it should be 2 days tops like everything is Amazon.\n All Vendors I deal with lately whether its security system maintenance or door fixes/AC are behind in work and take days to show up sometimes.

(classic make or buy decision)\n ​\n Now I am currently in the phase to check/analyse what is available out in the wild that we could probably integrate so we don't have to re-invent the wheel. \n This is why I am asking for your suggestions/recommendations of software/platforms that I might wanna have a look at. \n ​\n Our clients who use our document management system want to be able to provide a selection of documents via a \"portal\" to their customers. Their customers might be other businesses or private people. For example a bank that wants to provide the bank statements to their customers via such portal. Or a construction company that wants to provide technical drawings to their contractors. etc. \n ​\n The basic use case is more or less the same, though the industry varies. \n ​\n The platform would sit in between the consumer of the documents and our document management system. \n Most likely the communication between the platform and the DMS should be via REST API's.\n ​\n Do you know of any solution that might cover the basic or advanced requirements of such a \"portal\" ?\n ​\n I'm also considering building something with the M365 platform (PowerApps, Azure Functions, PowerAutomate, etc.)\n ​\n One of the solutions I'll be looking at will be https://www.deepbox.swiss/en/overview/\n ​\n Any ideas/suggestions are welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/--The_Cheshire_Cat--  \n [link]   [comments]",

The PIM page says the page will refresh by itself, you don't need to sign out/in. \n I've been trying this for the past couple of hours, and I kept having to sign out/in because waiting 3-5 minutes was yielding no change - the 365 admin page and the ECP page were giving a 'no access sucker' unless I signed out/in.\n Meanwhile, after assigning direct access, then unassigning direct access, then trying again using PIM, it now HAS worked without signing out and in again. Is this the usual experience others have had, or have I just been particularly unlucky with propagation delays\n ​\n 2- The Exchange recipient administrator role in particular seems bad for this - I assign it and activate it on my test account, but it doesn't seem to do bugger all. I activate it, I sign out, sign in, do a little dance, and still don't have access to the ECP. \n Meanwhile, I assign it to be permanently active, sign out, sign in, BAM it's immediately there and works flawlessly. \n ​\n I've signed out and in to these accounts so many times I'm ready to sign out of existence entirely,I just want someone to confirm whether or not this is the experience other people have had or if I'm just having a particularly bad friday night. \n ​\n I'm gonna go make a cup of tea and cry into it while I wait to see if it's just been me all along\n    submitted by    /u/8ftmetalhead  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is believed that 2 are in a RAID 1 for the OS and the remaining 4 in a RAID 5 but it is not confirmed. I won't get into why we couldn't confirm that, it's a long story, but just go with it. \n The drives were pulled BUT I realize that we did not note down the exact slot each drive came from. We will need to pop them back in further down the road. My initial thought process was the RIAD controller should be smart enough to figure it out, but I am realizing that might not be the case and I may have made a grave mistake.\n Just wondering if there's any insight on whether or not the physical slot matters when it comes time to plug them back in. \n Thank you very much\n    submitted by    /u/Wittinator  \n [link]   [comments]",

In a Microsoft Windows ecosystem (with mostly on-prem Active Directory but a little Azure AD mixed in), what does this look like? Does Microsoft have some basic PAM options built into their OS/Directory services? is there a separate Microsoft solution you can use (or purchase) that creates a basic PAM solution? if not, what third-party options exist? we use the following vendors for additional infrastructure services so something from them would be nice: Azure, Microsoft 365, Quest, SolarWinds, CrowdStrike, Mimecast, Duo, Palo Alto. I'm also curious what is the minimum configuration that meets the requirement of a PAM solution (can we make a low-level version of one out-of-the-box without having to purchase/install additional solutions)?\n    submitted by    /u/jwckauman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "How do you manage Backup Targets & Selections in your IT shops? For example, let's say you have 100 Windows Servers and 10 Windows 10 clients and you have been tasked with installing a brand new backup solution that backs up files and folders via backup agents. You are creating the new backup job, and you have to decide which servers/clients get agents installed, and which server/client disks/folders you want to select as part of your backup jobs. Does IT just make an educated guess at what needs to be backed up? Does the business unit provide IT with a list of data sources (structured and unstructured) and IT works off of that? \n In our shop, IT decides what should be selected for backup on a daily basis knowing where actual company data lives. If it can't be recreated elsewhere, we back it up. If there is another source of that same data (and its current, then we skip it). For example, we do backup our home and shared folders, but we don't back up application installation folders.\n    submitted by    /u/jwckauman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey All, \n I have just started a new gig working in a 99% Terminal Services Environment with the vast majority of users working off Windows 7/10 HP Thin Clients connecting via RDS to Windows Server 2016. \n Users are logging into Thin Clients with Generic Auto Logins and then authenticate via RDC to their sessions. This is problematic for new users because you can't change your password from RDC, at least not without making the process overly complicated by disabling NLA Server Side and a convoluted process client side with first tie logins using a secondary RDC shortcut with CredSSP disabled.\n I haven't worked in a shop that has had this problem, formally I was the IT manager for a mid size org and our TS were connected to from Windows workstations so users were already authenticated.\n The IT Manager's process has been to assign users passwords in the past and set them to not expire. Then he would communicate the password to the user or manager for login. Obviously this is 1. Not Secure, 2. Cumbersome as hell. 3. Several points of failure. \n This has been made more ridiculous by the fact that about 6 months ago they brought an MSP onboard who is now handling \"some\" of the user onboarding process including creation of AD accounts and they use a temp password as they should. But, now new users can't login. And my understanding is that new users have just been hijacking others accounts to get to sessions, creating security issues, profiles issues etc. \n My understanding is that the RDP Web Portal will resolve this issue, but I am honestly not familiar with using it and wanted to see if anyone had any input before I go suggesting this as the solution to the org. \n My understanding is that Users would connect to the RDP Web Portal via a browser where they would authenticate for the first time and be able to reset their passwords, and from there they would have access to their Terminal Services Sessions, is this accurate?\n    submitted by    /u/TheBlackAllen  \n [link]   [comments]",

That is actually less per hour than average Tier 1 Help Desk technicians make here (~$22/hr), if they work 60 hour weeks with overtime past the 40 hour mark (1.5x). Not to mention, $22 is starting rate.\n 40*22*52+20*33*52 = 80,080 > 80,000\n Basically if a Help Desk worker put in 60 hour weeks, they would be above SysAdmin for annual income, even if both were doing the same (60 hours). And Help Desk would be not needing to be on call at all. The only thing stopping this, is Help Desk managers restricting total weekly hours techs can work (in theory).

As many pointed out, this fell entirely in the realm of industrial engineering.\n A few days ago I made the company an offer. I would help restructure their processes with the help of 3rd party consultants, but I will not work IT at the same time. So they'd have to choose what full time position they want me to be in.\n After consideration they decided today that they wanted me to work full time on reimplementing their manufacturing processes and it would be very clear to the rest of the company that I am no longer IT and should not be approached regarding regarding any IT issue moving forward. This will take effect in 1-2 weeks.\n I then asked, so how will IT be handled when I'm moved off? How will we hire someone in time to learn and manage all the IT processes? They said that end-users will have to step up their game and figure out how to troubleshoot their own issues.\n I'm very excited. Not only do I get to tell end users \"not my problem anymore\" when the inevitable storm hits from IT being torn away, Im also betting they last no more than 2 weeks tops before they pull me off engineering and beg me to get back to handling IT.

Or if anyone else has dealt with the same issue they has a resolution to it? Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/CSDjs  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I'm a chicken and I feel too guilty to quit.\n I have been working non stop since July while the executives pat each other on the backs and congratulate each other on all the growth they've had. Including myself I have a team of 3. They have went from 300 people last year to 800 this year. Two helpdesk and me the \"IT manager\". Or should I say field tech/sysadmin/network engineer/helpdesk Tier 2/security.\n They have opened up 3 new branches and bought one company. They gave one week lead times for each to be set up. They have me traveling and staying overnight all over the state for these. They now want a network overhaul by thanksgiving for cyber insurance purposes and a new time keep software customized, tested, trained, and deployed before December. I'm working through nights days and weekends.\n Maybe I'm just not cut out for IT management. I've started having heart palpitations. I'm terrified every time my phone dings. I daydream every time I drive to work on crashing just to get a short break in the hospital. My temper and anxiety are 0 to 100 at the smallest problem. Maybe I should be a potato farmer.\n I was getting paid $50,000 a year at the beginning of the year. I've been in this position for 4 years. I demanded more money and they bumped me to $70,000 and promise to double my bonus making it 10 grand at the end of November.\n I'm trying to just get everything they want done and hang on to get my bonus.

After deployment, the sccm update system kicks in.\n The process of Bios firmware updates coming with Windows updates is detailed here:\n https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c07009542\n Strangely, I've never seen these bios firmware updates happen with updates pushed to clients over SCCM, even though the cumulative updates should be the same.\n Is anyone aware of a difference between cumulative updates pushed with SCCM and cumulative updates downloaded from the catalog, or of another process which might block bios firmware upgrades during the regular monthly update cycle?\n I don't necessarily dislike the update process over wsus if it takes care of bios passwords and bitlocker lockouts (which it seems to do) but I'd rather schedule it and inform the users if it would come in the regular monthly update cycle.\n The settings titled “Prompt for Admin authentication on Capsule Update” controls the password requirement for use with BIOS updates via UEFI Capsule.

          "description": "Probably a long shot, but would really appreciate any suggestions- \n I work for a training center that teaches MS Office applications, Windows, and some more technical classes such as SQL and Windows Server. Since all of our classes went virtual a couple years ago, I created a way of running the classes- I set up a Guacamole server to get the students into their lab PCs. We use GoToTraining for the classroom meeting. And finally we use Logical Operations for the courseware book & materials. \n This has worked ok, but it's a bit clunky giving the students 3 different things to log into. Especially for our more novice ones, it can be a hassle. Does anyone know of an off-the-shelf learning system that we could use to combine these things?\n    submitted by    /u/sirjimithy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We're going to shortly refresh our fleet of remote laptops by resetting Windows, configuring them with Autopilot and enrolling them with Intune for management. We currently deploy devices with MDT and are able to specify that the drive is Bitlocker encrypted with the requirement to unlock being that the TPM is present and the user uses a PIN. It doesn't appear that this is possible with Autopilot - there's no built in mechanism during the Autopilot process to prompt a user to enter a pin that would then need to be used to unlock the drive when they power it on. Has anyone found a way to achieve this?\n This has raised the question whether the additional protection of a PIN (alongside the TPM) is necessary to secure our remote devices. If we BitLocker our drives using the TPM only as the requirement to unlock it then the data on it is protected if the drive is removed and plugged in to another machine. Additionally, if the device is lost/stolen then the user will need Windows credentials to log in to the laptop and access the data on it. If we couldn't find a way to dynamically add a pin to our remote devices, are there any things I'm missing by using this as a secure solution? \n We want our data to be secure on our remote devices and up until now BitLocker with a TPM and a Pin has been how we achieve that. I guess my question is whether our data on remote devices is still considered to be secure (in the eyes of the industry and best practice) if we encrypt our drives using TPM only as the mechanism to unlock it.\n    submitted by    /u/Donatello0592  \n [link]   [comments]",

I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, \"The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term.\" Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don't need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. \n  \n Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place.

          "description": "Hello fellow redditors,\n I hope you are feeling great and have a nice and quiet day.\n Let´s get to the topic: Many of my users (including myself) have noticed a horrible decrease of performance for the whole system, as soon as one starts to share his/her screen on a Teams meeting.\n Everything takes way longer to open up and the whole system starts to feel some kind of unstable. Everything you click on has a high latency.\n We have allready checked the performance monitor on the computers. The only thing that was noticable was that Teams consumpts arround 15 - 30 percent of CPU usage (for a 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 as an example). Neither the SSD, GPU, RAM or other components seem to have a higher workload. It´s just the CPU, but anyway it´s by far not at 100% workload.\n I googled arround and found out that this problem seems to be well known for many people but nobody seems to have a solution for it.\n ​\n Does anyone else encounter the same behaviour of Teams or maybe even have a few hints for us or a solution for the problem?\n ​\n Thank you in advance!\n ​\n ​\n Edit// I forgot to mention that all of our computers at least have a 10th or 11th gen i7 with 16GB RAM and a m.2 ssd. \n    submitted by    /u/Sam751  \n [link]   [comments]",

Though he's trying to implement other solutions of theirs that they don't really excel at. Mainly for the reason of just having everything under one solution provider. I'm more of the mindset of choosing the best solution for that specific need (i.e. MDM, SIEM, AV, VPN).

I replaced one who had basically given up at the role and let things go well beyond unmanaged. I spent the first 6 months improving every process I could, and met every project I was given. After that I thought of a few projects that I could work on that didn’t require any budget changes, since anything involving a cost I get stonewalled on. \n But now it’s a year later, and as systems admin I still don’t have access to many of our systems. I don’t have access to our email spam filter. And when I’m on group calls involving my management I’m hardly given a chance to speak, and they do my work on the call instead of letting me, making me feel like I’m in some sort of placeholder position. \n Having the title longer on my resume is nice, and work/life balance and the pay is okay. But I don’t feel like I’m respected or trusted to have the tools to do my job here. \n It’s gotten to the point where I’ve begun collecting evidence of my requests that go unanswered, so if I’m ever terminated I can prove I didn’t have what I needed to succeed. Do you think it’s better that I stick it out for another year for that job history/resume experience, or should I look to leave as I’m really no longer learning or able to work on progressing my career here?

After I got into the field and started earning I slowly lost that focus. I mean I work really hard and focused at the office because I freaking love IT but I can't focus to study. \n I want to do a few certifications and even get my master's but sitting down and studying is like torture now. Even tutorials don't work. I get terribly (even intentionally) distracted all the time. I believe it's because we are so used to stimulation when we work in IT (screens, terminals, GUIs, incidents), our brain gets bored when we study. Does that make sense? Have any of you encountered this? How do you focus on studying for certs when your brain says \"nooooooo!\"? How do you get that 'student mindset' back and focus?\n    submitted by    /u/kavee9  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I guess this time I wasn't careful enough. \n The original mail seemed to originate from their web hosting provider stating a new invoice was ready for download and contained an HTML file as an attachment which should be the invoice itself. It was forwarded twice within their org, then to me with a request for credentials to access that site since it prompted for them. The website was an absolute perfect replica of the genuine login site and prompted for credentials. I filled it out planing to download the invoice and send it to them, since I knew the sender didn't have them. However the login didn't work. After checking the url I was on the correct site of the provider. What I didn't notice at first: I only got redirected there after entering the credentials. For some reason I got suspicious at that point and checked the HTML file which contained some encrypted java script. Of course I immediately changed the password of the account and fortunately found no suspicious activity. \n However I am still in shock how stupidly I behaved.\n Edit: just to add, that Mail did not trigger any spam filter nor did opening the HTML file trigger the antivirus or the webfilter of our firewall.\n Edit 2: just uploaded the file to Virustotal and it seems it's actually a trojan.

It seems to be a rather known issue that AD CS does not (sometimes?) clean up the ESE log files, for example:\n https://www.sysadmins.lv/blog-en/database-log-files-are-not-truncated-when-you-perform-a-full-certification-authority-database-backup.aspx\n The reference is contradicting itself. It says \"no workaround\" but also gives a command that \"identifies the start log file number to protect\". I had already figured out about as much by using esentutl but would like to confirm I am getting this right.\n In the above linked example all logs with sequence number smaller than 3B, meaning edb00001.log until edb0003B.log could be removed, right? What about edb.log, that one must not be touched? Or one cannot just delete any log file and have a working database?\n It should be rather simple to make a script that:\n  \nRun esentutl /mk edb.chk\n Parse the Checkpoint line for sequence ID\n Delete all edb#####.log files with ##### smaller than value from step 2\n  \nI have been searching for a while and could not find one website about actually doing this. Surely someone must have done this before, it does not even look that complicated?! Several hits for just brutely stopping certsvc and deleting all logs which is not what I want to do if this can be done \"right\", by just deleting unnecessary log files.\n I guess I could just download the whole CertLog and play around with it, see what happens.

So I made contact with the vendor who told me that the network guy needs to get his hands on the problem. The logs stated that also, at least the software ones. So I conceded and went back to troubleshoot even though I was pretty certain it´s not the network, most certainly not the server and probably not the software. It runs on several devices without any issues. \n After another sleepless night it dawned to me that the only difference is, that the software is installed on a HP desk. So I grabbed just another device, slapped the software on and it runs. It just does, what it´s supposed to do, it works. So it´s the HP trash again. Why? I don´t know. I wish I could say that every single HP device is in it´s own contained part of the network, isolated from the rest of the world and hidden from any tech guy but they are everywhere and the rules applied are the same as for all the other stuff. The one and only difference is, they are HP desks. \n I honestly don´t know who made the cost-benefit analysis or if there even is one, but I´d like to see which maniac decided to buy HP products.\n    submitted by    /u/Testnewbie  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now he bought a Fortigate with a FortiWeb (Reverse Proxy / WAF)\n ​\n Now we think about the Network Design.\n I thought about the following:\n DNAT from Fortigate to FortiWeb(WAF) into the DMZ\n Then FortiWeb has Default Route on FortiGate which then routes traffic to the Webservers, which are all on a seperate VLAN. \n ​\n Routing should work, but I have a feeling that SSL Offloading on the FortiWeb doesn't, since Session is being internally route and response comes back from different IP (Webserver). Can anyone confirm or entlighten me ?\n ​\n Thank you very much\n    submitted by    /u/No_Bumblebee_5793  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of the traffic engineering tasks is to route inbound traffic to my prefix in priority via Router A connected to ISP A.\n It is trivial on Router B connected to ISP A by prepending the as-path. But here's the tricky bit the ISPs have a peer-to-peer connection thus the local preference is lower than their provider-customer routes to me (reference). The local prefence over my route is 90 to their peer 40. I did prepend the path here just to see if it works.\n As far as I understood weight and local preference are evaluated first and the as-path is not taken into account so how do I overcome this?

With the risk of intercepting unencrypted data such as passwords etc.\n In today's world - would you consider this as much of a risk? My personal thoughts are:\n  \nL2 boundaries (such as VLAN with SVI) will limit what can be easily sniffed.\n plaintext data is a risk no matter what (should be wrapped or encryption).\n purely talking about sniffing of packets, not any other related attacks, the risks are minimal if everything is encrypted?\n  \nedit: I should mention my recommendation was for scanning the ip-ranges instead (as this would also allow for situations where devices are in another l3 network).

          "description": "I have a bit of a weird issue with a new deployment of a 9800 controller and capwap AP's. I had seen the occasional iPhone have an IP DHCP learning failure and not really causing huge concerns nobody was really yelling about it but was getting a little concerned as we move close to doing a mass deployment of a major building. It turns out from looking through some forums and then my own config I hadn't actually had the DHCP helper addresses on the SVI in question on the controller.\n Here's my problem, I don't know how any of the devices were getting thcp if there was no relay address configured. The only thing I can think is in the WLAN config I did have the IP of the DHCP server entered, but that's different than the helper address. So I'm a bit stumped as to why it ever worked, also why iOS seems to be the only operating system that felt any impact.\n    submitted by    /u/scarecrowandmrschuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

It doesn't happen every time nor with every phone, but they get it consistently enough that it seems to be on our end. Looking at some of the calls they have reported on in Mitel Connect Director, there seems to be a correlation of either a high MOL, high delay, or both with these calls, but I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this further, mainly because the site uses our organizations main PRIs and no one else has reported any issues with static. We had some issues with one of our PRI recently that were resolved, and I was hoping that might also resolve this, but the problem has persisted now for over a month. \n Is packet capturing the way to go? Are there any other methods to troubleshooting I should try or common causes for poor delay or MOL?

However, being that this is going to use AF VPNv4 and VPNv6 I don't see how I can just keep the next-hop unaltered nor how I could set this up. \n I can't just tell the network \"the next-hop is the loopback of core/dist-1\" like we currently do, since now the network is inside of a VRF\n Just to clarify, the anti-DDoS injects a route with a higher LPREF than the ones advertised by the core/dist switches at this moment, this causes the edge routers to prefer that one and apply policies based on the communities present on that specific one \n \n I have also concerns about scalability, we currently have ASR1004/1006 with RP2@16GB and receive full routing tables from prov-2 and prov-1, IXP routes from prov-3 and around 50k routes from prov-4 (and this is only IPv4)\n  \nOur equipment is a mix of Huawei CE68XX and Cisco ASR1004/1006. \n Any ideas, hints, or guidelines, especially if you have solved an issue like this before would be really appreciated.\n Regards,\n    submitted by    /u/shaoranrch  \n [link]   [comments]",

When this happens bandwidth at the firewall on our WNA interface and our LAN interface is both minimal, 4-5 mbps if now lower. The problem disappeared till it started again a few days ago. The ISP says something on our end is maxing out their AdTran 5660 CPU causing it to start discarding packets.

We have mostly used Cisco Meraki and Fortinet in the past so Juniper is not our strong suit but from what I can tell they seem to be setup correctly to handle broadcast storms etc., but I could be missing something.

On the one hand, we are obliged to use a firewall and requests from the Internet to the CDN service must pass through it. But should the return traffic go through the firewall? For example it might be possible that traffic from the Internet is only 1 Gbit/s, while outgoing traffic can reach hundreds of Gbit/s and it seems unreasonable to use firewall for outgoing traffic, because we trust our servers, plus we need a more expensive firewall. But on the other hand, if the return traffic won't pass through the firewall, the routing setup will be a bit tricky, plus we'll get asymmetric routing and so on...\n ​\n So, again:\n What is the best practice for deploying a firewall for a CDN service hosted on-prem DC?\n    submitted by    /u/istonru  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good afternoon,\n I work Helpdesk for a printer company and had an interesting situation that seems to be network related.\n The printer had a static IP, .0.24. I enabled DHCP, rebooted and it grabbed a 0.250 address (no APIPA). Also confirmed they were on the same Wi-Fi as the computer. The IP would not respond to pings and the UI was not reachable but the IP could be seen in an arp -a command. The MAC matched the printer. Typically, if you cannot ping it’s either on a different network or offline completely, and with this being visible in arp, a good Wi-Fi connection status and the printer rebooted, the only thing I could think would be to reboot the router. Any thoughts on what could cause this?\n Thanks very much!\n    submitted by    /u/TheTimelyTuna  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All,\n I'm a SrNE for a global biotech company and we've been running approximately ~2k+ C9300s spanning the globe for a few years now. Over the last 3 months we've been experiencing complete failures at a very alarming rate. We're currently running IOS-XE v17.3.5.\n Switch failures have occurred for various reasons, entailing:\n - PoE capability of switch death (Non PSU related).\n - Switches experiencing faulty boot flash requiring more RMAs.\n - Switches randomly bricking with no lights whatsoever. Just a complete and total death.\n - Switches randomly bricking and giving \"BOOT FAIL W\" error on console and non-recoverable. Can't even access ROMMON. Validated via Cisco bugID CSCwb57624, but not recoverable via power cycle/reload as noted in Workaround: https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb57624\n Further, after our team pushed Cisco to how unacceptable this has been, they came back acknowledging a potentially faulty batch of many of our C9300s with corrupted DIMM.\n Guys... In my 15+ years of networking and having managed C3750/3850s for the majority of my career, I've never experienced or witnessed anything like this from Cisco.\n For years now, I haven't been fond of the direction Cisco has taken their Catalyst platform with moves like axing Catalyst IOS, consolidating IOS-XE to catalyst hardware, and their continued merakification of Catalyst which lacks the tight integration needed for rock-solid stability (IMO). \n Cisco's moves have mostly felt more like cost-cutting measures than anything truly beneficial or innovative from an engineering standpoint. It's all giving me FirePower vibes which is why Palo is now dominating that market-space.\n Anyone else running C9300s in their environment at scale?\n Any failures?\n What software chain?\n I can't imagine our org is the only one experiencing this.\n    submitted by    /u/rndmprzn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mostly worked in places that couldn't afford or didn't need all those features and a new ISP that did a Juniper/Calix combo. FINALLY started working for an employer that has the scratch for Cisco with Palo Alto for Firewall.\n TL;DR: I'm very green on what Cisco hardware can and cannot do.\n We are getting tasked with stopping users from being able to communicate directly with each other within their same subnets. They only need to communicate with specific servers and cloud services.\n With Calix, I was able to use a protocol called Mac Forced Forwarding (MFF). In conjunction with DHCP Snooping and IP Source Verification, the switches forced all traffic to the gateway where a host was assigned via DHCP. My original thought was to use this and have the PaloAlto's regulate this traffic. Well to my surprise, these catalyst switches (9200, 9300 and 2960) do not have this feature. Seems to be limited to ISP grade switches.\n I tried using Switchport Protection (Private VLAN Edge) and this worked when the workstation where on the same switch. But it allows me to communicate to other workstations on other switches. While all of my access switches do trunk back 1-to-1 to the core switches. If I put those switch's uplinks into protected status as well, I might get what I need. Still \"testing\" this out. \n I'm also looking at VACLs but I haven't fully grasped the cisco mapping features yet.\n Can anyone give me some suggestions on how to tackle this requirement?\n    submitted by    /u/FireBean01  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have inherited a network where we have a single peering with an ISP using a private AS on our side. We advertise a single prefix (which we own) to them which they then advertise to the internet on our behalf.\n In RIPE, there is an empty ROA configuration where it shows the current AS numbers advertising the prefix (i.e. the ISPs AS) and we can just pick one and click to create an ROA to match. Private AS numbers do not show up here and cannot be configured as origins.\n I recently added an ROA to try and reduce the risk of a BGP hijack of our prefix. Shortly after creating the ROA, the ISP stopped accepting our prefix and of course it dropped off the internet. The ISP wasn't able to give much information as to why this happened but by removing the ROA, it came back up soon after.\n I'm assuming what happened is, the ISP had a filter on their router which looked up the ROA for our advertised prefix, saw it originating from a private AS which didn't match the ROA and then dropped it. Would that be normal behavior for an ISP? Would they not trust the private AS as they were the ones who provided it to us in the first place?\n Or is using an ROA just not possible where the originating AS is a private one?\n We do have a public AS that was recently assigned but have not started using it just yet.\n    submitted by    /u/Kslawr  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seemed to happen on the hour, and last about 5 minutes. Ping attempts during that time would timeout between offices. However, normal internet access was not affected - only the VPN tunnels. So what was the cause? After working with a couple of engineers at Meraki support, some suggested firmware upgrades and rollbacks (to no avail), we requested an escalation of the issue. After some analysis on their end, they discovered that the VPN Registry servers we were using were very busy. They changed our primary and secondary VPN registry servers. Since then, no more issues.

You can write a script that performs actions on a device or group of devices, and make intelligent decisions based on the CRUD responses. \n What about for network monitoring? API calls to devices can obtain much of the same information, if not more detailed information than SNMP MIBs can get - but how could they be worked into an operations environment? \n Most environments, mine included, have a number of monitoring tools. We use a combination of SolarWinds, DNA centre, Intermapper, and a few other methods. These systems poll devices every second (or several seconds) for new data. This is no different than the request/response format which would occur for API calls. \n  \n Are there tools built to utilize API calls to network devices? \n  Have any of you ever built a custom web application specifically to display their desired information in specific ways? I'm not an application or web developer by any means, so I can't speak to the complexity for a task like this, but I'm more looking into the need for something like this if there are existing commercial tools that do this already.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/MikeDeansMustard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good morning,\n I am having an issue with my native VLAN assignment for some reason and I am not sure why. I am very new to Aruba but worked with Cisco for a few years and most recently Alcatel-Lucent (unfortunately). The issue that I seem to be having is that at my branch location I have a newly deployed Aruba 6100 that sits in the IDF and connects via SM fiber back to the MDF. I have been using VLAN 100 for my native VLAN and my networking equipment all lives in that subnet. On the MDF side, I have my VLAN assignments set up like this\n BR-44-MDF> show vlan members port 1/1/49\n vlan type status\n 100 default forwarding\n 112 qtagged forwarding\n 164 qtagged forwarding\n 184 qtagged forwarding\n 188 qtagged forwarding\n 601 qtagged forwarding\n When I set my native VLAN on the Aruba switch trunk to match the MDF I lose connection to the switch and have to wait for the checkpoint to revert my changes back to the native VLAN being 1 before I can access the switch again. My trunk interface on the Aruba side is set up with \n Native VLAN: 1\n Allowed VLAN List: 1,100,112,164,188\n I also noticed that the Aruba switch VLAN 1 is pulling a DHCP address in the same subnet as my VLAN 100 address which surprised me that it didn't throw an error for overlapping subnets. \n BR-44-IDF# show ip interface brief\n Interface IP Address Interface Status\n vlan1 10.1.94.21/25up/up\n vlan100 10.1.94.125/25up/up\n I am not sure if I am missing something silly that I need to do in order to stop this behavior and have the VLAN 100 act as the native VLAN with a static IP instead of VLAN 1 with its DHCP-assigned IP. Any help in finding the piece I am missing would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/N3TW0RKJ3Di  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! I work for an MSSP and we have a customer sending Meraki logs to our SIEM - they have enabled FLOWS, which results in a \"flow\" type as well as a \"ip_flow_start\" and \"ip_flow_end\". The flow log contains more data than the start and end logs - it has the mac of the source, the outcome (allow or block)\n As far as I can tell, the only value of the start and end logs are calculating the elapsed time of a flow. However, there is no unique field that ties the two together, only the source and destination IP and port. \n I don't think the SIEM has any rules that rely on the calculation of flow length - so I figured I should just turn these off to save the customer some $ on data ingestion costs.\n Has anyone ever disabled just the flow start/end logs? In the interface there is only the Flows role. Googling this tells me the customer may need to engage Cisco support in order to do this?\n    submitted by    /u/Unreasonable_Yam  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've literally been trying for 2 months. We currently have 2 TRENDnet TFC-110 MSTs that link our two buildings together using fiber.

My Unifi switches recognize both SFP modules, but I cannot get the two switches to talk to each other with the fiber line that works just fine with the TRENDnet modules. Does anyone have ideas?

The two are exchanging their communication via TCP. \n I also did a vulnerability scan using GVM/OpenVAS and found out that the infusion pump is using an old/deprecated version of TLS (version 1.0).\n Now the data that is being exchanged is send in plain text (also a lot of sensitive data) despite TLS.\n I'm kinda new to networking and the whole security aspect that does with it so excuse my ignorance. However, shouldn't the data be encrypted in some sort because of the TLS that is implemented? The way i understand TLS is that the data is being encrypted right before it is being send over the TCP-Stream and then again decrypted at the destination.\n ​\n Any help is greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/godliketoni  \n [link]   [comments]",

Any input at all would be greatly appreciated.\n I am looking for a way to streamline some aspects of my job by doing some remote commissioning of PLCs, BACnet gateways, Modbus devices etc.\n While I am completing these works at the moment, the site is typically under construction, so there is no internet access or core switch operational. I have to manually plug into network switches around the the site and configure devices that way.\n I have got my hands on a cellular 3G router and have got it configured so I can use it to remotely connect to a site PC via RDP and use that for remote commissioning.\n What I would like to achieve is being able to plug this 3G router in to any isolated network switch on site and be able to connect to and pull data from devices such as the PLCs and gateways dynamically and communicate with a remote PC rather than a local RDP.\n Ideal setup would be:\n  \nRemote PC at home (192.168.xxx.xxx)\n 3G router plugged into switch on site (10.10.xxx.xxx)\n Applications on Remote PC at home able to communicate with IP devices plugged in to network switch on site (For example opening my PLC configuration program and plugging in the 10.10.xxx.xxx IP Address to be able to configure it remotely.\n  \nI have got the dynamic DNS side of things working and am aware I can set up specific connections via port forwarding, but I am looking for a more dynamic solution where someone on site can plug this router into any switch on site and I will be able to talk to any of the 10.10.xxx.xxx devices dynamically without having to set up dedicated port forwarding for each unique IP address.\n Is a solution like this feasible, or should I continue with the site laptop/3G router combo I am currently using for remote access via RDP?\n Appreciate your time and input.\n    submitted by    /u/Toasteroven47  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hoping to avoid a micro PC with two network ports: our setup is portable, people tend to yank power before worrying about shutdown sequences.\n Details:\n Broadcast is used for detection then multicast for actual communication, so both machines need to be on the same LAN to play nicely.\n They also use two realtime communication protocols at the same time, one protocol is nice and efficient, and the other one tries to hog the entire link to itself. The nice protocol uses IGMPv2 and the 236.0.0.0 range, the other protocol is a blackbox but uses 239.0.0.0 and opens ports 30000 thru 30007. I think if I could drop 239.0.0.0 and the associated ports I could solve my issues.\n I'm trying to add Point 2 Point wireless for long range comms using the lightweight protocol, but the heavyweight protocol seems to saturate the wireless bridge and the lightweight protocol can't connect. Everything works OK enough with Wifi 6 links, but I'm trying for hundreds of feet in a noisy environment, with TP Link P2P or Ubiquiti P2P limited to their 100Mbps ports. Upgrading to the 5ghz P2P stuff seems like kicking the can down the road, since at 15 feet away the heavyweight protocol is laggy over 802.11ax.\n Googling around brings me to articles about \"Packet Filtering Firewalls\", but without naming any devices.\n    submitted by    /u/JefeJeff  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is the cbs220 weaker hardware and performance wise compared to the c1000?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/shaulish  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have an office of about 100 people, but can grow to 200 when we have remote users in the office.\n ​\n Currently we have a very basic network. The only redundancy we have is our firewall which I believe I am going to upgrade to Palo, but maybe Fortinet. The current switches we have are simply access switches. SG500X switches that are not stacked. I have been pressing to upgrade the configuration and it may happen.\n Do you think some type of Collapsed Core implementation is overkill for this network?\n I have been looking at possibly going Aruba for core and access or do i keep the SG500X's and just get a 9200\n I am trying not to freak them out with pricing but now is the time to future proof some of our equipment so i have a good argument.\n Thoughts? Recommendations?

I know Ansible is not a programming language, however, I’ve noticed a lot of organizations that attempt to treat it as if it is. \n This post isn’t to crap on Ansible, I am genuinely curious why some of you prefer it. \n I am well aware that Ansible is written in Python, no need to iterate that point when most of us here are aware of that.\n    submitted by    /u/DifferentImplement45  \n [link]   [comments]",

We get a lot of trash at our doorstep....by that I mean port scanners and whatnot.\n But it's easy to enumerate IPv4. There's only so many IP's. 65,536, to be exact, in a /16.\n Is this such a problem in IPv6? We have a /40 and haven't started advertising any of it yet.\n There's a few more IP address in a /40 ( 309,485,009,821,345,068,724,781,056) than in a /16.

I was hired on by Dell before I finished my courses and decided to dedicate myself to their company. The job became fully remote and I started going nuts around 6 years. It was fun at first but man, I just need people around me. \n I had experience with network engineering from reading the bulky books but hardly anything was applied experience because I was hired on with Dell. I tried to segue into enterprise but even after years it was difficult to get in. I learn best by doing things, reading just doesn’t stick. I was outperformed by many who were smart as a whip. \n I’ve left Dell and landed a job at Charter/Spectrum - this is my first week. I feel totally lost as I’ve forgotten many things. I’ve been working on client computers for so long that it’s all I know. I plan to utilize the offers for CCNA and JDCNA to get back on my path but for now I’m focused on just kicking ass through my training. \n My main question is which areas to focus on in an enterprise tech support role here (I’m being trained on many things I don’t have experience with). The CLI for now is superputty and I’m trying to use my CMD and PS experience as much as possible. To be honest though I’m just a little intimidated. \n TLDR; Hired into enterprise customer support. Hoping for suggestions on what to learn after I clock out daily. I’m looking for network engineering or cloud admin areas. My new company doesn’t have 1x1 type meetings to assess career paths. I’ll read anything y’all suggest, thanks guys.\n    submitted by    /u/crushatx  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most providers are resellers and there are only a handful of providers who actually own the infra and source and host the proxies themselves.\n From my research these ISP proxy providers get IPs from ISPs and then host the proxies themselves for which they need both hardware and software. the IPs are already announced on the ASN of the ISP which gives them the ISP type IP.\n Now, I have some questions about these handful of providers.\n ​\n  \nWhat kind of hardware do they own? How is the hardware mapped and how does it work together?\n Does the ISP give them access to a server that the ISP owns with the bought IPs connected?(some B2B providers sell like this)\n Or, do they need to have their own servers and they lay the cables from the ISP datacenter to their servers and host the proxies there?\n What software do they use to host? Is it the normal squid for http/https and dante for SOCKS? I'd assume they write their own software. So,\n What is the prerequisite knowledge to write that software? I suppose its socket programming(correct me if I am wrong).\n Lastly, What is the cost of the hardware for hosting lets say a /20? Both one time and periodic costs.\n  \nI am sorry if my questions aren't specific, but I would be really glad if you all could answer them in detail.

Our Sophos SG is our internal gateway to all of our vlans so the Sophos XG will be the same. We would like to put the two in parallel so that we can slowly migrate a few vlans over at a time, but are struggling with the gateway/routes part.\n Without changing all our IP's and to keep gateways the same - are we best to create a new vlan exclusive for routing all traffic from the XG to the SG?\n For example we disable vlan 2 on SG 192.168.2.1, we then enable vlan 2 on the XG 192.168.2.1But our domain controllers and remainder of our environment is on the SG. So do we static route interface vlan 2 to the IP of the SG? How will it know how to process vlan 2 traffic if the vlan is turned off?\n Our aim is to pick one on prem application at a time and essentially test it before going live. And with everything live and in parallel we can log into the SG and Cisco ASA to compare rules and figure out where the config is incorrect on the Sophos XG.\n Any help or guidance would be appreciated.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/TrashAmbitious9083  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m guess this excessive amount of routes is due to their blended circuits with full bgp routes so I’m probably receiving all the prefixes with multiple paths and that’s the reason the prefixes are 2.7M ?\n Also in terms of memory will the ASR1001 non X edition support 16GB of ram (2x8 GB) or is it only 4GB sticks with a maximum of 8GB?

          "description": "I’ve been a little stumped trying to troubleshoot a site of mine. I’m an IT engineer, I like to think I’m not a complete n00b, I’ve successfully been in this field for 10 years I just neglected to learn some of the basics but do well at learning on the go. \n This site has 1GB single mode dedicated fiber coming in to the MPOE. We are currently, and temporarily, using an office space with existing infrastructure. They got CAT5E running to this MDF, into my Meraki MX100, and then back out over CAT5E into a Meraki 24PoE switch (can’t recall which model at the moment but can confirm ports are 1Gb compatible) and then to 4 Meraki MR42s. We are a commercial construction company, this site hosts our team as well as our subcontractors which are mainly an architectural firm and a mechanical/electrical/plumbing — aka high usage on full days (250gb up and down). The device connections are spread evenly across the WAPs. Channel utilization is also spread well. Users connected to the WAPs max on speed tests at 72mb. On these busy days there could be 30-50 users. I’m trying to understand how there’s so much loss to the user. I haven’t been able to test directly myself, but the ISP Claims their circuit test results at full speeds. Tests from my router max at 750mb. Tests from the switch max close to that. Tests from the WAPs max at 200mb. Again the user even on a light user day gets 72 — but on busy days they experience soooo much latency and I’m just… lost. I cant see where or why. \n Application usage in the dashboard shows normal activity, UDP or secure web, MS apps, AWS etc (lot of cloud storage, pretty much everything is SaaS). \n But I do wonder if the CAT5E is an issue. \n Can anyone provide some guidance on testing further or troubleshooting? Or validate my one and only theory? Thanks in advance and sorry for sounding like a network n00b. I promise I’m not a total beginner.\n    submitted by    /u/ThatOneTDGuy  \n [link]   [comments]",

This worked for HTTPS, but broke HTTP redirection causing the site to fail if you didn't specify HTTPS. \n Next, I thought AWS might work if we moved our domains there because they allow ALIAS records for root/apex domains, but after closer inspection it seems limited to only pointing to something else hosted at AWS. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html\n After a bit of a learning process, it's looking like the only real option to route ALL traffic through our WAF is to pay them to host our subdomains/root domains for us.

However, some networks have the requirement to route between each other, and some of these routes between VLANS consume a lot of bandwidth. For example Backups.

I am not a networking guy; I knew that it would not be as easy as plugging the switch in an it would work immediately - but I also didn't realize that I needed to build an operating system to make it work At the moment I have a $10,000 door stop; I have cloned the onie repo and attempted to build for Mellanox and then I started working through issues (this library isn't installed, that tool isn't installed..) for about 1.5 hours before reaching an error indicating that I should not be a root user, but then nothing works unless I am root so...?? In looking through the onie repo the SN2100 isn't even listed as supported hardware and it hasn't been updated for 5-8 years. \n Is there an image on the switch that works somewhere, or is this something that everyone has to deal with? How do I get an OS that is made for the switch and works properly?\n It seems crazy to me that a company would sell a product that is so expensive and then just have a pointer to an open source project and not even say \"good luck, have fun! lol\". :(\n    submitted by    /u/Wild_Doctor3794  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've used this setup before and it's easy with everything else I have running. Right now, it's all wired. \n My question is: if that were to be shared on open wifi instead of ethernet, what dangers to the host/\"main\" network would there be?\n I know that if I were using a normal router for this, I'd be concerned they would navigate to 192.168.1.1, enter a correct password or bypass an insecure login page, and wreak havok. So I would know that I need a secure router and a good password or I could put management on another VLAN. \n I'm aware of possible concerns about peer security. Client isolation will be enabled in the access point to this network. \n What concerns are there with Windows ICS \"acting as the router\"?

For the last two years our data closet has sat gathering dust, and I got fed up with a perfectly good 80TB of shared storage sitting unused. So I took a photo of all the various serial numbers, brute-forced the passwords (they were all the defaults - go figure), and bought the company’s first PC to see what I could do.\n Here’s a list of the equipment on our rack from top to bottom: - D-Link DGS-1210-16 (not connected to anything) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “LAN”) with cat6 cables running to stations - HP1920-48G network switch (labeled “LAN S”) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “PHONE”, the phones and their breadboard-looking-box have been removed) - CISCO Catalyst switch (Labeled “PHONE S”) - NETGEAR ProSafe XS712T switch (with one fiber expansion port, connected via fiber to NAS, and Ethernet to LAN, second NAS) - 24-port RJ45 patch box with mix of Cat 5e, 6, and 6e ports that run to CAT7 cables to edit stations - Synology DS1618+ - Synology DS3617xs\n My goal is to get an office network up and running with the CAT7 lines running 10Gb to edit stations and Cat6 lines running 1Gb to producers stations. From there, I want to host a server for Signiant Media Shuttle that will allow my NAS both through my router’s firewall and to the office network. I presume this means it all has to go through either the 10Gb or 1Gb switch (or both?). My office has 1Gb fiber through Verizon, and we have their router.\n If anyone out there has any advice for me, or can point me to good resources, I would greatly appreciate it.\n https://imgur.com/a/EaComxr\n    submitted by    /u/ReelBack96  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I started a new job and in a process of modernizing my network. The current network is a huge layer2 domain. The customers are in R&D and use a lot of multicast and broadcast. I am planning to turn this network into layer3 since 90% of our traffic is east-west. I am thinking to implement the spine-leaf topology. And utilize vrf-lite for each customer. My network is spread between five different buildings. The farthest building is probably 3000ft away from the main one. Also, the fiber between buildings is either OM1 except for the farthest one.\n It seems like I am going to be using Cisco C9300 and C9500 (or maybe 1u Nexus switch)\n  \nCan I use C9300 as leaf switches?\n Can I use C9500 for my spines?\n  \nI am thinking to deploy a couple of leaf switches to each build. I am not sure if this is a good idea or not. My understanding of the spine-leaf network, the vrf-lite exists only at the leaf level. If I have a tenant that happened to be located at two different buildings, the tenant's VLANs will be extended via vxlan / l2vpn. Am I right about this? Does the VLAN in bldg A need to match the VLAN ID in bldg B for the same tenant?\n Also, I am still wrapping my head how the routing between tenants. Since each tenant will be placed in a vrf-lite, then I would have to use route-leaking. Do I need to create an ACL on the leaf switches if the traffic between tenants must be restricted based on their applications (e.g. ssh, ftp, etc.) only?\n For my infrastructure, servers (AD, NTP, DNS, DHCP, ISE etc), Docker containers, end-users, and oob (ipmi and network management), should I put these on their own vrf-lite or should I put them on the master/default table? What is the best practice for infrastructure?\n ​\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/forwardslashroot  \n [link]   [comments]",

The client has an available public IP in their static block. I configured the client firewall to use one of those static IPs and Im trying to think of the best way to set up this handoff. Current set up below:\n Coax > Modem > Ethernet > Router > Ethernet > Firewall. \n The connection from the ISP router to the firewall is connected to one of the ISP router's switch ports. My opinion is its probably best to plug the VOIP provider's device needing a public IP directly into one of the other ISP router's switch port.

Yay.\n I'm trying to determine if \"old\" fibre is perfectly fine if it still works. You either get a 1Gbps connection or you don't - or - signal degradation and packet loss could mean a functional connection with a seriously low maximum capability even though the link is established at 1Gbps.\n What happens over time? 5 years, 10 years, 15 years? Does the capability of the medium degrade and lose performance? Do you get \"indicated\" 1Gbps right up until the point where you get no link? Do you get indicated 1Gbps but no where near the 1Gbps throughput and packet loss? \n It's been quite hard to search for the answer, and I think I'm just using the wrong search terms, or this isn't widely discussed. \n ​\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/b_muz  \n [link]   [comments]",

We've kept default settings mostly, no firewall but no ports being forwarded, except 22 for ssh which goes to a DMZ and then to the pi. 443 and 80 take you to the gateway login screen.\n First question: Does having no firewall matter if we're not forwarding any ports? Surely traffic just dies in a slightly different way?\n And much more importantly:\n Am I going to get DDoS'ed on port 22 any day now? /var/log/auth.log shows failed connection attempts every few minutes. The root account has a complex password with timeouts per attempt, so I'm not worried about access, but is it only a matter of time before some more ambitious bot discovers an open ssh port serving password attempts and has a thousand computers a common password dictionary on me? Or some Russian hackers take me down just so they can pretend I'm a drone bill the KGB?\n If yes, is the way to be safe to close down all ports and use openvpn to gain access? (This sucks because we'd like to access our gateway if the pi goes down). Or could I geo-lock access and save myself? \n But at the end of the day, even if the gateway is set to deny all requests except ones from my own ip address, couldn't someone DDoS the firewall?

My question is specifically with Juniper vs Cisco: route preference vs administrative distance?\n Still working on the details, but as of now we have branch office router seeing two default routes one in IGP OSPF and another in BGP. One of the default routes is for internet access and the other from corporate (Incase the internet default goes down).\n The branch router runs IOS-XE, Corp device is Juniper, and the internet default comes from a Palo-Alto FW.\n Our Juniper rep has said to change Cisco’s AD values to match theirs and guess what our Cisco rep said the same thing for Juniper!

There is some electric interference present around them (120V) but these are 600V rated Cat6 cables. Since they are 600V rated, they are very bulky. Customer suggested us that the weight of the cables could be causing the issue at the switch. I find that difficult to believe since only 4 out of 60 Cat6s are acting up.\n I am thinking as a first step of troubleshooting to re-terminate both ends for the cables.

For the ISP Connections... They are going into Ports that are tagged as VLAN 17 & 18 .... And the Firewalls are connected to more ports that are also tagged as VLAN 17 & 18 ----- Does this mean that the Internet is \"piping into that first port\" and then any other ports that are tagged as 17 / 18 ... are automatically getting blanketed with that ISP connection (Just like how an unmanaged switch works)? And Thus.... in the Eyes of the Firewalls, the Firewall's WAN Port just thinks that you took the Ethernet cable from the back of each Modem... and plugged it straight into the Firewall?\n In all my years of experience with networking, I have only ever seen the chain look like this:\n ISP Modem >>> Firewall >>> Core Switch >>> Smaller Switches >>> PC's / Printers / AP's / Etc\n So the fact that this job is setup backwards (in my eyes) as:\n ISP Modem(s) >>> Core Switch >>> Firewall >>> Smaller switches >>> PC's / Printers / AP's / Etc ---- And the fact that I am a Cisco novice lol...

But my question is, is there a way to create a default route in azure to send all internet destined traffic to my palo alto vm that is internet facing? Furthermore, is there a way to advertise that same default route and advertise it to a downstream spoke via eBGP, in this case OCI assuming that the eBGP peering is already in place between the two clouds. Would I perhaps need an azure route server , and pass this default route from my palo vm via ebgp, so that azure/oci internet traffic all goes out of the internet interface of the palo vms?\n    submitted by    /u/BlueberryThick  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am extremely novice to the Python world but was recently assigned a task of doing data collection on around 100 IOS switches so it’s not very feasible to manually SSH to all of them and run show commands, nor should it be. I need this done by the end of the week which is why I am trying to use this script that’s already published as I know I won’t have time to learn from the ground up by then.\n Anyways, I am not having issues running the script, I am able to run it fine and it “works,” but the account I have for access needs to pass the enable password which this script doesn’t account for, so whenever it tries to create a new file using the host name via ‘show running-configuration | i host name’ it just ends up not naming the files with a host name like it’s supposed to, and overwriting them because I can’t view the running config with my account. I have been trying for a couple of hours to modify the code to allow the enable password, but I just can’t seem to figure it out. I was able to create a very basic script and use net_connect.enable() which worked for passing the enable password, but was only ran on one device and didn’t export the output to a file which is needed. After I was able to get that working, I tried adding that bit and the enable password into the ShowCollector code in multiple different areas, but ultimately couldn’t get it to work, and now I am stuck on where to add the parameters which is why I am here lookin to get some pointers/ideas on where to look! \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Littleboof18  \n [link]   [comments]",

Trying to determine which port it was plugged into, I ran: show mac-address on the switch and it showed that the device was connected to the trunk port, so I SSH'd into the switch that the trunk port runs to (SW01) and ran the same command, it came back showing that the MAC was attached to port 3 which is the trunk port that runs to SW02.

          "description": "Hello fellow network nerds! :-) For many years I have been helping to send out RIPE Atlas measurement probes (world's largest open Internet measurement platform) in the US - initially a few hundred as IPv6 deployments happened. There are currently ~1,400 active probes in the US. But with some newer ISPs there are gaps that would be cool to fill - initially newer ISP connections like Starlink and 5G fixed wireless (TMo & Vz). (Next year maybe some rural FTTH ISPs.)\n In my day job[1], I just renewed our RIPE Atlas sponsorship which gives me another block of probes to deploy. If you might be interested in hosting a probe on your connection, I am guessing I will have probes be able to ship them in about a month (given the upcoming IETF meeting starting this weekend). Once you receive a probe, it connects to your network via Ethernet and you will need to use the RIPE Atlas site to activate the probe – which is about 5 mins work.\n If you might be interested, please PM with the following info: Your first & last name, your shipping address, and your email address for probe activation process.\n Don’t know what RIPE Atlas is? See https://atlas.ripe.net/ \n Thanks! Jason\n [1] Day job is at Comcast where I work on Internet measurement and new standards and lots of other good-of-the-Internet sorts of stuff. This RIPE Atlas system is run by RIPE NCC - all I am doing is facilitating distribution of probes in the U.S. Here's a somewhat recent paper I co-wrote about Internet measurement: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372135.

Why does a connection get a fraction of the transmission capacity? This makes no sense to me.\n In the TDM, you're switching between circuits, but the speed of the link doesn't go down based on the number of active circuits. But I guess you could argue that the transmission rate is reduced since you're not sending data when the circuit switched from you to others, so it's a if the network is slower, but when you're sending data, you're sending it at full speed possible by the link. But I don't understand why a 1Mbps link is quartered to 250kbps if there are 4 circuits? Or is this saying the same thing I said, it's a if the link speed is reduced?\n In the FDM, this makes completely no sense to me. You're dividing the spectrum, but you're sending stuff in parallel and at full speed just with its own bandwidth. No?\n    submitted by    /u/Jastibute  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently in the last chapter on Network Troubleshooting, on the section ipconfig/ifconfig/ip. He shows an example of the macOS/UNIX ifconfig output, and on the inet line it says:\n  \ninet 192.168.4.78 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.4.255 \n  \nI'm just wondering why does the netmask show in hex and not dotted decimal or CIDR notation? Wouldn't it normally be written as 255.255.255.0 or /24? \n This seems to be specific to the ifconfig output, as ipconfig shows the subnet mask with dotted decimal notation, and ip shows CIDR notation. This is the first time I've even seen a hex netmask, as literally the rest of the book has used dotted decimal or CIDR notation. Even in my limited real world experience troubleshooting computers and networks, I've never seen a hex netmask.\n I've tried Googling the answer, but most of what I found was just decimal to hexadecimal conversion charts, or talking about hexadecimal in a general sense not really networking focused. From what I read I think it might just be a remnant of the early mainframes and UNIX systems, and the language they ran on. But I can't find anything definitive about it. \n I don't think it ultimately matters what notation the subnet/netmask are written in, but I am I wrong is there some system out there where I'll need to know how to convert binary to hex for subnetting?\n    submitted by    /u/StJerneJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

Clients get a static IP address and our routers/firewalls etc are configured to (dis)allow those clients to the backends. So basically, every client can get an ACL list attached to it. \n But now we are going full into Azure. Since the Azure VPN gateways only give out dynamic IP addresses our current setup can't be transferred to native Azure VPN's. \n I've seen that Cisco has the CSR 1000V in Azure, but I can't find anything regarding static IP addresses (or pools) in the documentation. So, I'm not sure if this would fix our \"issue\".\n Does anyone have an idea on this issue? I'd rather not deploy a VPN gateway for each set of users. ;) I'm also not tied to Cisco btw.\n    submitted by    /u/necrofrost76  \n [link]   [comments]",

It works at 10Gb fine to the above Switch using a non-25Gb (SFP+) cable, but as soon as an SFP28 cable is used to that Switch, it doesn't show a connection on either end (NIC or Switch). However, using a regular SFP+ cable, both work fine. And the SFP28 cable works in a different NIC entirely connecting at 10Gb, so the cables are fine. And the NIC itself is fine, since it works at 10Gb perfectly fine (and once at 25Gb fine (I even took a screenshot to show a coworker we were finally at 25Gb internally)).\n However, I'm at a loss at what could cause it no longer working, especially when neither the NIC or the Switch is showing any sort of connection using SF28 a cable. And ESXi shows the connection as \"Down,\" of course.\n And the server is fairly brand new, so I know it has plenty of PCIe lanes to absorb and plenty of empty PCIe slots to use up since dual-CPU server. I think I tried slot 5 and 7 in the server. It initially worked that one time on slot 5 (I think it was in riser 2?), but stopped after a few hours.\n Multiple cables, multiple manufacturers (10GTek coded for Cisco (initial); Macroreer coded for Intel (last resort)).\n Dell will obviously not assistance since the card is aftermarket, but I have 2 and both are doing the same thing in this same server.\n Link for proof it DID work <once>: https://imgur.com/a/33jBzsH\n Any sort of assistance/direction would be greatly appreciated, as I'm clueless at this point.\n    submitted by    /u/marvin83  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys, first of all I'm not a high-level networking engineer, far from it actually, but I know my way around most of the stuff we need to do, and as a lone sysadmin I kind of have to.\n We recently migrated to Nutanix and along with the nodes we got ourselves a pair of new Alcatel OmniSwitch OS6900 TOR switches. Tricky ones to manage, but solid. \n Our old server rack will be decommissioned but our old TOR switches are not that old at all, they're a pair of HP FlexFabric 5700s. Our core switch, on the other hand, is a VERY old HP 5406zl, with rapidly dying PoE ports and a general feeling that the whole thing is going to die soon as well. Switches are still hard to find, so getting new ones would take at least 6 to 10 months. \n So, in the meantime, I'm thinking about replacing the 5400 with the 5700.\n Now, when I say \"core\" switch I do not actually mean it, it's by all intents and purposes an access switch: no l3, no gateway, no nothing. All routing is done through the firewall. All it has connected to it are clients, and a trunk to the TOR switches.\n We would not hit any of the limitations of the 5700 (i.e. the 1024 entry arp-table) but we would gain a healthy new switch.\n Yet, since I constantly doubt myself, I'm asking Reddit: am I missing something here?\n    submitted by    /u/camazza  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have maintained the solution with a very basic level of Cisco knowledge he passed on. We are looking at replacing the devices before we face an outage and are scrambling. We are trying to find a more user-friendly solution that still does the job and thus I seek advice.\n Currently, we have two Cisco 1811 in a data center. Our needs are fairly simple and I have been told in the past we can replace both with a single device these days. We have an Incoming device that has VPNs to the providers and contains all the traffic from field devices. That is connected to the second outgoing CISCO directly and then routes traffic via VPN to various clients based on which devices are theirs.\n Traffic to the internet is restricted with a few exceptions, some IP based, some port-based.\n What replacement device would best meet my needs? Preferably something with a GUI interface instead of the CISCO command lines. \n *edit to add some details*\n My concerns are really just about the two routers into one or needing two.\n At present, I have some IP routes for each client VPN, like below.\n ip route 10.232.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2\n ip route 10.232.24.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2\n ip route 10.232.32.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2\n I also have to NAT everything from one provider's VPN to the client VPN.\n ip nat inside source static 10.232.128.200 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n I don't really care about the brand, just function and something a bit more user-friendly for a fairly entry-level of networking knowledge.\n    submitted by    /u/jlarmour  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently I had a Cisco AP (3802i) swapped out for an Extreme Networks one (AP250) trying to test something. Got the Extreme AP connected and it connected back to XIQ fine. AP reported that there were several clients connected to it and I figured everything was fine. Turns out things were not fine as the clients (primarily iPads) now consistently disconnect from wireless. Some flat out drop off Wifi and say \"Cannot connect to X network\" or that they can't connect to the Internet and other times they appear to be working but with low signal strength. I think they're going from the Extreme AP to a Cisco one that's in another room across the hall from where the Extreme AP which is really odd since that Cisco AP appears to have really weak signal going into that room. \n ​\n The same SSIDs are configured on both Cisco and Extreme with the same VLANs being attributed to both. We use the same model of Extreme Network APs in another building and they work fine. My guess is that the clients keep trying to connect to the Cisco AP instead of the Extreme but I'm not understanding why when the Extreme AP should have better signal strength vs the Cisco one. I know mixing APs from different manufacturers isn't really ideal but this was the only room where we made this kind of swap.\n    submitted by    /u/BuffaloOnAMotorcycle  \n [link]   [comments]",

Its a temporary network, so speedy deployment is important, using UBNT will help with that.\n Below is my initial plan and looking for feedback if this will produce a stable enough network: \n There are two floors in play here (F1 & F3, F2 is not used/not part of this) \n Floor 1\n - Room 1: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP\n - Room 2: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP\n - Room 3: 128m2/40 people, 1 AP\n - Attrium, 1600m2, 300 people, 6 AP \n Floor 3\n - 4 rooms of each ~100m2/50 people, 1 AP each \n Total: 13 APs, probably order a few extra to fill in potential gaps. Probably will we rent the equipment. \n People have one or two devices, so I probably need a /22. Disable client-to-client communication, to limit broadcasts/ARP-traffic on the network. Alternative would be to split it in smaller subnets, but people will roam around, so I think that is not convenient. \n Build up time, 1-2 days.

I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, \"The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term.\" Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don't need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. \n  \n Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place.

In order to access it I have a USB stick that acts as a network license. It is plugged into my PC, my PC sees it, and when I open the software it checks to make sure before allowing access. I pay for a few seats of these software, all of which run through the USB network license. It maintains count of how many people are accessing it.\n I have a few remote employees who VPN into my network. In order to access the software they change a few settings in the SKM files per their (SKMs) direction, log into the VPN, and it sees the license, good to go. Except one employee.\n For some reason this one employee cannot \"see\" the network license once he is logged into the VPN. I went over to his house, brought my laptop, connected to the VPN, only to have the same issue. My laptop could not \"see\" the license either. \n I have spoke at length with SKM about the issue and have tried every recommendation on their end. They have simply chalked it up to some network issue, which I'm beginning to agree with after troubleshooting. \n The license uses something to check and i go to localhost:1947 to check. Not sure what this changes, just stating it as a fact. I've tried looking into the network adapter settings, etc. but I really don't know if what I do will help as I'm not that informed on networking issues. \n For the record, server side and user side firewalls are all off. Other employees do not have this issue, and neither do I when I am remote from my main office location.

There's a whole bunch of other stuff happening with it (like how I can't ping any VSI - even if they're up) but the most baffling to me is that I can't ping the loopback address at all. \n It's a Cisco 3850 stack with 7 members. 1 master, 1 standby, and 5 line cards. I have Loopback0 configured with an IP of 10.0.255.4 and no matter what, I cannot ping it. Even if I console into the router and use \n ping 10.0.255.4 source Lo0 \n it times out. Isn't the loopback supposed to be working, even if nothing else is? All it has is the ip address command in its config. \n Additionally, I can't ping ANY VSI on the device, even though all of them are up. We have a few dozen and they've all been working as expected, but starting this morning we can't ping any of them. Here's an example :\n  Interface Vlan148 ip address 10.0.148.1 255.255.255.192 no ip redirects no ip unreachables no ip proxy-arp  \n There's also some netflow commands but they're long and I didn't really feel like typing them out. I doubt they're relevant. \n Anyway, a computer under Vlan148 (148.17) cannot ping its gateway (148.1) yet it DOES have full access to the whole network internal and outbound. I'm completely lost. \n Even more weirdly, the device (when console'd in) can't ping anything itself, yet still sends SNMP logs, registers devices in the arp cache, creates OSPF neighbor entries, etc. \n This is just so strange. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n EDIT: Partially resolved the issue. Turns out VRRP was causing this somehow, as disabling the VSIs that use VRRP fixed the issue. Tomorrow I'll have to figure out why exactly VRRP did this, but for now, it's resolved.\n    submitted by    /u/scp-507  \n [link]   [comments]",

New data center connection to the world would be gigabit, so plenty of bandwidth there.\n Do people still typically leave behind a DC and a NAS? Nothing but a firewall? Direct connect? We run light SQL loads, AD and VOIP, that's about it. There are two other corporate offices in the US connected via site-site VPN and the other sites are OUs in Active Directory. In each site, there is a physical DC as well as virtual on esxi - and esxi obviously hosts all of our servers in each site. There is no shared storage for esxi, it's all local to each site. Considering moving to RD Gateway model for the users who have been used to local LAN speeds for all applications as some are a bit rough via WAN (such as document management).\n Thanks for any ideas!\n    submitted by    /u/Budget-CaterpillarJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Okay, I think this is a straightforward question. I have a location in my EIGRP WAN topology with a secondary WAN link. I want this secondary link to advertise the LAN networks learned from the local L3 LAN switches, but I want to use the reliability metric at this duel circuit location to make routes advertised from the secondary links a feasible successor. \n All Routers in the EIGRP WAN are only configured to consider the Default metrics (BANDWIDTH/LOAD) when calculating the best path.\n Now, describing this in writing has already made me feel like the answer is \"no\" because the other EIGRP neighbors would not use this new metric when calculating the best path. It may make more sense to modify the LOAD metric. I think this would mean the routes may not be installed as feasible successors, but they would be used if the primary Router failed. \n What are your thoughts and ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/Skaffen-_-Amtiskaw  \n [link]   [comments]",

The team did their testing, PVT passed and they left for the day. Staff started moving in the next day. I then get a P2 the next day, site down, I can't login, and everything down.
