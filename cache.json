These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber actors’ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.\nOT/ICS devices and designs are publicly available, often inco…",

          "description": "Hello\n I've been following this sub for a while but I have never posted anything.\n I request the help of a good soul to understand :) \n Let me detail the situation : I am currently building a game server with i9 10850k and I am looking for a motherboard. I have choosen one, the SuperMicro X12SCA-F (pictured here) but I have some questions about adding a 10 GB network card on it.\n I have already an ASUS NVMe PCIe x16 Card, which allows me to add up to 4 NVMe Drives (4 x 4 x 4 x 4 lanes) destined to be mounted on the first PCIe slot (X16).\n Consequently, the 2nd PCIe x16 slot will be disconnected. Which leaves me one PCIe x4 Slot.\n I have found this Intel x550 T1 PCIe 3 x4 that seems to be ok to pair with, but I have 2 questions before I click to buy it :\n 1 – How will a NIC plugged on this slot affect the latency of my internet connection since it is linked to the MB chipset (PCH) and not directly to the CPU ?\n 2 – Is this slot shared with the M.2 slot or anything else ? In other words, do I have to expect some troubles or bottleneck from using this slot for my purpose ?\n Thanks a lot for your reply! \n    submitted by    /u/10yrs_to_the_day  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far, after checking my options, I'm leaning towards a solution including a VPN (probably OpenVPN over Wireguard due to the firewalls), Guacamole, and a Let's Encrypt autorenewal system to SSL' the whole thing.\n Process would be : connect machine A to VPN, use Guacamole on VPS, use VPN on VPS to connect to machine A.\n I'm now pondering what would be the best solution to handle this - and I like Docker quite a bit. So I'm asking here if there is a \"full solution\" already available for Docker (for what I searched, it's always \"bits\" : either there is VPN + Guacamole, either Guacamole + LetsEncrypt, etc. but not the whole thing), if I should install it on the machine without Docker, or if I should make my own Dockerfile.\n This is considering I want to set up some OTP (at least) to guard the thing off.\n What do you guys think?

I was following one or two guides I found on the internet.\n Turns out, internet outdates way too quickly. A test cert I issued to a website got outright rejected by Google Chrome (with no option to move forward) despite having the whole cert chain imported to my system. \n I ran a cert lint tool on the certs using online (https://crt.sh/lintcert) tool, and it spew out so many errors, I was questioning my ability as a sysadmin. \n I won't go into details of what the errors are since they are pointless at this stage. But stuff like mandatory Subject alternative names, and the abolishment of CNs, requirement for policy extensions, are some of the few things that have changed over the past few years, and none of the guides I used bothered to address any of this either.\n Hence, my question is, do any of you guys have a good reference guide that I can follow to create an internal CA the way the internet overlords intended in the current day and age, since apparently all the guides I have followed on the internet are all very much outdated. \n And yes, I am aware I can bypass these warnings by manual adding to chrome, and using secret codes or whatever, but remember that this is going to be used in a real production environment so such work arounds are not a permanent solution. \n P.S.

(Mainly think that is because some job job descriptions are far more broader than you actual responsibilities, if I saw SQL database, I would assume I needed to be a SME)\n Now I have gained some pretty desirable skills (such as PowerShell, Microsoft 365 expert, Cloud knowledge, etc) I went for a £50k role with no hesitation, it will be challenging but in a good way.\n And I feel like I will be far more motivated knowing I am getting a salary worth my knowledge, skills and experience.\n I also have been offered contract work on the side, which I’ve always felt IT was hard to side hustle.\n But my PowerShell and modern workplace knowledge has been very desirable as of late. All that training paid off!\n So this post is just to say… go for it, as long as you are willing and train when required, maybe that role your eyeing up will work for you.\n Wish me luck!\n    submitted by    /u/KrustyYeti  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I hope you could help with my issue:\n I have to update the company's DC so I did set up a a new DC with Win2022 as secondary DC, joined to the AD forest, and make sure the replication of AD Sites and Services, DNS, and GPOs were fine. The old one is a Win2012, I kept both running for a while, until I had some free time to decommission the old one.\n Finally, today I did transfer all the FSMO roles to the secondary DC make it as primary, the old DC is hosting the DNS server as well, so I added the new DC to each Forward Lookup Zone FQDN and changed the DNS in the network settings pointing our AWS Route53 (which I don't manage). At first, until the old DC was online and after I transferred the FSMO roles, all the clients and workspaces were able to resolve the new DC as DNS server, the group policies update correctly, everything looks fine. \n Unfortunately, after I shut down the old DC, the new DC could not resolve out domain and lost the all the metadata it replicated before. Starting back the old DC resolved the issue, and everything went back to normal.\n Now I don't know what exactly where the issue is, I suspect this is something to do with the DNS but I really don't know what I missed.\n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/FedeDost  \n [link]   [comments]",

We could run them in a hypervisor, but then we'll need to duplicate the data into the VM and double our storage. \n Qsync in QuTScloud would let us host a QNAP OS image in Hyper-V for a reasonable price per year but would also require us to duplicate our storage in the VM which means double the costs for hard drives. \n Is there someone I'm missing who works with Windows Server and doesn't have crazy enterprise rates assuming that 80TB will only ever be needed by multinational corporations?\n    submitted by    /u/im_thatoneguy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Haven’t been in IT for too long and I am heading a small project to replace two drives in a customers server with larger ones. \n I email our dell distributor and say hey let me get two 4TB drives for an R410. He sends them over and I pop them in the server. Get into the configuration utility and it isn’t recognizing the drives. It is showing the drives as failed. \n I think that’s crazy that he sent me two failed drives but hey anything can happen. He sends me two more drives and boom those both say failed. At this point I get a supervisor involved after I try everything with the drives I can think of. \n He takes one look at it and says, “Those are SAS drives and this server uses SATA. You got the wrong drives”\n Facepalm…….\n A quick google search reveals that you can use SATA with a SAS connector but not the other way around. A lesson I will never forget! \n Luckily the customer wasn’t in a rush and my supervisor was cool about it besides laughing at me lol but I kinda deserve.

Instead, they direct you to ask a Certified Partner. \n I wish they just said \"The API needs to write/read the mailboxes using EWS with OAuth authentication\" or really any indication of the required function/permissions.\n ​\n So, if you're trying to set this up: \n  \nInstall at least TM 16.6\n Create an Enterprise application in Azure, create a corresponding client secret\n Verify that OAuth2 is enabled for the tenant\n You need permissions for the API to Exchange Web Services using full_access_as_app\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/how-to-authenticate-an-ews-application-by-using-oauth#configure-for-app-only-authentication\n Reconfigure the Exchange sync on the server with the API values and verify the connection\n \n Hope this saves someone else some time.

Exchange online has a 'Compliance Manager'. Does that play a role? Any guidance on getting written policies is greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/MyITDirector  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All\n We had an elaborate phishing breach. Led to nothing but will lebaorate on what they did and I want advice of what else we can do, or even buy to help reduce. We are a MS 365 house\n ​\n  \nUser in question is in finance.\n User was recently scammered personally.\n User was tricked (we suspect she may have been using same passwords for everything) to approve MFA. MFA was set as phone. The initial entry point we think they either had tested her password as got from the initial, non company scam or a phshing email pre Avanan being turned onto the max and slipped through MS quarantine.\n Scammer got in (using a IP on same country) and set a rule for correspondance on a \"shared finance mailbox\"\n 2 weeks later...logged in and started correspondance with a cutsomer as set in the rule about bank details.\n Bank details were changed but we got altered and was started.\n  \nShared mailbox had 13 plus people in so took me time as shared maiboxes dont have great auditing. Eventually located, blocked, changed passwords, altered MFA, coverted this mailbox to a licensed etc. The whole company is about to have all passwords changed and MFA sessions revoked.\n We already do:\n  \nYearly training std\n Atleast 2, if not 3 fake phishing tests a year that lead to extra training\n We have Avanan in place since Sept. Note, was not placed inline till after the initial breach. \n I block most countries hence how they go in via IP address in this country via a VPN\n Shed load of alerts on 365 but a a since instance, not sure any alert would have trigged unless I do alerts on any rules adding into a mailbox (we have 600+ mailboxes, rising to 2500 shortly.\n  \nAny AI solution that could help?\n Would EDR/XDR in any way?\n Move shared mailbox correspondances to helpdesk solution eg freshdesk?\n Open to comments as going to present to board what I need and why.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/slewis_1972  \n [link]   [comments]",

While these speeds may work for my use case temporarily I can't help but feel I am missing something to speed this connection up.\n Steps I have taken to attempt to speed this up:\n Set MSS clamping to 1396 after calculating my OMSS. Sniffed before and after the changes and it fixed a fragmentation issue but speeds are unchanged. Using UDP over IPv4 for tunnel.\n Ensure there was no duplex mismatch on any NIC and no traffic shaping is in place.\n CPU's are mostly idle and a combined usage of less then 15%\n Asynchronous Cryptography is on, compression is off, no rules conflict with traffic.\n Any thoughts? I am at a loss and about to attempt another VPN option in the mean time to see if I can get better speeds elsewhere.\n    submitted by    /u/boringlichlight  \n [link]   [comments]",

I didn't know anything and learned everything on the go starting with level 1 servicedesk at a ~25-man MSP. Over the past years I managed to step up and implement/solve more complex stuff. I went from rookie to network engineer configuring routers, firewalls and switches in complex setups. On the side I also was \"un-official\" teamlead of support by now. Teaching the new guys the ropes - I was the go to guy for most people to come to who were at our office. It became taxing on me: The workload was high and this made the place unsociable. The mandatory on-call shifts (one full week every 6 weeks on average) were very busy too, often clocking 4-8 additional hours outside of regular times. On top of that the pay was bad too, fairly below market average for a lot of employees on the team (people talked about it which management did not like of course, berating those who discussed it).\n Upcoming Monday I am starting a new job, I am leaving the MSP world and starting as a sysadmin at a company with about 85 employees. Working 36 hours (49) for about the same pay I got when working 40 hours (58). There is one other sysadmin who has been there for about 8 years now and the focus of the company is software development for a webservice they are hosting.\n The reason I am posting this is to gather input of other people who have made the same switch, how did life change for you? Did you run into surprises, is there any advice I should hear?\n Any input/advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot.\n    submitted by    /u/Stevanti  \n [link]   [comments]",

All “tests” passed and the Barracuda could send me test emails. I also discovered if I re-queued a message it would go back to deferred but if I skipped the scan engine and just flat out deliver it, the mail would show up… Must be something with email scanning so I reboot the appliance. That doesn’t fix it so I call Barracuda and open a case. The tech said he’s been doing it these calls all night. They pushed out a bad update and I locked up a scanning engine service. A reboot doesn’t clear it. I had to start up the troubleshooting remote connection so the tech could push out an update and restart the service. I couldn’t have done it myself as they lock that ability behind support.\n TLDR: If you’re having trouble with external emails getting stuck in the queue on your Barracuda after Wednesday night, then call support.

The guy who was doing anything with tech is my manager, the director of operations. There's a couple of people who have slapped together some scripts, and my manager's experience is somewhere around \"has built a gaming PC\". They use an MSP for managing anything that's above my manager's capacity and my job is to bring that in house.\n Honestly I'm really liking it. It's a small company of around 60 users and I've got a whole list of projects to accomplish and I've added a couple of my own ideas to the list, I think I can really tighten things up and get them running a bit more smoothly, get some disaster recovery procedures in place, etc. I'm feeling strangely confident in my ability to do what is being asked of me. That's not what I'm here for today.\n I'm only a few weeks in and this company hasn't really had an actual IT guy before, they've just had Chad the Ops Guy calling vendors. So, in order to help ease myself into a company that has a few decades of experience running but zero experience having an actual IT guy I want to do some user training of sorts. I want to do a sort of informal getting to know you and you getting to know me and what I can do with the title and theme being the title of this post.\n I have a few ideas for what sort of stuff goes in there, but I'd love to have your input. Folks who have started at small companies that haven't had IT people before them, what are the weird growing pains as companies get used to your presence? What won't the company expect about what my position brings to the table?

          "description": "Hello All,\n We're curious how other IT professionals are managing ex-employees' mailboxes when they leave the company. The organization is experiencing rapid growth and we've found our current process isn't scalable. We use Microsoft 365, but our users have the desktop applications such as Outlook through VL. Currently, when an employee leaves the company either through termination or resignation, we add ourselves to the ex-employee's 365 account and perform a manual export of their mailbox to a PST. This PST gets saved and stored on our file server forever. Seems fairly simple when it's listed like that, but it's quite a tedious process from start to finish. You need to give yourself access to that person's mailbox, let it pull in their mail on Outlook which usually takes at least an hour if not more before it becomes accessible, (and you'd be surprised at how big we let employees' mailboxes get to), and then perform the export which again, depending on the mailbox size could just freeze your Outlook up for some time. Now ironically enough we recently found that it looks like you could do all of that in the Compliance center in 365, but we still want to look at our overall process and reassess. Do we really need to keep these employees' mailboxes forever? Does 30 days suffice and then we blow it away (with exceptions of course)?

It's a domain env and we use point and print on windows 2019 server. On user's machine, In Settings > printers, when printer is installed from print server, I check printer preferences and all settings appear just like on server. But when they try to print from chrome or edge, when printing dialog pops up, I would select the printer and chose preferences, but none of the settings are there. Like stock/paper selection for example. It's like something is preventing browsers to read printer preferences. I will try again signing in as me (different domain account) and checking if issue is present but I'm pretty sure I had the user sign in on another computer and had the same issue. I will test that again. On print server though, there are no security restrictions setup.\n Any one have any idea if something in browser can affect this behavior?\n    submitted by    /u/OneOutlandishness612  \n [link]   [comments]",

I raised a Support Request with Mimecast over a week ago and have had no response at all, which is rubbish.\n So domain.com is currently in 365 TenantA with MX pointing directly to Microsoft and we will be bringing this domain into our 365 TenantB. We use Mimecast for our email security, so this domain will be added here too. My previous plan for these types of migrations has been:\n 1) Change MX of domain.com to something invalid. Emails will queue and retry at sender for an unknown period. 2) Add domain to 365 and add aliases. 3) Add domain to Mimecast and perform directory sync from 365 so Mimecast is aware of all the new aliases. 4) Change MX to Mimecast.\n This works well, with the exception of the unknown behaviour when switching to the bogus MX records.\n It got me wondering; is there a way with Mimecast that we could bring the domain in earlier, maybe even pre-migration, so that when I start the rip out of the domain from TenantA, Mimecast will queue email and then ultimately deliver when all the aliases are added to TenantB? Is that or something similar possible?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/brepmassive  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Howdy,\n I'm helping a small business who is redesigning their network from scratch. I'm looking for some recommendations on how to segment the network and also recommendations on securing the Guest network.\n We are going with Ubiquiti/Unifi equipment. When everything is all said and done we will have:\n  \nUDM/router\n POE Switch\n 4 WAPs\n 6 (or so) outside security cameras\n 1 badge reader for door access\n 1 video doorbell\n 6 smart TVs\n I think that's it but will update if I think of anything else\n  \nThe couple computers that are used only need internet access. There will not be a file server or the need to share files. All that is done through OneDrive/Teams which just needs internet.\n ​\n What recommendations would anyone have for different networks to have? I was envisioning possibly 3 networks:\n  \nMain Network\n Guest Network\n IOT Network (not sure if we need this one)\n  \nThe Main Network would be for all the stuff in the list about except the TVs.\n The Guest Network could be for the handful of computers they have. These could also go on the Main Network but I don't think there's any real need for that. Could go either way on this one. Smart devices could go here.\n The IOT Network could be for the TVs and any other \"smart\" devices that might get added down the road. Again, not sure if this is actually needed as these could just go on the Guest Network.\n ​\n The other question is, How would you recommend we secure the Guest Network?\n  \nWide Open - Company Computers would then go on the Main Network\n WPA Key - Post a key on a sign, people can connect to it just like any other network. Smart devices could go on this network\n Wide Open w/ Terms & Condition - Need to click \"I Agree\" like at a hotel - This is annoying at times and some equipment doesn't handle that sort of interface very well. Smart devices would probably need an IOT network then.\n  \n​\n Thanks for any input and ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/kelemvor33  \n [link]   [comments]",

Does the Uniflow driver connect to something in the cloud that connects to the printer?\n Going forwards it's not essential that it integrates with AD, it's a small school with 60 - 70 staff, so I could set them individually and add it to the new user process, but I curious as to peoples experiances. \n    submitted by    /u/Logical_Strain_6165  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a test, we removed the group from Full Access and half an hour later, User A couldn't see private items anymore.\n I can't find anything online (feel free to perform better Google-fu) that suggests that MS have made this change and our mailboxes were migrated to EO a few years ago and there haven't been any recent changes that we've made.

The colleague has been involved with app support for the past two years. He has made zero contributions to any scripts, processes or improvements. A few months ago I figured out he hasn't logged into the app in several months. Now that I am transitioning support to him, he only does support when specifically asked. No insightful questions, or how does XYZ work, or request for meetings to show feature ABC. I am the one who has to chase him to show him how to do things.\n During a critical issue where I was on the call with the vendor, the colleague seemed \"Away\" in Teams. I told my manager (tactfully) that I need to show my colleague how the issue was resolved, but he is away. Manager just said, \"Yes, continue to work with him and let him do the work\".\n I have a feeling this will come back to me some how.

Setting up servers, etc. I’ve always been SUPER into hardware (passion).\n But lately I’ve been setting up our new hosting servers for the company im at because they trusted me enough to move from managed hosting environment to rented servers where we manage the hosting ourselves.\n Most hosting clients are past clients where we made their sites. We host a few hundred but obviously want to increase.\n Im looking into collocation, but honestly I’m super surprised at the cost of servers. We are in South Africa so there aren’t many big DC providers. So only when we get a few servers would we look at collocation, but how “worth it” is hardware like Xeon CPU’s? I see there are now some new Intel consumer level CPUs that support ECC, and most new AMD CPUs support ECC. So for largely Wordpress and NodeJS environments is there an issue with going with AMD? Is there something I’m missing?\n Honestly I’m just not sure where to start with hardware, I’ve learnt what I can in theory, but real world reasons for certain choices, and advice is very different. \n This post was a bit of a ramble but I guess I’m just looking for any good nuggets from you pros 🙂\n    submitted by    /u/Jordz2203  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I worry its going to hit the right person where the fake document makes sense, like a plausible contract, and the user actually downloads and opens. \n Besides education is there a better way to lock this down other then blocking DocuSign and having to manually release.\n    submitted by    /u/AwayAd9297  \n [link]   [comments]",

Something I’ve been wanting to do recently is see if it might be possible to write a custom host-based IDS in Python to analyze capture files for “indicators of compromise”. I was wondering if there are any straightforward parsing methods I could apply to a capture file that might simulate an IDS but instead using Pyshark? Maybe I just need to look into Wireshark forensics and copy those techniques? I’m new to all of this so if I sound naive, it’s because I am.

Since his license is the Essentials Plus, it doesn't support Distributed Virtual Switches, only Standard Virtual Switches then I'm not able to use LACP, only static link aggregation.\n I set up the balancing mode to IP hash-based, I've defined as active the 3 uplink interfaces on the virtual switch.

Guy in remote office was moving furniture and not only found an 8 port cisco switch plugged in (not documented by people before me) but unplugged the POE on the bridge. Whatever, right?\n My entire network hiccuped for a good 5-10 seconds. HP Switches show entry of ‘Unit 1 elected as new STP root’. Ok.\n So, for the fun of it, I had the guy unplug the Ethernet on the POE, just to see what happens…and sure enough, 4-8 pings drop on my entire network. \n I would have thought nothing would have happened on my end of things (main office), but it did. I want to blame this old cisco SG250 switch, which I looked up and shows STP on out of the box. But Im not sure.\n Ive ordered up a new HP switch to replace it, and it should be here in a few days, but im just wondering what is going on and asking you guys for some insight if you have any.

          "description": "I apologize if this has been asked before, but trying to search this topic I am finding a lot of results not exactly related to my questions that have been bothering me the past few days.\n I am having a difficult time comprehending the difference between untagged and \"no-untagged\" on an HP switch. I want to be sure I am understanding what the configuration means, and I'm not just continuing to copy what I see just because it works. I do understand how vlans and tagging work for forward traffic and separate it between different subnets. Something \"tagged\" for a vlan I understand fine. But when doing a show run on an HP switch, I am seeing the labels \"no untagged\" and \"untagged\" listed, and that is throwing me off. \n When I see the words \"no untagged\" it makes me think that a port that is untagged cannot be part of this vlan (therefore only tagged ports can go here), and untagged means they are not part of that vlan. But then again, why would anyone need to specify a port is untagged? Wouldn't it be implied it is untagged on that vlan unless it is manually tagged?\n Below is an example (keep in mind, I didn't set these up):\n vlan 1\n name \"DEFAULT_VLAN\"\n no untagged 1-22,25-52\n untagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 5\n name \"MGMT\"\n tagged 23-24\n exit\n vlan 9\n name \"PC\"\n untagged 1-2,4-10,12-15,18-22,26-40\n tagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 10\n name \"DATA\"\n untagged 3,11,16-17,25,41-52\n tagged 1,23-24,28-40\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 11\n name \"VOICE\"\n tagged 1,23-24,26-40\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 12\n name \"SecWIFI\"\n tagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n vlan 13\n name \"GuestWIFI\"\n tagged 23-24\n no ip address\n exit\n    submitted by    /u/This_guy_works  \n [link]   [comments]",

So whenever I received an inbound call from anyone who wasn't on my team I could not hear voice\n When I went back home I was able to hear them when they called. With no settings changed or nothing different.\n    submitted by    /u/velociraptor90  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all,\n This VPN is insanely slow compared to connection speeds and I am having a hard time finding a reason why. Keep in mind I'm a junior sysadmin at best so I'll try to include all the needed details while keeping them sanitized. \n Quick run down: I have a ipsec site to site vpn between two networks with 1Gb duplex connections through two pfsense 7000 series firewall appliances. Connection is stable however iperf only shows a bandwidth of 68 Mbps with transfer capping out at 8.50 MBytes from two hyper-v vm on either side of the tunnel. File transfers from local to remote site are also very slow at 20Mbps. While these speeds may work for my use case temporarily I can't help but feel I am missing something to speed this connection up.\n Steps I have taken to attempt to speed this up:\n Set MSS clamping to 1396 after calculating my OMSS. Sniffed before and after the changes and it fixed a fragmentation issue but speeds are unchanged. Using UDP over IPv4 for tunnel.\n Ensure there was no duplex mismatch on any NIC and no traffic shaping is in place.\n CPU's are mostly idle and a combined usage of less then 15%\n Asynchronous Cryptography is on, compression is off, no rules conflict with traffic.\n Any thoughts? I am at a loss and about to attempt another VPN option in the mean time to see if I can get better speeds elsewhere.\n    submitted by    /u/boringlichlight  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, when put in a real-world scenario of installing a virtual machine like Kali Linux, the time to install and configure is night and day when put side by side on my main laptop.

It has to have no internet since it's using windows xp and it's an old pos system on 2 computers, and it would risk getting viruses. The other network is just the main computer that has connection to the internet and surveillance. Sometimes I would like to access the nas from the main computer to see how the backups are doing in the private network. Should I just connect another switch/hub from the main computer to the private network (old pos system)? Or do i need a specific type of router that aggregates/controls the ports that connects to the main computer then to the private network (old pos system)?\n    submitted by    /u/friendo611  \n [link]   [comments]",

But which? 192.168.0.50 or 192.168.0.150?\n I have read different recommendations so far, from definitely inside, definitely outside to never mind.\n Sometimes I stumble over devices that don't even allow a reservation outside the pool.\n That's also why I've always defined reservations within the scope and only really fixed IPs outside of it.\n On the other hand, the pfSense Docs says:\n  \nISC dhcpd only checks via ping to ensure that an IP is not actively in use when making assignments.Making a static mapping does not “reserve” that IP out of the pool.The static mapping in this case merely represents a preference for an IP and others are not prevented from taking the IP if it is not in use. \n (...) \n As such, it is best to only make assignments outside the range/pool, and the GUI enforces this practice.\n  \nSo how it the right way to do it?\n Thanks and greetings,\n Martin\n    submitted by    /u/mfessl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So we are going through a network upgrade which includes all new devices, new ISP circuit, new servers, new fiber, etc. One thing that is new and we haven't dealt with before is implementing SPLUNK. SPLUNK will be used to log everything from clients, servers, network devices, and whatever else. It is currently setup and running, but not currently collecting anything from out network devices. \n For our syslog, we currently use Solar Winds Kiwi Syslog and that collects the data from all of our devices. My understanding with SPLUNK is that we set up a forwarder and the forwarder takes all the logs the Kiwi collects and forwards them to SPLUNK.\n Our department director is tired or waiting on the contractors to figure things out, so we he wants us to start configuring SPLUNK. He stated that he thinks SPLUNK has modules or packages you can setup that are made for Cisco devices which should make it easy to setup.\n What is the best way to go about setting this up? Is using a forwarder the right way to go about doing this? And if that's the case, do I still need to setup some type of module on SPLUNK for cisco devices? Or do I just forward the logs and analyze them that way? I was told to figure out what devices I need data collected from, but we already have kiwi collecting logs from all devices, so was thinking that those logs could just be forwarded as a whole. I didn't think I would have to install modules for each device that I want to collect date from. \n I have zero experience with splunk, so just looking to get pointed in the right direction.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Nats_daddy  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have a network change/design opportunity and I am wanting to eliminate some route redistribution between OSPF and BGP. We use BGP for WAN routers to some of our sites around the state. We have remote connectivity from all around our state via our private fiber network, DMVPN tunnels (iWAN), and various peerings with Telco providers. We do this via 2 different data centers where we peer with different Telco routers via BGP, Cisco's iWAN, and our statewide aggregation routers that connect to our private fiber network across the state. The fiber network continues to grow as we lay more and more down each year. We bring those BGP routes into OSPF via route maps that have prefix lists attached to them. I wanted to go more into BGP and stop the route redistribution wherever I can. \n I am wondering if I should use BGP community values or route tags to allow our sites all around the state to determine what the best path to take would be. Basically every one of our remote locations have several methods of communication back to the data centers. I would like to make one path look better, and fail over, or be able to easily switch paths by changing a route map somewhere centrally to our data center. So if I change a value of a community string or route tag, all the sites switch paths at the same time, should I decide that needs to happen. Am I going down the right path here? Are route tags the best way to do this, or are community values the standard way to do this?\n    submitted by    /u/bardsleyb  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have watched networking educational videos, I've looked for sources, but it seems that my firewall implementation idea is somehow novel, though I am certain it is not. Or, perhaps it is such a dumb idea that it does not exist online. \n I want to segment my network. Simple enough. My idea was to use firewalls at the edge of each network segment (\"star\" topology central router leads to firewalls at each outgoing port for the various departments) for high security. \n Is this... Reasonable? I only seem to find network segmenting that simply uses switches, but with no firewall other than that which leads to the WAN or DMZ. Additionally, how would these firewalls generally be configured? I would imagine I could allow only the ports that are reasonable for that segment's network usage?\n Also, can I use application proxy gateways at the edge of network segments? Online sources imply that proxies should only be used at the outside edge of the LAN. I want one proxy for one department, but a different proxy for another. Each then accessing the central router of the star topology. \n TL;DR can firewalls be reasonably used as a security measure for multiple internal network segments?

In a blog post the creator, when talking about how croc works, explains:\n  \nThere are better ways than sequentially uploading and downloading. Instead, you can use a relay server to create a full-duplex real-time communication layer between the two computers so that “uploading” and “downloading” occur simultaneously between the two computers.\n  \nWhich in context sounds a lot like NAT hole punching. Is this just a misuse of the term stapling or is stapling something completely different / nonsense? Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Apocryphenn  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has several nics but only one active (not disabled). The server isn't set up with any virtualization. The issue is that the switch is showing 2 Mac addresses coming in on the same port that the server is attached to, arp shows another IP address , associated with a Mac address that is sequentially 1 higher (last digit) than the configured nic on the server, it also has an IP address in the same subnet as the one configured on the server so it would appear as though it would possibly be a secondary port on the nic. The server responds to pings on this secondary IP, nmap scans show only udp 68 being open on this IP. Here is the weird part, the machine doesn't show the IP being configured anywhere, ipconfig doesn't even list the Mac nor the IP of this secondary IP. Running Wireshark while pinging the secondary IP shows what you would expect from a configured nic, except it isn't configured anywhere that I can find...any suggestions on locating where this is coming from would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/judgethisyounutball  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thanks for the info. \n Are there switches on the market that support RSTP with multiple rings in a switch. I am a design engineer for a BAS manufacturer and the industry is migrating out of rs485 twisted pair to using RSTP compatible switches with a Ring topology to keep costs low on the networking side. For example do switches allow you to set a root and backup port for multiple rings or are you limited to one failover port per switch. I imagine there are a wide range of options based on cost but this would be in the area of 3-5 rings per switch at most for very large networks. \n To clarify the end goal is to move into An IP friendly physical layer that maintains the cost effectiveness of daisy chains while using ring topology to give a fail over route if the cable is ever damaged/or enough nodes fail we exceed 100m between devices that are online. \n The current direction looks like a small 8 port industrial switch per network but I grow curious if there could be cost benefit to a single switch 18/24/48 port that could have multiple networks on 1.\n    submitted by    /u/Knoon1148  \n [link]   [comments]",
