          "description": "SUMMARY\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory to warn network defenders about exploitation of CVE-2023-3519, an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting NetScaler (formerly Citrix) Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway. In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a webshell on a critical infrastructure organization’s non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance. The webshell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim’s active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network-segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement.\nThe victim organization…",

However, we don't patch the Linux/AIX machines at all. I'm not a strong Linux person but I'm looking for information on how people manage the non-Windows based computers.\n Are there programs that can inventory and automate the process by sending patches to the machines that need them? Can I just send a command to every machine and they will install what they need? Can I specify only Security patches vs all patches? What options are there that I should look into?\n I'd prefer free tools but would consider paid ones if they are worth the cost. Our company is currently looking at BigFix because it can apparently patch every OS out there, but I've read a lot of things about how crazy expensive and complicated it is so if there's a better way to go, let me know.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/kelemvor33  \n [link]   [comments]",

No reason, just failed to uninstall.\n Done the same with the actual remover tool from them as well, which prompted for the tamper protect pass, entered that , then failed to uninstall. Cool so i drag and drop it to the recycle bin, empty it and reboot. Cool looks gone\n Attempt to reinstall, installer and it states that installation failed, as \"your system has the sophos endpoint product installed\"\n So i cant uninstall, i cant reinstall.

We use windows configuration designer to provision a kiosk package for all versions of windows. \n ​\n My colleague and I are running into an issue where when we run the kiosk package on the thin client and log into the account declared in the xml file (.\\user), we can't log in.

Those massive mainframes occupied entire rooms, leaving little space for anything else. Can you imagine that? As the need for better organization and efficient data management arose, the ingenious concept of server racks was born in the 1970s. But wait, there's more!

Best practice. Learning about containerization is one thing, but getting familiar with setting up an entire infrastructure dedicated to containerization is what I'm aiming towards.

So of course we've already terminated the user and they're no longer in AD. If I try to create a new user with the same username of course the SID doesn't match so it can't authenticate to the database to do any owner operations or assign a new db_owner. Of course because we let the vendor manage their stuff in our network they didn't add my team as db_owner I can't do anything in the DB and they've lost the default DB creds which they never provided to us in the first place.\n If anybody has any ideas how I can get past this problem without having to rebuild the database for an existing production solution I would be eternally grateful.\n And if you work for a vendor: I'm not mad at you but push back against crap practices like this. If you manage a solution for your clients, in their network or yours, it's your responsibility to maintain appropriate access to data and resources.

I've been researching two main overlays for this task - Netmaker and Tailscale - but I'm having difficulty deciding between them.\n Our setup involves hosting some products in GCP and running internal services on Dell servers. We have a mix of workstations with different operating systems, and our network is segregated into VLANs.\n Both Netmaker and Tailscale offer different advantages and disadvantages. Tailscale, being a userspace WireGuard, might have slower speeds, while Netmaker could require more deployment and maintenance effort. However, the choice between the two may also depend a bit on how far we want to take the zero trust approach. For instance, should communication between two servers internally go through this solution? Is having to manage the ACL settings in a JSON file a good or bad thing (infra as code)? \n If any of you have encountered a similar dilemma or have experience with either Netmaker or Tailscale, I'd greatly appreciate your insights.

I'm trying to avoid buying products from SolarWinds and similar vendors.\n For my purposes, getting a list of web domains accessed is good enough. These users don't have access to change their DNS server settings, and if they can figure out how to bypass DNS filtering by going to a numerical IP I'd die from shock.\n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/plebbitier  \n [link]   [comments]",

In my case I am getting an influx of calls to report systems running very slowly, symptoms include taking 5 mins from clicking to doing anything, Microsoft Office/Outlook constantly crashing.\n I connected to some of the affected systems and in task manager the resources are ok, plenty of CPU/Memory available and, oddly, SSD running at 0-10%. I was able to reproduce the issue, composing a new email in Outlook and sending or closing that window caused an app crash, task manager crashed when I tried to close it.\n In every case, KB5028166 was installing. On some systems this update would get stuck at 73%, 74% or 90%. When rebooting, the system would hang on the blue backgound rebooting message but the circle of dots that usually appears above it was missing. It would sit here for 40+ minutes after which I had to force a reboot.\n Eventually, after several of these reboots, it seems to finally complete after which system responsiveness goes back to normal.\n I thought I would post about it to see how widespread the issue was and if anyone had found a better way to install the update. I have seen it affecting Lenovo Thinkpads and Dell Optiplex PCs, Windows 10 Pro 22H2.\n    submitted by    /u/ak47uk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone. \n I'm working for a small company with nine employees, which doesn't have that many requirements concerning hosting - a super-plain, no-frills, static site with medium traffic. For some reason, the hosting provider (a small local company) we've been using so far sent a notification that they're raising the price starting next month without any rational explanation. \n My employer isn't happy about that and asked me to look into another hosting service. He's one kind of miser that would rather hang himself than pay an extra $40 a month without a reasonable justification (I get panic attacks when I remember the circles of hell I went through to get a raise a few months back).\n For the last few days, I've been looking into all these Hosting Services Compared, trying to find something that would suit my boss's financial requirements and, at the same time, would provide quality service. While researching, it hit me that I could open my own company and make some extra cash each month. \n I know a couple of similar companies (with some I worked in the past) that work with the same hosting, and I imagine they also aren't happy with the price increase. I don't think that it would be hard convincing them to switch to my service. \n I talked with a fellow friend who works in a hosting company today. But instead of sharing any advice, he tried talking me out of this, saying that it'll be a pain in the ass and not worth even trying because it'll be hard to compete with the giants that have a ton of employees.\n I'd really appreciate it if someone here who runs or has owned a small hosting business could share their experience. I'm particularly interested in the potential income, pitfalls, and problems that may await me if I decide to go on with the idea. \n Thanks in advance for your help. \n    submitted by    /u/acutelycrab27  \n [link]   [comments]",

My company is currently using Google Workspace as our main identity provider however we also have M365 accounts. We are also using AzureAD for our laptop sign as well as Intune. My IT manager has tasked me with federating our M365 with our Google Workspace accounts which is all fine and well. We have tested this functionality and our staff are succesfully signing into their M365 accounts with Google. However as a result of changing our auth to federation, our test staff are unable to sign into their laptops anymore. \n I have looked online and have not found any concrete evidence on if it is possible for staff to sign into their laptops (that are bound to Intune) with their Google accounts. Does anyone have expierence with this and know if it is possible or not? If it is, please could you share any resources you have on this. I did discover the Google Credential Provider for Windows (GCPW) during my investigation but have so far have had some strange inconsistencies with it where some of our tests users are able to use it and seeminly log into the enviroment but Intune has not behaved or they haven't been able to login at all. \n We may fully migrate our identity provider to AzureAD in the future however at this point in time, our small team of 3 people doesn't have capacity for this. We're a fully remote company so we want to make the process to signing into company machines as smooth as possible whilst also reducing security issues (2FA is mandated for our Google Accounts) by reducing the use of passwords as much as possible. \n Thank you all for your time!

But I have this one problem.\n From every computer I have tested, the first connection works within seconds, but if you disconnect and reconnect, I get an \"error, try again\" on my TV. I don't have to do anything, W10 keeps trying to connect and on its second attempt it works (ca. 15s of waiting). If I cancel when I get the error, and reconnect manually, I get the error again. It only works if i let the laptop reconnect by itself.\n As I said, this only happens if the laptop was already connected once. If I restart the laptop I can repeat the whole thing, susccessful on the first try, error on the second.\n Huh?\n Has anybody experienced this?\n PS: I don't have the adapter on my inhouse wi-fi, it's a direct connection.\n    submitted by    /u/PreciousP90  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve been there many years and was the sole IT person for about 100 people. \n We hired the only person who applied and he seemed underqualified but it could work. I planned my exit to work with him for a couple weeks and bring him up to speed. Something seemed off with him and I just realized today that it seems like he’s just going to use this gig to pad his resume. By itself wouldn’t be a huge concern but he’s planning some massive projects that will cost thousands of dollars that could otherwise be spent on the actual purpose of the org. Meanwhile he’s not considering some specific projects I’ve suggested that had been pushed back due to Covid and other restraints but certain outdated equipment is becoming a liability… just not a sexy project. \n One project is upgrading the network to 10g when we barely make a dent in our 200mbps internet bandwidth. He’s done no research with staff or historical network usage to justify any of these projects. Unfortunately, no one else in the org understands IT and I’m not sure anyone will question these frivolous upgrades. \n I’m debating whether or not I should bring this up with my former boss but I don’t want to get into a pissing match. I truly value the organization and the people there and it’s frustrating to see things going this route. \n My thought would be to bring up my concerns and coach on what questions to ask.

          "description": "Hello! Long story short, the place i work for needs me to install a program called VeriAdmin from a company called bioscrypt, that manages fingerprints stores in a fingerprint scanner from the same comapny. The only issue is that Bioscrypt doesnt exist anymore, and after calling the company that absorbed them, i was told that they dont have that software anymore. Checking online, and there are no downloads of this software either (i did find one called secureadmin by the same company but its not the same software sadly)\n Anyways, we have one windows 10 computer where that software is installed and works on, but its due to be retired next week. i've tried to transfer over all the files, including the .dll's and the registry keys from the working computer to a new one, but in the process of being transferred over to a flash drive, it immediatly loses some data, since the exe loses its icon and any information about it in properties. Despite this i try to run it on the new computer and it simply wont run either in compat mode, as administrator etc. \n I ran procmonitor on the computer where it works and on the newer one to see what could be missing, and apparently, right after trying to QueryNameInfo a DLL thats stored in system32, it fails on the new computer, because on the new computer right after it starts a registry key named \"windows error reporting\", while on the old one it just continues with opening the HKCU registry key. \n I checked the DLL and theyre the exact same, with the same permissions, and everything else the same. Im not sure that this is the exact issue with the software, maybe something happens after it runs that DLL that doesnt show up on procmonitor, but if anyone could help me figure this out i would be very grateful. here is a screenshot of the procmonitor logs and i show where it fails (the new pc is on the left, the old one on the right): https://imgur.com/a/pVhHaQC\n again if anyone can help i would greatly appreciate it! thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/SamPlantFan  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently, we use our own servers for email, but we would like to transfer the domain to Microsoft. Additionally, for certain users, we are purchasing Microsoft 365 Apps for Business licenses, including Office apps, etc. We currently have 35 such users, but during the migration, we will need around 50 users immediately, and within a year, the number may exceed 100 as we expand into international markets (we already have open companies in Spain, Portugal, Austria, Poland, etc.).\n As the company is present in multiple markets, the plan is to have all admin.microsoft processes executed in the main company, while in foreign countries, there will be the option to only add/remove users with licenses.\n For optimal operation, we would require a plan similar to what Microsoft 365 Business Standard offers at €11.70 per license/month. I'm wondering if you have any other suggestions for optimizing the company's operations with this number of users?\n Additional questions:\n What is the management principle for \"aliases\" on Microsoft servers?

They are a design firm with 12 employees with ~1.3tb of used storage. This would be my first server replacement and would appreciate some feedback. The existing servers were installed by their previous IT vendor and i'm looking for some recommendations on how to go about this upgrade.\n Their current setup:\n  \nDomain Controller - Windows Server 2016 (planning to replace after the file server)\n Used for very basic AD functions and DNS. Pretty much just used for creating users and authenticating them to the domain, no complex policies or in depth configurations.\n File Server - Dell Optiplex, Windows 10, 8gb ram, single 4tb hard drive (NO raid /facepalm)\n  \nI am looking to replace both machines, starting with the file server. The budget is about $3,000 for each machine. Their are a design firm and use Revvit / Autocad, thus cloud solutions are not viable, they store the projects on the file server and access them in office, beyond that its a very simple setup.\n This is what i'm looking at for the file server:\n Dell PowerEdge R250 / T150 Tower\n  \nWindows Server Essential 2022\n Intel Xeon E-2334\n 16GB / 32GB RAM\n 2x 4TB enterprise SSD - Raid 1 for data\n 512GB SSD for OS\n 10GB network card\n  \nDoes this look ok? Are SSDs overkill for this? I'm thinking of purchasing the basic ram/HD options from Dell and purchasing upgraded ram & hard drives for the items listed above since Dells upgrade prices are pretty significant. I want to set them up for success and considering they are using a consumer Dell PC with Windows 10 for their file server, anything would be an upgrade to their current setup.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/----Questions----  \n [link]   [comments]",

We current have multiple DFS servers in different geographical offices that replicate using DFS-R and then we use a software called PeerLock to handle file locking within the replication groups. This has been pretty solid but our initiatives are to move to cloud-based services. Whether it's SharePoint, Azure File Services, Egnyte or something else, that's yet to be determined.\n Some other info - 100% Windows clients, having mobile app access would be a plus, but not a requirement. Whether mapped drive or sync client is fine, we will need our users to rework files since we have an Excel linking problem, sheets linking to sheets, to sheets, to sheets, back to original sheet, and more sheets. Total storage need would be 15 TB initially. We also have folder overrun so we would definitely run into length issues in a SharePoint.\n I'm wondering what folks have turned to as their next version of file services in distributed offices that is as cloud-first as possible and what issues, caveats, or reviews you have.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/koecerion  \n [link]   [comments]",

All the Microsoft threads regarding Teams Calendar troubleshooting. The connection test from Microsoft. Its telling me it cant reach the mailbox.

Everything else works perfectly fine. My current thinking: We dont synchronise the Mailbox GUID through Azure AD Connect so Teams thinks the user does not have a mailbox and stops looking.

However, I CAN log into my work's system and Hulu when using my Mobile Hotspot. I had zero issues on Friday, no hiccups. When I went to try both sites yesterday, neither worked. I should (hopefully) be fine using my Hotspot for the day, but obviously I can't/don't want to be using my Hotspot indefinitely.

I doubt that had anything to do with it, but IDK. \n Thoughts? Ideas? Recommendations? Any DIY troubleshooting I can try?

But what is the best option? We are used to having network drives pinned, and I have no experience with Sharepoint.

I work at an msp and I worry our only really intelligent engineer/sysadmin may be leaving within a year, as I'm noticing a change in attitude and he really doesn't even need the job.\n The problem is we won't really have someone to take over that position and my company won't likely hire someone with the same experience due to cost.. \n I love to learn but getting certs is not really applicable for me as I can't really retain knowledge without LOTS of practice,BUT studying them still helps.\n My company treats us VERY well and I want to be able to help if this happends. \n When anything really serious goes down (clients drive gets deleted by an idiot(me and another tech when I was new 2 years ago) tech he worked all weekend to restore the whole server (veeam). Things like that we don't really have a good replacement for tech wise. \n Where would be a good place to start, to start learning things like this so I could at least be able to help troubleshoot ideas to fix possible large issues? As long as I have basic understanding I can google and get it figured out, but as it stands I don't even have that. \n Unfortunately this person beyond doesn't have time to train anyone and doesn't do well with dealing with less knowledgeable people as they don't have the nessisary social skills/patients for that, so asking them isn't really an option. \n Any help will be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Mr_Cowley  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the past I have repackaged some software using the WixToolset.\n A couple of months ago, the maker of ghostscript decided to remove their silent install switch which fucked up our SCCM packages. We can't get rid of ghostscript as it is integrated in a lot of our homemade software and management don't wanna pay for a corporate license.\n From what I can see, ghostscript is just a drop of files. It works flawlessly just compiling the source code and launching it from any location as long as the files and in the good directory.\n So I figured I could use the Wix Toolset to do just that but when I use the heat component which register my components together it just run for days without completing. \n I am lost. I am NOT a programmer and programming is not my strenght...at all. I can script but thats it. Main sysadmin is pretty desperate to ask me and I might need some help. My approach is probably wrong. I tried but uncompress files (opening the exe with 7zip) and the binaries created from the source code but both do the same thing.\n There is about 600 files and directory combined for Wix to process. It's way more than what I am used to. Maybe thats the problem?\n For now, I used a repackager like Emco and it...kinda works but it's clunky and I don't trust it at all. I had a lot of issues in the past with it but when it works, it works. \n I borrowed a licence from an a friend but its a one time deal.\n Anyone have an idea how to do this cleanly?\n    submitted by    /u/init32  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our outage windows are late at night so even paying a consultant is 3 to 4 times the amount it costs to pay a full time employee. Often times you have to hand hold the vendor and teach them the environment. Half the time you end up doing a majority of the work or stranded in meetings with these people sucking up hours.

I can appreciate how end users or even technicians without a good bit of knowledge in this area might reach that conclusion, but what baffles me is when knowledgable IT people come to this conclusion with absolutely no evidence or reason.\n A case in point would be a vendor I recently dealt with, they're very knowledgable in their area and probably have more years IT experience than I've been alive, but then it pivoted to that dreaded phrase. Through the course of troubleshooting, it became clear they had no idea how DHCP worked. Again, I understand how people can have specialized areas of knowledge, but how the fuck can you spend 3 decades supporting networked devices and have no idea how they receive IP addresses!?\n Even beyond that, so many trash apps immediately throw errors like \"There's a problem with your Wi-Fi\" when in reality, they are experiencing an outage. Sure, that might sound better to the end user, but it's completely wrong and sending them in the direction of troubleshooting something that's working perfectly fine. Are the devs really that lazy and incompetent that they can't try to ping some common external resources to determine that the network is functional? Or shit, at the very least add the word \"might\" in front of that rather than convey with absolute certainty that your shit app expertly diagnosed that your Wi-Fi is indeed broken.\n    submitted by    /u/vtvincent  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm doing what I consider traditional IT stuff for them. Business wide systems. Laptops, servers, 365 and similar cloud services, basic support, etc. and I find myself saying this a lot...

They are usually bureaucratic behemoths that everyone hates to deal with, but to each their own. And I've worked at places that decentralize this more. The communications department might handle websites, the analytics staff would handle data work, app development department builds apps, and an internal IT department does what I basically do.\n Curious how ya'll personally think about this and what your experience at different jobs has been.

He needs full access to his main pc without anyone else's help.\n I also considered just literally downloading his entire harddrive onto a portable drive, and plugging into his laptop so he has all his files, but I'm not sure how big it is, or if this is even the best solution, so I come here asking you all. \n Please lmk if you have any more questions and any recommendations as to what we should do.

They carry the iPads with them at all times because they are traveling between patients. \n I have an issue of people forgetting the passcode of the iPad or locking themselves out, even they are the ones who set it up initially. \n Very often MDM can’t clear the passcode because the iPad requires Internet connection and they can’t connect to the internet because it’s locked which leads me to have iPad replaced. \n I tried to configure the iPad as “Shared”, but it doesn’t work for us since Apple requires a shared iPad passcode after authentication via Azure AD lol. \n The only solution I’m thinking of right now is to set up a passcode for the iPad which is the last 4 or 6 digits for the SN.

(There are too much of them to lose overview).\n The one we choose mustn't break the bank to much, but other than that we are allowed to suggest any ticketing system we feel would suit our needs. However, from what I can tell, most of them offer the same services with the same quality and for comparable prices. So my question to you all is: Which ticketing system do you use and why should or shouldn't we go for that one? One requirement though, it must use/support AzureAD SSO.\n I'd love to go for a big one like Service-Now or Jira, but I think those options will be shot down due to pricing.

I'm trying to sync a perforce project with a team in NZ and I'm based in the UK and no matter what connection I try I'm getting a hard sync limit of 2mbps up and down. I've tried two different PC's and two completely seperate internet connections with different providers.\n The port 1666 is forwarded. All firewall rules are set to allow P4V to access. I'm not recieving any network or connection errors, it's just insanely slow. Our sys admin gave me an IP for the US server and this has the same issue, hard limit of 2mbps. I've tried VPNs.\n My p4 info readout is instantaneous implying theres no issue with connecting to the server. Someone has tried using my account in NZ and it was fine so not an account issue.\n Unfortunately Perforce support still haven't replied after a week and our network admin based in NZ isn't too familiar with it but can't see what the issue could be on his side of things. So reaching out to alternative means. Will happily ping someone a tip if they help me fix this as it's really pushing my progress back on the project.\n Cheers!\n Edit: Running Windows 11. Workplace Ethernet connection and two different mobile hotspots have been tried. All yeild a hard sync cap of 2mbps. Zero issues with pulling file lists or connecting to the project in perforce.

Seems to make total sense, and we don't have complex management requirements, and we're already licensed for it.\n Our current environment is pretty simple and 'traditional' - machines joined to a domain, a couple simple GPOs, and some third party patching and inventory apps. All Win10, but looking to move to Win11 later this year and next:\n I have a bunch of questions that I'm having a bit of a hard time nailing down and getting conflicting answers:\n  \nIf we enroll a PC, it looks like it still stays on the domain... At that point I guess we just... disable GPOs (and move them into InTune)? I presume InTune should become the single source of truth for management/policies? \n User Profiles - If we enroll a device and they're still joined to the domain - I presume they keep the existing user profile?\n A user gets a new PC (Win10 or 11) - Should it even be joined to the domain at that point? Is there any value add anymore?\n Virtually all of our apps are web apps - except for a traditional file share (Z: drive) - I know a non-domain machine can still connect to a file share (they would need to manually put in their creds)... Anything to be aware of here? (We want to get rid of this file share, most of our stuff is in sharepoint, but we still have a legacy LOB app requiring it for now - looking to get away from that next year).\n Servers - Can stay on the domain (and probably need to), but what are you all doing for management of servers (eg. patching)? I know Azure has autopatch and a few things, but that seems very... limited in behavior.\n  \nAnything else we should be aware of? Seems simple from a certain standpoint, but also completely different than what we've been used to doing for 25 years.\n    submitted by    /u/sysadmin99  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have servers that can get out, and the hope is that we can deploy a remote access solution that we would be able to access the machines across the network jumping through the server. Essentially we'd use a solution like TeamViewer to instigate a session to the server, and would want to jump to the deployed machines from there. \n We have been using Windows remote desktop connection in the interim, however, this isn't a good solution for this use case as the machine gets logged out when disconnecting from the session, making things more difficult on the user. \n Anyone have any experience in deploying a remote access solution that works just across the LAN?

Recently they have been experiencing really poor performance on the software and we've been trying to get to the bottom of it. \n The software is file storage / BLOB vault with clients connecting to it via a IIS web application layer. The customer has about 3 users on the system so it's not a huge deployment and the vault database is about 150gb (140gb of BLOB and 10gb of database spread across ~ 15 MDF) \n  \nThe instance is idling most of the time on CPU ( <10% usage)\n It's using less than 40% available memory. I've checked SQL server and it's using about 1/4 of the available 1.4gb shared memory pool\n Network speed tests are very good (as you would expect from AWS)\n Disk activity doesn't appear very high but...\n  \nHaving checked everything with the developers, the problems seemed to be stemming from the database. We've upgraded the storage from \"gp2\" tier to gp3 and doubled the IOPS and throughput from 900 IOPS / ~250MB/s to 5000 IOPS / 500MB/s.\n Having done all this its running a bit better but not dramatically better. It's not clear though if it is the storage which is the bottleneck or if something else is going on.\n The server currently runs MS SQL Express 2019 but we're nowhere near hitting the memory pool limit and it doesn't appear like its getting thrashed. I just wondered though if there are any other limits/issues which could be causing this version of SQL Server to be causing problems? \n Does anyone know if upgrading to MS SQL Server Standard 2019 offers any performance benefits over Express for general SQL work loads?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Soup_Roll  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The release of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK V2 by Microsoft has introduced a new challenge for Microsoft 365 admins - the need to migrate existing scripts once again. Unlike before, the familiar \"select-MgProfile\" option for switching to the beta profile is no longer available with SDK V2. Instead, admins must install the beta module separately. Furthermore, the v1.0 and beta modules differ in their cmdlet prefixes.\n One reason administrators have heavily relied on the beta profile is its ability to retrieve all the necessary properties, unlike v1.0 which only retrieves limited properties when executing cmdlets. Consequently, previously migrated scripts from Azure AD now require yet another migration effort. The cycle seems never-ending as we navigate these continuous updates and adapt their scripts accordingly.\n Have you encountered the script migration challenge?

But it's a kludge, you need a linux VM to start with and then for every VLAN you need an interface inside that VM...\n But Cisco routers & switches can do this on their own, here's a simple configuration with 3 VLANs:\n ! service-list mdns-sd PERMIT-ALL permit 10 match message-type any ! service-routing mdns-sd ! interface Vlan3 ip address 10.1.3.1 255.255.255…",

That was a shock\n So I’m wondering if the domain situation is the issue and the backup server should be joined domain to get full speed?\n I want it off domain in case of ransomware or any virus attack?

So kind of a moot question but maybe I'm missing something.\n Second is WSL2 permissions,\n As far I know WSL VM inherits windows permissions and user, with enhanced container isolation we fix our other issues.

After selecting 1 for changing the cert the setup asks you to put into your pw for \"administrator@vsphere.local\" and yea we lost that somehow.\n Okay next step trying to reset the \"administrator@vsphere.local\" user acc.

Call me lazy, but I am not a very deep sysadmin. I use linux on my main, but sometimes find myself having to do things like setting up a node stack on an AWS EC2 instance, with a specific flavor of linux. I love command line, but I've always dreamed of not having to spend half my time looking up the commands to run for the same thing on different systems.\n This brings me to my script. I have already found a ton of use cases and usefulness out of it and it has only been an evening! I am sharing here the github as I have made it open source, and a friend of mine has also made a windows port of the script called wombat.\n Please let me know what you guys think as sysadmins. I know that using AI is basically cheating, but for someone who's not really so much sysadmin it is good. I also made it so that it saves the generated scripts in the scripts folder so it is easy to use as a reference/cheat sheet for commands in any OS/shell.\n    submitted by    /u/enspiralart  \n [link]   [comments]",

How do you handle that?\n (On the maintainer side, all of them have the same answer - they don’t understand why TeamViewer is not used like everywhere else, but my security colleagues think it is not a good idea at all to allow that on mission critical hardware, and I tend to agree)\n    submitted by    /u/FederalPralineLover  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We have recently deployed a U6 Pro AP within our infrastructure, which is the sole Unifi device in operation within the organisation.\n One of our main goals with this is to enable the support of a Guest Wi-Fi SSID which supports client isolation to ensure that guests have restricted access on the network.\n I have enabled the hotspot portal to achieve this and configured the settings as needed in the portal.\n Within the Pre-Authorisation Allowances, I have added the IP addresses of the internal DNS servers, the default gateways, along with 8.8.8. However, when clients are connected, they are unable to resolve any hostnames. They can ping via IP.\n Our anti-virus does put its own DNS into the IP configuration of clients. I added this IP as a pre-auth, but I had no luck. \n As a test, I had amended the AV policy on my laptop to use the static DNS servers within the organisation (also added as allowed pre-auth IPs) and flushed the DNS cache.\n However, I am still unable resolve hostnames across devices.\n Due to the above, the captive portal never displays on the devices connected to the Guest network.\n I can't get access into Unifi support to be able to query this. Just cannot get DNS working for the life of me. I can see DNS queries going back and forth between my laptop and the DNS server via Wireshark.\n    submitted by    /u/KickAssAdmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

Really, it looks like Ubuntu doesn't give a single F about Snaps, allowing them to rot and become unusable.\n Two quick examples, that are ESSENTIAL in app development:\n  \nDocker - published by Canonical, latest version in snaps is 20.10.24, released April 4th, in Docker APT repo we have 24.0 already, two versions ahead\n Jenkins - published by Snapcrafters (star developer, responsible for example for Gimp, Discord, Android Studio, Sublime), in Snaps latest stable version is 2.290, released IN APRIL OF 2021!\n  \nWeren't Snaps supposed to be a way for developers to publish official packages, up to date and self-contained? A way to install latest version of software even on older distro release? \n In my humble opinion, it's just harmful. If Canonical is going to push Snaps down our throats, delete APT versions in favour of Snaps, shouldn't they make absolutely sure, we are getting up-to-date and supported versions of software?

I'm wondering if any other admins have an alternative service to recommend that is either the same price or cheaper and offers some benefit compared to Mosyle.\n There's a fair amount of threads on here about MDM in general but it would need to be one that supports education specifically - so that the Education-specific profiles for Classroom and Shared iPad continue to work.\n    submitted by    /u/TTxJJ  \n [link]   [comments]",

Revoking access in this scenario is almost impossible.\n When I talk to IT teams, they're like, \"Oh, we need some pricey 'zero trust' solution to fix this. And guess what, it's not in the budget.\" But when I tell them there's a free open-source way to do it, they look at me like I've grown a second head.\n So, to prove them wrong, I wrote this nifty script. It uses PAM, SSSD, and the Google Authenticator PAM module. What it does is, it lets your Linux machines authenticate with Google Workspace, AD, or other IdPs. And the cherry on top? It can even set up 2FA for you.\n Here's the link to my script: https://github.com/smulikHakipod/idm-ssh-configurator\n I'm hoping some of you find this useful. Or at least, I hope it gets you thinking that maybe managing SSH keys doesn't need to be such a mess.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/smulikHakipod  \n [link]   [comments]",

On some resets this is fixed.\n This issue happens on all domain join after reset. after awhile the whole desktop freezes up, like not being able to click on the taskbar or desktop icons, but if I press the win key it fixes this desktop and task bar. But issue appears again.\n Our usual laptop enrollment goes like: * reset * change name, restart * create admin account * run a basic Ps script that disables few functions) * enroll to domain using user account * switch user \n Keep resetting it because I can't seem to leave the domain either. When I try to leave and provide the password it says its incorrect.\n The laptops work fine before domain join. I tried enrolling another old lenovo laptop, it's able to join, leave and reset with no issues whatsoever.\n On Monday I'm gonna try an older iso like 20h2 and update it to the latest version instead.\n Any thoughts will be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/RadiantSkiesJoy  \n [link]   [comments]",

My CS colleague and I were arguing about when to do it. I would much better prefer to wait until all our 10 used add-on are tested then updated (that may or may not take a while) while he would test and get rid of the un-updated add-on or if not possible use another soft which have the feature we need without needing to use third party add-on which are prone to not get updated as often. We are pretty early in our deployment so it still make more or less sense to change software. \n I get his point which is that it's absolutely terrible not to correct a known cybersecurity risk for some feature but these feature are all needed for our use case and I know that updating when using multiples add-on can get messy quickly. We didn't setup a test environment yet, we plan to set it up as fast as possible to see if these feature do break. What seems clear to me is that the same issue will arise for each of our app later down the road. \n How do you guys tackle updating software in your company especially when certains third party features might break, do you simply get rid of it ? Do you develop yourself these features so that maintaining it is less an issue ? Would you use a software that would support theses features natively (if it exist) ?\n    submitted by    /u/Asgeir_From_France  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use Cisco Small business switches because I'm not paying more than $700 for an access layer switch. I had to fight to get us moved over to M365, instead of just letting everyone use their personal Gmail address for company email. Every laptop across the whole company is refurbished.\n I'm my own boss. The only person I report to is the CEO, and he lets me run things. I feel great about what I do. My SMB makes things that people need, and I help make that possible. I am well respected by everyone I work with. I'm paid enough to live comfortably, and I get to go to all my kid's school events. My work-related-stress is easily manageable. I have very little interest in working for a large entity, though admittedly I don't know what it's like to be part of a large enterprise team. I suspect that in some ways it's different and some ways the same. There are probably great enterprises to work for just like there are great SMBs, and terrible ones. I think my setup is preferable, but I can understand why someone would want a more sophisticated environment.\n I'm really tired of seeing derision and disrespect lobbed from one side of this divide towards the other here on /r/sysadmin.

I've heard of a company's entire Azure tenant getting corrupted, or somehow becoming inaccessible for a long time. We've got a hybrid AD, in an Azure VM-Windows Server. We keep files in a server share, as well as in like 50 different Teams/SP libraries. \n I back up our server shares externally to an AWS bucket, in addition to Azure's built-in backup. I run test file restores once a month. We use Afi to backup mailboxes, Onedrives and Teams/Libraries. But the only backups of our AD are stored in Azure's backup; I've never tried to restore it. \n Should we consider what happens if our whole Azure/MS365 tenant goes sour? Do companies keep an alternate domain? Testing the viability of restoring AD and Teams to it? Should we have a plan in case Microsoft goes south altogether? \n Also, we're supposed to do vulnerability scans and network penetration testing, for our insurance policy.

I'm currently using Sectigo.com but each employee is having to create their own account to order it & we're having to put the company credit card on each employees account. There doesn't seem to be a way to centrally manage it. Is there a better service where we can order certificates for employees while being able to centrally manage them, see expiration dates, etc? \n Muchas Gracias\n    submitted by    /u/CelticDubstep  \n [link]   [comments]",

Allowing staff to switch to remote if they leaving for meetings during the day. currently the line of thinking is a simple power app that will produce a 30 day log. \n ​\n Note; we are not looking to track employee productivity, soley if they are in the physical building or not. \n    submitted by    /u/MrMickRi  \n [link]   [comments]",

After deploying a couple of VMs, I noticed that on all pre-existing servers the Windows Firewall is disabled, while I leave it enabled and only open the minimum required ports/protocols. When I asked about the reasoning behind this I got an answer which basically comes down to:\n - It can easily be bypassed by hackers so it's not that useful\n - In a full Windows environment you need so many ports open that you might as well disable it\n - We have a good datacenter firewall (servers are segregated and firewalled in different vlans: mgmt, web, SAP, etc)\n - We don't have the time/staff to figure out the required ports for all servers, and even for new servers it needs to be configured, documented, etc. \n It felt a bit awkward to react to because I don't want to come across as an asshole-know-it-all right from the start, but I tried to explain my opinion that I don't see it as a magic solution for everything but just an additional layer in the entire security picture. In the end the conclusion was that we keep it disabled to keep it consistent with all the existing servers. Which is fine I guess, it's not what I would do, but it's not my call. To me it just seems weird and contradictory for a security engineer to have this kind of opinion, but at the same time the guy does have a lot of experience, so... Am I crazy?

Just wondering what everyone recommends for SQL server best practice with performance as a primary consideration?\n We have an application that uses SQL server as the backend database, and performance has been pretty crummy since implementation. \n We're replatforming the environment and I want to take best practices into consideration during the environment refresh. From what I've gathered here are some of the changes we'll be making:\n  \nSeparate application server and SQL server to be two separate VMs so SQL server is not fighting the application services for resources\n Create seperate virtual disks for C drive, DB drive, and logs drive (currently everything is just installed under C drive)\n Configure memory allocation settings to equal or greater value of the sum of all of your DB files if possible (it is doable in our env) -- From my understanding with manipulates the SQL server to favor logical reads vs. physical reads?\n  \nAny other recommendations? Any that I've listed above that are unnecessary/outdated? When setting memory do you set a minimum memory value or leave it at default? Right now our SQL instance max memory is set to 2147483647, should I leave that or set it explicitly to >= to the sum of DB files or does it not matter? When considering storage, we have an all flash Nimble SAN, should I be specifying any settings on the LUN for optimal performance or are those recommendations obsolete with the use of NVMe flash?

I'm not even sure what I hope to achieve by posting this, but sometimes you just need to vent.\n I pride myself on being a self-motivated individual who actively seeks out opportunities to learn new things. I even go the extra mile by taking classes outside of work hours. When it comes to PowerShell, I'm absolutely passionate about it. Most of my projects revolve around automation, utilizing PowerShell, APIs, and Power Automate.\n But here's where things take a frustrating turn. Our company got acquired by another company last year, and unfortunately, they don't have many people with skills like mine. So, naturally, they're quite pleased with my abilities, and I've been automating a significant portion of their processes.\n However, recently, something has been happening that I'm not comfortable with at all. Every time I update my manager on my progress, she insists on having two other individuals join the meeting. It's as if she wants me to showcase everything I do to them. It feels like I can't even perform a simple right-click on my computer without those two people hovering over me.\n Now, don't get me wrong—I'm all for knowledge sharing. But here's the issue: the focus should be on \"sharing.\" These individuals have their own projects, and I'm not included in any of them. \n I think I'm the only person in the entire team who has to do something like this. It feels entirely one-sided. They seem to only want my knowledge without any interest in reciprocating or fostering my growth.\n It's frustrating.\n    submitted by    /u/ShiracoO414  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is your stance on putting settings into the Default Domain Policy (DDP)? \n My Stance\n Over the last 12 years of career, my philosophy is, settings in the DDP are settings that are any settings that are universally true and should not ever be overwritten under any circumstances regardless of what those settings are. \n General Wisdom\n \"As a best practice, you should configure the Default Domain Policy GPO only to manage the default Account Policies settings, Password Policy, Account Lockout Policy, and Kerberos Policy. \" \n Supporting Evidence (My Stance)\n - Settings such as \"Network Security: Force logoff\" are required to be in DDP contradicting their own guidance.\n - AD Engineers I have worked with at previous job specifically stated that guidance was not relevant post Windows Server 2003/ \n My Argument:\n I deem the setting set in the DDP as universally true under any/all circumstances. Settings that no matter the user or computer, must have as part of the mandatory configuration baseline. These are almost all security-relevant settings. Any settings that would deviate from this \"universal truth\" is broken into a separate user/computer policy and applied as/where needed. My goal at the end of the day is K.I.S.S. and to me this the easiest way to achieve that. \n Source(s):\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/dcgpofix\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc779159(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN \n    submitted by    /u/hell_bomb  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically, I'm curating (for now) CISA advisories and adding a security test (scale-ready TTP) to validate that you're devices, if relevant, are protected.\n The first publicly promoted one (there are others avail) is for #CL0p Ransomware + exploitation of MOVEit Vulnerability CVE-2023-34362.\n This tests whether a host is vulnerable to CVE-2023-34362 and attempts to execute techniques associated with Cl0p Ransomware Gang, which is actively exploiting this vulnerability. There is a .go source code file available if you decide you want to see whats running on the endpoint. \n Note: this test utilizes basic port and version verification scanning to identify if an endpoint is vulnerable and does not modify the endpoint in any way. Command execution does not attempt to modify the system in any harmful way.\n Here are the actual steps of the test:\n  \nGet the external IP of the endpoint.\n Exit PROTECTED if unable to determine external IP and continue if not.\n Execute a version check for the applicable MOVEit Transfer version.\n Exit PROTECTED if applicable MOVEit Transfer version is not found and continue if not.\n Execute ingress tool transfer by dropping a pseudo malicious DLL containing Cl0p artifacts to disk.\n Execute a file write containing Cl0p-specific ransom note verbiage to disk.\n Exit PROTECTED if the test is stopped. UNPROTECTED if not.\n  \nGive it a shot. Let me know what you think: https://www.preludesecurity.com/advisories/aa23-158a\n David\n    submitted by    /u/DH_Prelude  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our office is surrounded on most sides by another training provider who seems to think that any and every room they move into needs around 2/3 AP's. We are having issues where their AP's seem to do a channel scan every 30 minutes or so and change their channels around which causes all our AP's to hit 100% interference and connections drop off (We are using Unifi AP's and Controller). On a normal day 2.4Ghz is 100% taken over with their 4 SSID's overlapping themselves and the 5Ghz band is around 80% used up. We have tried to speak to them however they have said that it isn't their problem and suggested we just boost the signal of ours (we tried that for the sake of it but it just ended in more interference) or move all our devices over to 5Ghz which we currently have set to do if the device supports it. We have plenty of AP signal strength to cover the office for both 2.4 and 5Ghz.\n We've wired everyone we can in but the top dogs at the company come in and demand that their teams calls must not drop for even a second while on wifi. Have any of you guys had this kind of issue and how was it resolved/dealt with as me telling and showing them the graphs and stats seem to fall on deaf ears. To add to all this we have also had the students and staff from the other company complain to us because every 30 minutes they all lose connection (which when i suggested they might want to check that setting they ignored).\n    submitted by    /u/matstar862  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR: How does Windows identify known networks?\n ​\n I use Microsoft Always-On VPN, and it uses trusted network detection to determine if it's on or off-prem. Sounds good. It's supposed to use the DNS suffix issued by the DHCP to determine that. Except, it doesn't... It seems to actually use the \"friendly name\" of the network, and therein lies the problem.\n ​\n My internal dns suffix is ad.company.com. I also have wireless for corp-owned devices, which hands out the same suffix. So, random users' laptops may create new known networks with names like \"Corp Wifi 2\" or \"ad.company.com 5\" and can use them interchangeably regardless of whether the device is hardwired or on wireless. Since AOVPN seems to want to use the friendly names instead of the dns suffix like the MS docs say it uses, clients will randomly decide that they're off-prem and connect to the VPN server when they're on-prem breaking any access to internal resources. My temporary workaround has been to blackhole any connections to the VPN server from within the network, but that's causing other weird issues and delays in accessing network resources, though it ultimately does work.\n ​\n But you say, \"just use GPO to create a network profile so the name doesn't change!\" I'm sure you're absolutely correct, but when I'm creating the GPO, it appears to only let me select existing known networks on my computer, and it seems that I too have had those weird incremented network names in the past.\n ​\n Ultimately, my question is, how in the world is Windows fingerprinting the network, and why is it thinking the exact same network is a different one? Looking in the Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\NetworkList\\Profiles\\ registry hive where that info seems to live, I don't see anything like DNS suffixes, subnets, or anything other information that would be used to uniquely identify my corporate network.\n    submitted by    /u/smalltimesysadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is also receiving email from others on that email chain without problem. \n I used mxtoolbox to take a look at the sender domain, and nothing is blacklisted. The email is coming from a Microsoft exchange server from what I can tell. \n There is no block of the domain in our Workspace admin console. \n I did a bit of searching and found this post - https://forum.bestpractical.com/t/inbound-emails-bounce-for-a-specific-active-user/32256 \n But I do not believe the sender is sending from a google account in the first place, and their email account is clearly active. \n The above linked post also points to this google article here, but as the sender does not appear to be using a google account, and our google group is not disabled and is actively sending emails, I am at a loss.\n Any idea how to proceed from here?

This delay is about 5 minutes from our testing but once it has happened and the password box appears then all is fine from then on, no other slowdowns at all. This happens to servers both on the same site and remotely.\n While the delay is happening, there is a screen in the background that you cannot interact with or click to have appear, only if you hover over it from the taskbar do you see it. A screenshot of which is linked here: https://imgur.com/a/9XDdwDH.\n If we delete the cache for RDP (as noted here: https://www.tachytelic.net/2019/01/clear-rdp-cache/) then it works once as normal but the delay occurs again on subsequent connections until the cache is cleared again. I can't see anything in the cache that would cause a delay like this, its only impacting Windows 11 machines and it only started this week.\n Has anyone seen anything like this before?\n    submitted by    /u/NecropolisTD  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a series of background tasks written in Python such as checking for today's date, monitoring my inbox for specific emails, triggering some reminders etc.\n At the moment, I have managed to schedule those tasks to start at a specific date and time, or at specific events using the windows task scheduler (WTS). However, I have come up with several issues:\n 1. For some of these tasks, like the inbox monitoring script, I need them to run continuously in the background, and for some of them I need specific time scheduling (run between this and this date)\n 2. 1. For some of these tasks, I need to implement some stopping clauses (ie. events that terminate these tasks external to the list of events provided by WTS). An example of such, is when some specific file was saving into a folder (the background tasks keeps checking the existence of that folder continuously/periodically) or when an environment variable is modified following another user manipulation.\n 3. It is easy for the user to shut the task by mistake, and I have little to no traceability of these tasks in WTS\n My question is: Do I need to consider a virtual machine or setting up a container (using Windows containers or Docker) to achieve a better orchestration of these tasks? The goal is to have a clearer overview of all the tasks that are running, their state (terminated, failed or running) as well as ensure that I can implement some stopping clauses for these tasks.\n Any help would be much appreciated.

It's like bitlocker is in some legacy mode: https://imgur.com/a/EmNk5Ht\n I can install Windows 10 just fine the same way and bitlocker looks normal.\n So far I've tried to install the os manually from the same image (normal bitlocker), installing the os via opsi without any follow up packages (legacy bitlocker), creating a new winpe for Windows 11 (legacy bitlocker) and different settings in BIOS (legacy bitlocker).\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Typical_Win6265  \n [link]   [comments]",

We already have a normal server with Proxmox as the OS, while this new server would be configured with Windows Server 2022, since we don't need to create VMs on it and installing Nvidia drivers on Windows is less of an headache.\n Is there any platform we can use to manage both servers at the same time, without having different panels for each of them? I've already considered installing Proxmox on the second server and creating a cluster with both of them, but it would be necessary to configure PCI passthrough for the GPU to work with the VMs, and as for all I've read it is not really stable, so I would really like to avoid it, if there are any other ways. \n Thanks!

          "description": "Hello, \n In our current situation we have a large portion of our infrastructure being managed by the IT department of our parent company. Everything down to the ESXI hosts are their responsibility, while the virtual servers of our factories are our own responsibility. This works reasonably well, although I wouldn't mind having my own team doing the managing like I am used to at other jobs (lets just say we have had our issues with the IT department, like them running WEP SSID's till end 2022). \n Anyway, when we run a project we request a new virtual server, they deploy one via a template and we get on our way. We use their KMS server to activate our Windows products and occasionally when there is Office on the server installed to activate that too. \n Now we run into the situation that we are most likely being sold. The IT manager of our parent company informed us today that they do not want to assist with creating new servers (requested 10 more) because when moving to the new owner they expect us to create new servers with them and moving the application and data over, and not move the virtual servers itself. \n The servers run in our own domain separate from the parent company, meaning they have no cached administrative credentials or anything like that saved on our VMs that could potentially leak. Their reasoning for migrating applications + data rather than the VM itself is because of Windows licensing. But from my limited experience with KMS a Windows server will contact the KMS to renew their activation every X months. Surely we could simply release the current licenses being assigned to our servers via KMS, switch over to the KMS of the new owner and bobs your uncle? \n Or does KMS licensing work differently? \n Any insight would be appreciated! \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Dennis-sysadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

They leave the printer up, and I take the time to send a printout and trace it through the output server and watch it route to China with no error. The next day they say there is no output.\n I logged into the HP print server page, and there is nothing showing an error, except the toner is at 5%. I type up a ‘hello world’ in notepad, hook up my window desktop to it, and print. No errors. I follow it immediately with another server print.\n Just heard from them that nothing showed up.

Since it would be much easier and faster to move the HBA and hard drives to the other server then it would be to replace the motherboard, that’s what I did.\n I didn’t move the processors or the RAM. The replacement server has 32GB of RAM and faster processors, so that’s fine (more than overkill) for a NAS.\n After the swap I reconfigured the BIOS, and the server came right up, added the Static IP and bingo, everything is back online, total time from initial call to completed server replacement 3 hours. \n I’m feeling pretty great right now.

These servers need to connect to the internet so you can use them, I make sure these connections all work fast and for 1000s of devices”\n Really the launching point of this question is someone in my family equated data center with warehouse which made them think I was basically moving around boxes. This prompted them to ask if I was a manager or warehouse manager and when I said no they said that our other relative could put a good word in at the candy factory they work at that I should consider it. \n I understand not knowing the ins and outs of a job because most people don’t know that for most jobs but to not even have a high level concept of it was a bit mind boggling especially since they equated it to something very random. \n So how does everyone else explain what they do to non-tech/IT/etc folks and more importantly do people actually understand at all?\n    submitted by    /u/bender_the_offender0  \n [link]   [comments]",

The IT staff all have secondary admin accounts that have admin access to their laptops, these are also active directory accounts. \n Now for the issue, we all WFH at least three days a week which is great. However, there seems to be an issue with Windows 11 caching the credentials for our standard accounts. Let's say I work from the office on Monday, on Tuesday morning I can turn on my laptop at home and log in with my standard account just fine and connect to the VPN and work the entire day without issue. At the end of the day, I disconnect from the VPN and shut down my laptop or maybe I just lock it after disconnecting as I will be using it the next day (this is the most common). The next morning when I attempt to log on I receive the message that I cannot be logged in because my domain cannot be reached. The following is the process I have to go through to get logged in with my standard account.\n Log in with my admin account (for some reason this works just fine off the network, most likely due to being a local admin account)\n Connect to the VPN while logged in with my admin account\n Switch user and log in with my standard account\n Once logged in with my standard account, reboot the laptop, log back in with my standard account, reconnect to the VPN, and begin my day.\n This was not an issue on previous Windows 10 and 7 laptops so I am not sure what is causing this on 11, and it seems like it has gotten worse with recent updates.

          "description": "I raised a case with Mimecast support querying whether there was some kind of wider DDoS against Mimecast going on between 14th May and 9th June, but they neither confirmed nor denied anything so thought I'd ask the community.\n We received our Monthly Account Assessment over the weekend and noticed an abnormally high number of inbound rejections towards the beginning of the month. Looking back at the same report for May we can see these started on 14th May. Normal daily inbound email values for us are around 10,000 and we can see these hitting 100,000+ through this period.\n Having dug into the rejections deeper using the info within Reporting -> CSV in the Mimecast portal it reads like a DDoS attack with multiple source IP addresses and randomised FROM addresses. The TO addresses are also randomised, so it doesn’t seem like a targeted attack from that point of view.\n Our main concern is that the TO domains extend to all our domains within both our Mimecast and 365 tenant, some of which are not in the wild as such and would normally see very few inbound emails. It’s as though someone had a complete list of our domains and sent high amounts of email to randomised addresses in a DoS attempt. Mimecast did its thing as these were rejected due to the sending IPs being in RBLs.\n We’re trying to determine whether this was unique to our organisation or whether Mimecast customers as a whole were targeted.\n Did anyone else experience this at all?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/brepmassive  \n [link]   [comments]",

If anyone knows of any existing datasets that fit this criterion, I would greatly appreciate any information or links you can provide.\n Alternatively, if there isn't a readily available dataset, I would be more than willing to create my own dataset by classifying payload data myself. If any of you have access to a collection of payload data or any logs or know of any resources where I could find such data, I would be extremely grateful.

The systems currently have individual data of each of our organization members' company user profiles along with maybe secondary HDDs of sizes varying from 500GB-2TB. We would only expect to move the primary drive which is usually no more than 1TB in size, average is 500GB.\n As this will be a large task for our small team to migrate the data from the existing drive to a new drive-through normal (home user) imaging tools the work is expected to take a few weeks or months to complete for all 1000 systems. \n A few considerations we are still uncertain on:\n  \nIf any suggestions on professional imaging tools are there for moving the content from the old (HDD) physical drive to the new (SSD) drive that can give us a rollout of maybe 100 systems per day over network backup/restore imaging methods then we can consider this. Have any approached something like this procedure before?\n If we are buying the SSDs in bulk as all the same model and capacity, we should not expect much fuss from Windows OS in the hardware imaging process as no other components (like motherboard, GPU, etc.) are being changed right?\n Should we expect potential data loss from bad sectors in existing HDDs being cloned to SSDs, maybe OS blue screen errors as the data might not be perfect in the old HDD?\n Any other precautions we should expect if we plan to do this in-house?\n  \nWe are considering outsourcing this task to a vendor for fixed SLAs and agreements and having our users up and running in a known timeline with the least amount of downtime. I am not sure whether they will have data loss in their contract.\n Let me know what you think is the best approach here.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Klipspringer112  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought it should be peanuts to do, but of course he couldn't make it too easy.\n Underneath the Projects folder we have 276 seperate folders, one for each project.\n What the customer wants is that we export each direct subfolder into a separate PST file. To make it more clear let's say we have 'Project A', 'Project B', 'Project C' folders. They sit directly under the 'Projects' PF. What the customer doesn't want is to have a 'ProjectS.pst' file from which he could scroll through the folder hierarchy, no. What he wants is to have a pst-file for 'Project A.pst', 'Project B.pst', which only opens the folder structure he needs at that moment.\n Do you guys have any ideas?

Upon investigating, my techs found that the computers (Optiplex 7090 micros) would be normal sleep mode, and moving the mouse caused the power light to go solid and the fan to spin up, then... nothing. We got about 10 reports of this, out of a fleet of at least 50 of that model among our branch offices.\n There had been a recent BIOS update, so we tried rolling it back. That seemed to help for one or two boots, then back to the original problem. We pulled one of the computers, gave the employee a loaner, and started a deeper investigation. \n So many tests. Every power setting in Windows and BIOS. Windows 10 vs Windows 11, M.2 Drives vs SATA, RST vs AHCI, rolling back recent updates... The whiteboard filled up with things we tried. Certain things would seem to work, then the computer would adapt like Borg to a phaser and the wake issue would recur.\n After a clean Windows install, one of my techs noticed that it seemed to only happened when the computer was joined to the domain. We checked into that, and sure enough, that was the case. Ok, a weird policy issue, finally getting somewhere. There was only one policy dealing with power, so we disabled that. No change.\n Finally, we created an Isolation Ward OU, and started adding GPOs one by one. Finally one seemed to be causing the wake issue... but it made no sense. It was a policy that ran a script on shutdown, that logged information to the Description field in Windows- Computer name, serial number, things like that. No power policies, it didn't even run on wake.\n We tested it thoroughly, and it seems definitive: A shutdown policy, that runs a script to log a few lines of system information, was causing a wake from sleep issue, but only on a subset of a specific model of a computer.\n My head hurts.\n    submitted by    /u/JasonMaggini  \n [link]   [comments]",

My predecessor would keep images of each desktop by model and processor. Right now we are using Dell desktops, and HP laptops. I was thinking we really just need to keep maybe 2 images? One for desktop, one for laptops. The desktops are 8th and 9th gen Intel CPUs, where the laptops are 8th to 11th gen Intel CPUs. I am using DISM to apply and capture images, and I sysprep the images. These are all \"thin\" images, just Windows 10 that was installed on them and decrapified/customized to our liking to get rid of OEM bloatware and keep the image size down. We will add to domain and install SCCM, etc later. Any reason to keep more than one image for each type of hardware/manufacturer? I know sysprep generalizes the image, removing hardware identifiers and such, and Windows 10 is pretty forgiving when it comes to different hardware. I just need to run Updates on the hardware after imaging, which I am already doing, correct? I tried googling this, but maybe not phrasing it correctly and just would like some advice from veterans.

          "description": "Hyia, we're currently moving to a new school site and this will be the occasion to rearrange configuration and settings.\n We currently have these VLANs:\n  \nCore: Servers and on premise trusted workstations\n Staff: BYOD and mobile phones\n Guest: Students and guests\n Printers: to allow selected VLANs to print\n PBX: as it says\n  \nNow, apart from adding a videosurveillance system, which will use its own VLAN, we're wondering if it makes sense to separate servers (Active Directory) from on premise trusted workstations. \n What we would achieve: \n  \nSecurity: By segregating servers and workstations, you create a logical separation between them. This helps in implementing stricter security policies and access controls. Even if the server firewall is compromised, an attacker would still need to bypass additional security measures to gain access to the workstations' network.\n Reduced Attack Surface: Placing servers and workstations on separate VLANs limits the exposure of critical server resources to potential threats originating from workstations. It minimizes the attack surface, reducing the chances of unauthorized access, data breaches, or lateral movement within the network.\n Performance Optimization: Servers often require more bandwidth and have different traffic patterns compared to workstations. By segregating them on separate VLANs, you can prioritize and optimize network resources for server traffic, ensuring efficient communication and reducing the risk of congestion caused by workstation-related traffic.\n  \nNow thinking of the extra complexity layer added by the above setup. Implementing Inter-VLAN Routing, to allow for controlled communication between VLANs. By selectively permitting specific traffic between VLANs, you can ensure that essential services, such as DNS, DHCP, domain authentication, print queues, and file shares, remain accessible to workstations but this might be a long trial and error process\n Your thoughts? \n    submitted by    /u/_ReeX_  \n [link]   [comments]",

We get the standard corporate crap like heavy lifting, gdpr, modern slavery, etc etc but no training for our roles.\n As an example, we've recently moved over to azure and although I have quite a lot of access within it, I have received zero training on it from the business. The access for the team gets less as you go down the levels e.g. 1st line and 2nd line have restricted access and can only do certain things like add someone to a group.\n We have a knowledge base but I wouldn't say it's the best - we do try to keep it up to date though as much as possible. \n What does your company offer you? If anything? Or do you just learn in your own time? \n I'm interested to find out if anybody has time set aside for them to train e.g. Comptia courses, azure fundamentals - stuff like that. \n I find I have to use my own time to train which I don't think I should be doing.\n    submitted by    /u/VanDran85  \n [link]   [comments]",

The one quantifiable I don't include in figures is staffing to run the physical hardware, mainly because from experience outside of replacing hardware, our team going to server room is probably a once a month event. Running a VM in VMware doesn't need more manpower than running on Aws. The fact the move back to on prem required no extra staff is a confirmation of this.\n    submitted by    /u/Gods-Of-Calleva  \n [link]   [comments]",

These events are network related as the logon type is 3.\n The status code indicates - STATUS_UNFINISHED_CONTEXT_DELETED\n A security context was deleted before the context was completed.

I'm looking for a career change for a few reasons, 1) moar money, duh. 2) WFH FTW!. 3)More options in the future.\n We're all familiar with the dead end tech support, customer support positions so I'm not gonna go into that rant/vent here. As I've always learn by doing, I hardly have certificate/certifcations under my belt to show for what I can do.\n What I can do: recently got CCNA, CCNP is well within reason. LPIC-1 is probably low hanging fruit too, might strive for LPIC-2. Most recent dabbling with python & powershell. Not a front end guy, but back end, bring it on.\n So, I'm going to hunker down and get certs to try and get myself another position. The way I see it, I can either go into product customer support, which would somewhat limit myself to my employer's products, but that can be lucrative. Or go into DevOps/SRE/Data Analyst.\n Any advice on which to focus on, or something else I'm not aware of, and the path to it, that'll be great. WFH is definitely a must for me, as I planned to WFH and move some place with lower cost of living before my current job which doesn't allow WFH. If I can manage to double employ down the road, even better.\n So lay it on me, guys.\n    submitted by    /u/x_m_n  \n [link]   [comments]",

First time posting here, I hope it’s not a duplicate.\n I’ve been desperately trying to figure out a solution to this issue that was assigned to me by my senior team member, thus leading me here.\n We have two Synology NAS (DS920+), each loaded with 14TBx4 disks. The first one is used as main storage, we got the same one to expand our storage, and I figured it’s easier from a client’s pov to have both NASes joined together as a whole storage.\n What i came up with was mount both nfs shares on a VM, unify them with mergerfs and then re-export from VM. It worked but as my senior team member said it’s a single point of failure, therefore I duplicated the VM then spawned another one as a load balancer (HAProxy), but in the end it did not work as NFS refused to mount the LB IP.\n I want to know if it’s possible to unify them under a shared volume or one NFS export.\n I heard about Ganesha and gluster fs but I did not find anything or anyone using it for a similar use case of mine.\n Does anyone have an idea how to scale out nas synology?

I configured it based on the configuration of the switch that went bad. I could have swore it was a /23 network.\n This, of course, was a weekend, and come Monday we had endpoints with “stuck” IP addresses that refused to renew, and weird SIP problems where calls went through without problem, but conversations were suddenly muted. I suspected a NAT problem so I went on the hunt. Two days later I still found nothing and felt defeated.\n So, there are a number of issues that lead to this, many of which “existed before me”, but I’m here now and the bottom line is it was my fault. The big boss figured it out and all I could do was slap myself on the forehead. It was originally a /24 network. We reconfigured the PBX and all downstream appliances to use a /23 space. Within 10 minutes all was well.\n Lesson learned was always verify the IP space you are working in. I could have saved myself a lot of time, frustration and embarrassment.\n BTW: I know this is more netadmin stuff. Like many of us my sysadmin duties really run the gamut.

          "description": "So, our engineers have been tasked with setting up a 12 server (Windows 2019 Server) environment to run software for a manufacturing plant. These were likely member servers that were dis-joined from their domain and placed within their own domain. One of the tasks I was given was to harden the security via GPOs. \n The second I popped into Group Policy Editor, I was greated with a warning that was something to the effect that it couldn't sync (I forgot exactly what it was when I looked at it yesterday). It does appear that it retained some of the previous policies from the previous domain. I created some of the policies like not allowing anonoymous logins and basic objects of that sort, but some of them lost out on the winning GPO that was in place. I deleted a few of them, but they are sticking on the other servers creating issues with service accounts that the software needs to run. I even tried writing new policies to reverse them, but am still having issues with them sticking. \n I know the proper thing to do would be to rebuild the entire domain, but we don't have the time frame given to us to complete. I'm probably just overthinking this, but is there a way to rip everything out and redo all of the policies? TIA!!!\n    submitted by    /u/BleedCheese  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our storage arrays are a Dell VNXe 3200 which is long out of support and a Unity 300 and HPE Nimble that are going up next year. My original thought was to replace all of it with a new HCI cluster but there is a fear that it's \"too much\" for our environment of about 40 VMs. As a result, I've been asked to look into a traditional SAN solution to replace it instead. \n Considering what we have, the most cost-effective option would seem to replacing all 3 storage arrays with 2 new storage arrays, keeping the R740xd's while dropping the 3 other hosts, and adding in one new host. It would be the minimum amount of hardware to replace and while it kicks the can down the road on our remaining hosts, we'd have over two years before they need to be replaced.\n Any thoughts or other suggestions that I may be overlooking?\n    submitted by    /u/vtvincent  \n [link]   [comments]",

But it takes time and it's still used for servers and a bunch of legacy stuff. Either way our offboarding procedure is just weird to me. It works, bjt we have a tonne of disabled users and the number only grows. \n Currently our procedure is as follows:\n  \n Right away:\n  \nUser is disabled disabled\n \nPassword is reset reset\n \nuser is removed from all groups (effectivly removing licences as this is applied using groups)\n \nuser is added to a single group that gives them an exchange online plan 1 license license\n \nuser is converted to a shared mailbox\n \n -1 other user gets access to their mailbox and 1 forward is made. To the same user or another user( chosen by the manager)\n  \n After 2 months:\n  \nadd old_ prefix to users mail address and UPN UPN\n \nremove delegation and forward\n \n  \n Now i guess my question is, at what point do we just delete the user account?

          "description": "I'm making my first attempt at setting up FOG Server to deploy images for 4 different Windows 11 buildouts that will need to go onto mix of desktops and laptops. I've been able to get all the way through registering an image, but I'm stuck at deployment. I'm still trying to figure this thing out, and I feel like I'm missing something simple.\n I'm using VirtualBox to create the VMs for the FOG host, FOG server, and the Windows 11 golden image. The FOG host is Ubuntu Server 22.04, FOG Server is version 1.5.10. DHCP is set to the FOG Server IP in 066, and I have 067 set to snponly.efi. On the golden image, I have generic apps (Chrome, Everything, VLC Player, Office365,) as well as larger installs for SolidEdge and AutoCAD Viewer. I went through sysprep and created an answer file for unattended installation for UEFI, and have a volume license key as well, so I'm covered there. I then was able to successfully register and then capture the image in FOG.\n ​\n Where I'm stuck: I've tried deploying this on a physical desktop as well as a VM, and this is as far as I get:\n Filename: snponly.efi\n thtp://10.xx.xx.xx/snponly.efi... ok\n snponly.efi : 274944 bytes [PXE-NBP (may be EFI?)]\n Nothing happens beyond that point. I've tried using ipxe.efi as the boot file, and I get the error could not boot image: exec format error. I feel like this is something simple that I'm overlooking. \n Any help and/or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Weary_Attorney_5308  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I do pro bono work for a nonprofit organization. They called me on Wednesday morning and informed me that some websites were not working for all users. Additionally, Outlook had issues. Upon investigation, I discovered that major websites like YouTube and Facebook were displaying SSL certificate errors. In the Chrome web console, I noticed recurring reconnection errors. The organization mentioned that they had recently upgraded their Comcast connection and were told that their modem was outdated. Consequently, I advised them to contact Comcast and request a replacement. A technician replaced the modem, tested it, and confirmed that all sites were functioning properly on his PC.\n However, when I reevaluated the situation tonight, I discovered that connecting a PC directly to the modem resulted in the same issue. Changing the DNS settings did not resolve the problem. After spending two hours troubleshooting, I found a temporary fix by enabling DNS over HTTPS, which resolved the issue for everything except Outlook.\n I am aware that this is not a long-term solution. Based on my best guess, this appears to be an issue with Comcast. However, persuading them to acknowledge and address the problem may prove challenging since they rely on the Comcast modem for DNS and DHCP services. Since not all devices support DNS over HTTPS, I need to find an alternative solution.\n    submitted by    /u/neckbeard404  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then there is just plain malware and zero day flaws between updates to do this if the attacker gets on a perfectly patched system. Users can be tricked into clicking on malicious links and opening files with malware and there is even occasional malware that requires no user interaction (Malvertisements and Outlook flaws that allow malware to run without even opening the message).\n You can have A/V and EDR to detect and block tools like Mimikatz, but Mimikatz does not need to run locally on the system. In the video, the data is copied to a different system with Mimikatz installed. No hacking tools need to be installed on the system being attacked.\n Besides all that can be done with the local user's Azure credentials to send spam and phishing emails and exfiltrate data, if any device admins had entered their credentials into the system (UAC prompt etc.) to assist the user within the last 14 days, their active PRT will also be on the machine and that would give the attacker access to everything the device admin has access to in the tenant.\n This type of attack gets around credential guard and TPM protections and then bypasses all forms of MFA and passwordless authentication (FIDO2 security keys etc.).

Is there anything like it for Windows, i.e. something which would allow you to authenticate/log-in to a computer upon startup - either bypassing or being used in conjunction with a password or other Windows Hello auth method? \n Without going into too much detail, I've got a working agent, and USB device which stores/generates a pub/priv key pair. Furthermore, I've managed to make an SSH connection to my machine, from my machine. \n Thanks! \n    submitted by    /u/DontGrowAttached  \n [link]   [comments]",

To visualize her new classroom, imagine a square with the white board and smart projector installed on the front wall. \n The back wall is cabinets and counter tops from one side to the other. Also on the back wall and above the countertops, is the ethernet port for her computer, printer, and the phone line for her classroom phone. The pervious teacher was clearly using the countertop as her desk, which kept her back to the kids, forced her to sit on a stool, and block some cabinets with her desk. \n Ideally, my wife would like to have her computer/desk at the front of the room, so that she can face her students while at her desk. This would require 30 foot of cords to cross the room. Is there some way to have her computer at the front of the room, without cords, and still be plugged in to the ethernet? \n Any help or advice would be appreciated. \n    submitted by    /u/PapaZedruu  \n [link]   [comments]",

The network/domain infrastructure was built by a contracting company and I swear it was designed to be broken from day one. There are 50+ virtualized servers to manage and I barely know anything about them because I came here two years after the installation and the previous sysadmins were hotshots that only applied bandaid fixes so they couldn’t tell me anything of value. The only people that saw how it ran as intended are long gone and I’m stuck piecing together whatever I can with my limited experience. Getting information out of the contracting company is next to impossible because I have to fight my way through their help desk that of course only answer to emails. And even then they are intentionally vague in order to bait my company to pay extra to go fly over to fix whatever’s wrong. I might as well not even be here. The contractors were supposed to build the network then hire junior techs to maintain it but how am I supposed to maintain anything when it’s all hidden behind a contract. I have full access to the network. Im not just a user with limited access. Yet I feel like im running into a new major issue every week and nothing is ever a quick fix or even something I’ve dealt with before. It almost feels like it was engineered to be complicated and they convinced their clients to hire under qualified techs so they can get more money to fly out and be the “subject matter experts”. I’m so sick and tired of this, it’s actually killed my desire to continue working in this field because I’m being set up left and right by these greedy fucks.\n    submitted by    /u/shaggymink_577  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are in the process of renewing our RDP deployment in Azure. The current servers are all Server 2012 and since this OS will be end of support by October 2023, we have created a new deployment with all Server 2022 VM's.\n We provide our applications within the RDP deployment as RemoteApp. Users can acces the RDWeb page through URL cloud.example.com where they have to login and then see the icon(s) of the applications they can use. \n When the new environment is fully functional, we will point the DNS server to the IP address of the new RDWeb server, but we are not yet fully ready for that. When we open the RDWeb from within the server, we can login and start an application, but when we try to do that from outside the environment (by IP address, ie https://123.12.3.4/rdweb/pages/en-US/default.aspx) we still can login to the server but applications won't open. Instead, an error message is shown:\n  \nRemoteApp Disconnected \n Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer \"cb.cloud.example.com\" for one of these reasons: \n 1) Your user account is not authorized to access the RD Gateway \"cloud.example.com\"\n 2) Your computer is not authorized to access the RD Gateway \"cloud.example.com\"\n 3) You are using an incompatible authentication method (for example, the RD Gateway might be expecting a smart card but you provided a password) \n Contact your network administrator for assistance.\n  \n​\n We are not sure why this is happening. Could this be because we are not accessing the environment by the domain cloud.example.com but by IP address? Any suggestions on where to look at are welcome. \n Of course, I would prefer to test accessing the RemoteApp over the domain name, but unfortunately this requires help from external parties that are not available to me at the moment.\n    submitted by    /u/wholesaleworldwide  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have power shell scrips ready to maintain what we have (e.g. global address list). I’m hesitant to just uninstall exchange server all as there’s no undo for that.

I've had to consult a number of books, online blogs, YouTube videos, my own lab packet captures, etc. to figure this out. It's a bit of a visual mess due to the number of moving parts involved but maybe this may be useful to some people and/or they can provide suggestions for improvements. Making these diagrams is sort of a side hobby for me.\n    submitted by    /u/ExpendableEnsign  \n [link]   [comments]",

From the services console, I get an access denied. When I try it through the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services) I get an access denied as well.\n It is not possible (as far as I have tried) to change the permissions on the services and program files or gain ownership. I tried running the commandline as SYSTEM (psexec -i -s cmd.exe), still access denied.\n I tried some consumer tools to remove it.

I am paid an ungodly amount of money to do this job, and I feel like I am absolutely horrible at this.\n Whenever I report a vulnerability, the IT manager ALWAYS comes back at me saying that he doesnt believe the risk is there and that the system doesnt need to be patched.

Pwning a UPS or some other IoT device can lead to lateral movement, especially when we have no XDR solution and rely only on EDR. I believe some of the issue can come from him being 40 years older than me. He says I go off buzz words too much. Its quite clear he does not like me, and honestly I am ok with that. It just makes my job harder when they dont want to patch internal systems because the risk is not there.\n This makes me feel like I dont know what I am doing.

          "description": "Just started doing some work for a customer who has a Windows Storage Server 2016 machine purchased from Dell.\n They would like to upgrade. They purchased Server 2019, licenses and cals (several years ago and its been sitting around collecting dust which is why they brought me on board as a consultant to do the upgrade, previous employee who managed their machines retired to florida during covid lockdowns), but it appears it is not possible to upgrade from Storage Server 2016 to 2019. Only a fresh installation is available on the setup screen.\n This makes sense I guess, since it would be like upgrading DataCenter 2016 to Standard 2019.\n However, the machine is not using any special features of Storage Server. Its just the version that came with the machine because I guess it had a MD1200 array attached to it.\n A fresh install really isn't an option either since there are a few other pieces of software on here (a SQL Server 2019 instance and some CRM software supplied by a 3rd party vendor which runs through IIS and uses the SQL database to store data).\n I am guessing when they got the CRM software w/ SQL 2019, they got the Windows Server 2019 disk to upgrade and ran into this problem so \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\". Bringing the CRM vendor on-site to do a re-install would be expensive and they'd like to avoid it. This customer does not have internet access for their network so remote vpn isn't an option there. Someone has to fly in.\n So, is there any way to get server 2019 installed on this box w/o a format, e.g.\n a) can I somehow change the product key on the existing Windows Storage Server 2016 install to a Windows Server Standard 2016 product key and then do the \"upgrade\" (I did try this but it says my windows server 2016 product key is invalid, which I know it isn't, since its in use on a real 2016 server at the moment (e.g. \"downgrade\" the server), or\n b) can I somehow 'trick' the installation process to ignore the version?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/DisposableAccount712  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For decades, I have used Windows Task Scheduler to run small processing jobs nightly. Currently, these are Server 2019 systems in question. Sometime in the last month, some of the jobs which rely heavily on the \"run as user\" context to gain access to specific resources started failing. When taking a closer look at these failing jobs, it appears that they are no longer \"running as\" the user which they are assigned. They are failing in different ways, too -- for instance, one job uses SQL Server Integrated security to login and retrieve data from a SQL Server, others move files around to different servers and need to have specific access to access these shares. It's all failing now.\n These aren't new jobs, they're ones which have been running successfully daily for years. I've done all the obvious things like tried to re-create the jobs with no avail. The jobs run fine if I run them manually under the context of the users they're expected to run as, like starting powershell as the user, or logging into the system as the user. They just no longer run through Task Scheduler.\n My environment IS a subset of a larger Active Directory with AD Admins for the environment that do have management abilities like applying group policies and the such. When asking these admins if they've applied any security settings over the last month, I've been met with a lot of shrugs and \"I don't think anything has changed\". Of course, I can see the applied policies but have no idea which, if any, have been added or modified in the last 30 days or so.\n So, I'm reaching out here and asking if perhaps any of you folks might have an inkling on what could be going on, or if there might be a GPO setting you can think of that could have been turned on or modified that my effect the Task Scheduler in this way. I would be open to any thoughts to suggestions, as I feel like the ability to run a job as another user is a key feature in Task Scheduler and without it, it's relatively useless.\n    submitted by    /u/MakisupaVT  \n [link]   [comments]",

No word on how this will be fixed or when.\n Restored internet connectivity by integrating a fallback connection with same router but another provider (thankfully had everything physically set up, but planned configuring in a few days), but i am still so incredibly angry at all this.

This particular colleague is a “senior”. \n Anyway this particular colleague is asking me for help with their tasks multiple times a day. I have tried my best to help them where I can without giving them direct instructions or answers, for example providing documentation or asking them questions to guide them to the answers in the hope that they will learn better that way. \n However just lately I have felt drained by this, they continue to push and push till I’m basically at a point where I have to give them the answer else i won’t get any of my own work done.\n This week for example, they have taken a simple task in AWS which would take about 2/3 hour if you want to automate it with terraform (I don’t want to give too many specifics in case they are lurking). This job has now been going on for over a week still not completed it with almost daily questions about very basic things or asking to fix errors they are getting. To be clear this person has been working with terraform for almost 2 years at this point and was employed as a senior cloud engineer so it’s not like this person has just been dropped into something they shouldn’t or don’t understand.\n How is the best way of approaching this situation, I would like to get my time back and stop supporting this colleague so much. However, at the same time I don’t want to be considered unreasonable by refusing to help?\n Maybe I made this situation worse by helping in the first place I don’t know. I would appreciate other peoples thoughts on the matter and how to progress this situation.\n    submitted by    /u/linezman22  \n [link]   [comments]",

We recently bought two (2) new workstations and noticed that neither of them were getting any signal from the ethernet/switch (computer said no ethernet cable connected). I troubleshooted it for a while and noticed that every time I disabled the ethernet adapter, the lights on the ethernet port starting to show some data. To me, this seem like a driver or Windows issue so I updated the drivers using the latest one from the MB's website with no success. I also clean installed Windows and no success.\n One thing I did notice is that they would get internet if the connection was bridged. For example, our VoIP phones have a PC port. When bringing a cable from the VoIP port, the computer would get internet. I also tried with a 5 port switch and it actually worked too. It seems that the issue is when connected directly to the wall.\n When I noticed that everything worked when not plugged directly to the wall, I started to mess around the connection on the switch and no matter what I did the issue was always there. What seems strange to me is that no other workstation that are already there present similar issue. I even connected the computer to one port that was already working for someone else and the PC will not recognize the ethernet cable.\n I grab the computers and brought them to a different floor and they work fine when connected directly to the wall. This makes me think that it could be a switch related issue. This is the first time I come across something like this in my work experience. I have called a couple of friends who were also clueless on what could be the issue.\n Any advise will be greatly appreciated!!\n    submitted by    /u/monedadeoro  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well, I guess that's a pretty solid 'F you' and we'll now have to review our options. I guess this might drive some license fees out of us, but it might as easily push us to 'never RedHat'.

Any advice is appreciated, thanks.\n EDIT: this got way more responses than i anticipated! i dont have time today to reapond to everyone, but i have lots to consider now. I feel a lot better about the situation after reading so many perspectives. thank you guys so much for the insightful advice.\n    submitted by    /u/neptunium45  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a VMware ESXi server, and to simplify things let's say it currently has 10 VMs, each VM having a management NIC, and a customer VLAN NIC. Currently I can use a service like NRPE to execute commands on each VM, and NRPE runs a networking command (like a cURL, ping, or similar) over the customer network NIC. The NRPE agent listens on the management NIC, but executes the commands over the customer VLAN NIC.\n Customer wise, for simplicity we'll say customers are called Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, and so on. Their VLANs correspond like 10, 20, 30, and so on. Each customer network has an identical IP space of 10.0.0.0/8, and the IP of this VM will be identical in each of the networks.\n I'm building a new VM which has a single management NIC, and a single trunk NIC (VLAN 4095 in VMware parlance). I've tested configuring the secondary NIC on the VM as Customer1 with VLAN 10 tagged, and that works fine (so the port is all good), but I'm having trouble with network namespaces. My end goal is to be able to run commands like ip netns exec customer1 ping 8.8.8.8 and get the results (quick crap example, but you get the idea).\n I tried to borrow the principles from [this article] but it wouldn't work for me. \n Is what I'm trying to do possible?\n    submitted by    /u/iDemonix  \n [link]   [comments]",

No matter how many minutes i select in GPO and apply it I always see the same result. If the Windows are not locked then it works like expected.\n Only if I set the display to never turn off (so 0 in GPO) and never on energy settings in Windows does the monitor stay awake - but this is not something that we want. After you are not around for 15-20 minutes there is no reason to keep the monitors turned on.\n Hybrid sleep is off. The monitor settings have been checked multiple times, there is no any power saving mode active. The same thing happens if the laptop is on its own, the display will turn off in a matter of seconds. I did not check the bios settings, but this should not cause the problem?\n ​\n Cheers!\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Master_Kidfisto  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Lately I’ve been looking to see if there are any native options there that support cloud file share as well as a similar fashion of ACLs and locking down folder permissions likely your typical NTFS shares. \n Our environment has a presence of AADDS (Azure AD domain services), however, this isn’t on-prem and it’s soely used for virtual machines, only. \n Our machines are AAD Cloud joined, and our user identities are also cloud sourced. From looking, the only native option for file share in Azure is Azure Files, and it doesn’t support NTFS permissions, plus only works with storage account keys. You can only truly use Kerberos and ACL permissions if your identities are hybrid, (the devices can still be AAD joined in this case) \n Given the fact that, if we were to have our identities hybrid, we’d be able to receive Kerberos tickets on an AAD joined machine, in result this opens a few doors for us, without even having the need to hybrid join machines. \n The other option would be to dump 10+ TB into sharepoint, however, to me, that makes absolutely no sense as Sharepoint Online is not meant to replace a file system. \n Thoughts? Would it better a better option to ditch the managed domain in AADDS and move to ADDS? Users would be hybrid, devices would still be cloud joined. So it wouldn’t necessarily be completely moving to “on-prem”, plus if we already have and utilize Azure AD domain services, I don’t really see a point in it, being that Azure AD domain services is extremely limited and probably better for a mom & pop shop type of environment.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Hearing3804  \n [link]   [comments]",

Furthermore, we have not had any reports from MacOS users yet, only windows users. All windows machines running the latest OS updates.\n Updating to the latest version of chrome does not resolve the issue. Older versions, beta, etc also experience the issue.\n My suspicion is that there is an issue relating to both windows/chrome interacting together that is causing the SSL/Initial Connection to hang for a long period of time when loading pages.

Nothing special there.\n We do have a few Linux servers running as well, since we have some solutions that either require Linux or just \"belongs\" on Linux. Right now we just have non-managed admin accounts for each admin on these servers, but that really doesn't comply with best practices and our own policies. It's mostly Ubuntu Server 20.04 and 22.04, so is there an easy way to either join them to Active Directory for managing these admin accounts, or create an alternative user directory just for these servers? I guess that Active Directory would be the best solution.\n We don't need much in term of functionality, \"just\" a simple but stable way to manage admin accounts.

I planned everything out and we had the cutover yesterday. We had a few little easily solvable issues, but only one persistent one that I can't seem to figure out.\n We have two mitel5000 phone systems. The original configuration had both uplinks to those system set as access, so I just mirrored that on the Meraki. both phone systems have two IP addresses and on both phone systems only one of the two is showing online. In the office, its sporadic, but some phones are online and some are stuck on contacting server.\n We just use VLAN1 for voip, and the VLAN DHCP Relays are working fine with everything else. I can ping both phone system gateways from the 192.168.1.1 subnet on the meraki, but every other subnet fails.\n Networking is far from my forte, so this may well be something stupid easy, but it's got me stumped so any help is appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Statuslol  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Like many people currently, I just moved a handful of domains away from Google Domains. As expected, all domain transfers added one year to the expiration, except one.\n This one domain was \"auto renewed\" at Google domains just over a week before being transferred. The transfer did not add a year to the expiration. I asked the new registrar what happened and they said the domain was in the auto-renewal grace period, which occurs after a domain has expired. I thought there's no way, Google auto renewed the domain, how could it have expired?\n So I started looking at my Google domain transactions. If the transaction dates are anything to go by, the domain was originally purchased at X time. The \"auto renew\" transaction happened one year later on the same date, but at X + just under two hours. So it appears Google domains let this domain expire for almost two hours before the \"auto renew\" took place. This put the domain into the grace period which means when I transferred it, no additional year was added.\n Again, this is what appears to have happened. Going off of transaction times and the fact that the transfer didn't add a year to the expiration. Google domains says the auto renew feature is supposed to renew a domain within a month before expiration. It seems like they didn't and cost me a year's worth of registration. Not a lot of money, but what bothers me more is thinking my domain may not have been working, which I use mainly for email, for almost two hours before the auto renew happened. And I probably wouldn't have noticed if I didn't transfer it.\n If anyone from Google domains is here, you owe me $12.\n    submitted by    /u/brsh2  \n [link]   [comments]",

The configuration profile marks as successful, but in the security admin center under device inventory I don't currently see any devices listed in there. I have created some AV policies but AFAIK they are not working (for example I tried to disable the user from being able to open defender settings, and currently I can still override my AV settings just by going through the Windows Defender security settings).\n I downloaded and ran some well known malware (mimikatz) and was able to launch and run commands in mimikatz. About 5 mins of the computer sitting idle, I heard a few notifications come in saying \"Enterprise unwanted application found\" and indicates it deleted the threats. \n I'm fairly confused, clearly that doesn't seem right. I re-enrolled the device a second time using the local script .cmd approach however I still don't see any devices listed in the M365 Defender/security admin portal. There is no indicator on the client that DFE MDE has been installed (does it need to be \"installed\" per se or just enrolled?)\n Obviously being able to launch and run commands in mimikatz was only possible because I disabled the real time protection and clicked past many warnings, but still something doesn't seem right there. Is DFE MDE just a centralized location for admins to manipulate built in Windows Defender settings?

I probably cannot just ask them, as the company is old-school and they'd prefer me just sitting idlely for an hour even though I have nothing to do.\n Our setup is as follows, Azure Active Directory, every machine is a Windows, all connected on the same internal network that you have to 2FA into your machine. All of the network is monitored and goes through a proxy. We also have laptop window machines that work on the same active directory account and if you want to access your work station inside the office from home, you have to use their VPN and then Remote Desktop into it. This all works great, and while I am not a Windows user myself, I am really pleased as to how nice the experience is, considering the heavy emphasis on safety.\n Now to my question, to what extent can my employer track me? My main questions are about the laptop, when it's not connected to their network/ VPN, is there anything inside the laptop/ windows that is tracking what I am doing? Do I have to cover my camera? I am mostly asking because after finishing my work for the day and I am at the office, I usually have an hour or so to kill before I can go home, and I would like to Remote Desktop/ SSH into my home machine and continue working on my own stuff, but I am not sure if these can be tracked and if I would alert someone like I am doing something shady. \n Basically I would like to access my own machine from the work laptop without causing problems for anyone. \n    submitted by    /u/West-Papaya  \n [link]   [comments]",

We explained him that the process is to issue devices that we have in stock first, unless there is a very good (e.g. medical) reason why a different device should be used. He didn't like that and went on and complained that this wouldn't be fair etc. Being in charge,I looked him in the eyes and asked what was wrong with the device, as it was in a technical fine condition and it had been cleaned well by my colleague before it was handed over; Of course he didn't have an answer, but still more or less demanded to get a new phone ordered. After telling him that we just stuck to a totally common process and that he would have to get those changed, he went away and hasn't been seen again that day (turned out he went to hr to ask for a change of the process and this eventually went all the way up). We are by far no huge company where something like this might be typical, but even if, just feeling this entitlement from sales all the time (I could fill pages with examples of them causing issues and collateral damage everywhere) in combination with such a pointless, unjustified, wasteful demand almost made me respond in a rather unprofessional way (my answers might have been emotional here and there,but professional).\n Is it just me or have some people just lost touch of what makes someone a successful worker?\n    submitted by    /u/klaasbob88  \n [link]   [comments]",

WMI for Windows, SNMP for Linux/appliances, and so on. but, it feels very, very stuck in the past. like, it's 2023 and they still do not support recurring maintenance window scheduling, or rules like \"only alert if the alarm threshold has been exceeded for X scan intervals\". maddening.\n the handful of other products i've tried -- PDQdeploy, ManageEngine Patch Manager, Automox, Level dot io -- do not (at the time i tested each one) support pre- or post-patch scripting, e.g., stop the specified service and wait for the process to terminate before beginning patching. naturally, i'm tired of doing it manually in BatchPatch but i just haven't found a solid replacement yet.\n i have about 140 Windows servers (98% VM's) that i need to deal with.\n please give me recommendations on products and/or process improvements that you've found to make this task easier. thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/No_Direction4544  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm still attending school as a computer science major and only have one semester left for this fall to graduate.

I'm thinking of taking the job, gaining the experience, and if I still feel like I'd rather do web development jump into that after a year of doing security.\n Would it be wise to just take the opportunity and see what happens? Or should I only accept the role if I feel I have a future in security? I don't want to screw the company or myself over for the future.

We bought a few Samsung 1643a SAS SSD drives that we would like to use to extend the life of these old servers a bit.\n When installing the drives, they were properly recognized, they show up in IDRAC. I set up a new Virtual Disk, configured the RAID array, did a fast initialization (as the drives were brand new), everything went smoothly.\n However, on reboot, it took a very long time for the server to start, and it stops at the PERC initialization with the message \"Adapter at Baseport is not responding. No adapter\" and fails to continue to boot.\n Removing the drives, the adapter is initialized and the machine boots.\n I also tried adding the drives while I was in the BIOS RAID utility, and it's the same, as via IDRAC. The drives get recognized, RAID array configuration works, but upon reboot, it stops with the same error message.\n Before the error message pops up, the drives' LEDs blink slowly, sequentially (one after the other). After a few minutes, they all blink fast. I let it be for a few hours, but did not change the results.\n Here are some other things I tried already:\n  \nfirmware/bios update - everything is up to date\n only connected 1/2/4/6 drives at a time\n removed other drives in the enclosure\n perform a full initialization of the raid array from the BIOS RAID utility\n opened up the server and checked the cables, battery, reseated the adapter\n used another identical server\n  \nAny idea of what might be wrong?\n Anyone else use this combo R720/H710P/1643a?\n Thanks a bunch!\n    submitted by    /u/Ditzah  \n [link]   [comments]",

Because it was a huge pain and I found no resources online, plus Lenovo’s premium tech support couldn’t help over the phone.\n Long story short: Borked Windows install on tower and wanted to run an official recovery install rather than a clean one. Recovery Creator was failing to create the installer USB drive.\n Steps initially taken:\n  \n Placed online digital order for recovery\n  Inserted a flash drive\n  Downloaded Lenovo USB Recovery Creator and ran it\n  Signed in and selected my digital order\n  Let it download the media\n  Allowed it to attempt to create the USB recovery key\n  \nAt this point it failed, with a number of errors mentioning that it could no longer find the flash drive and that it failed at partitioning the drive.\n Checked disk management and found it had created a RAW 32GB partition and left the rest of the space unallocated. Looked like it failed after that initial partitioning, right before formatting.\n What it took to get it to work:\n Disk management failed every time I tried to manually repartition or in any way ‘fix’ the USB drive.\n I had to use diskpart, select the disk, clean it, create partition primary. After this I was able to successfully modify the drive through disk management again.\n Some more testing and I discovered you basically have to manually create the 32GB FAT32 partition on a flash drive and most importantly, assign it a letter. Make sure to leave the rest of the drive space unallocated. Then use the recovery creator to actually write the media and create the recovery USB.\n Don’t manually create and format the partition? The recovery creator will try to do it itself and fail. Messing up your flash drive and requiring diskpart to fix.\n Don’t assign a drive letter after partitioning and formatting? Recovery creator will simply fail.\n Best of luck to anyone who may come across this in their time of need.\n    submitted by    /u/DanielThiberge  \n [link]   [comments]",

When did you become confident in your ability to write scripts as a sysadmin? I'm a CS major, husband, father, working full time.

They know someone was in their house because they were missing their sunglasses at home, and the glasses were on their work desk when they got to work. So the \"hacker\" also has keys to his house and our office, supposedly. They reloaded their personal laptop and then said that the BIOS is hacked because it created an X drive while reloading. His work computer is hacked because there are updates with all capital names, and some without, and that's not how Microsoft would push out updates. Email that takes longer then a few second to receive from their personal account to their work account is because they are being intercepted, edited, and then delivered.\n Once a week I get emails with walls of text and screen shots, wanting to know things like why does the All users folder look exactly like the Program Data folder?\n Currently, they are pulling up the dev console on any financial sites (They work in accounting) and saying that the java script does not look right.

The company uses Mac's which I am in the process of replacing and creating a domain. The users do not have unique logins at this time. The CFO wants another solution as he doesn't like OneDrive for file storage and neither do I. If we had a domain it would be easy to implement a file server with access permissions but since we don't have that yet I am looking for a solution. Does anyone have any recommendations on a good way to resolve this issue until the domain is in place? I know I could build a file server in Azure that everyone could access but then we have the security aspect of folders not being available. I thought about a storage device like Nasuni but again the folder permissions issue arises again. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/mjaneway43  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hopefully you guys may have some solutions, but i have a few critical sites that my firm manages, and we have a few different monitoring applications we use for our own server infrastructure and websites individually. The issue I am running into is if a site was to go down at 3am my time (EST not that it matters) but i am sleeping. I have push notifications on my iphone, and have them classified as Critical alerts, so it will even come through on DND mode. BUT i am asleep, so one notification sound doesnt wake me up. I need like an alarm going off that i must dismiss, or separate device to deal with this. \n I am hoping that there are others out there that might have a simple and good solution they have setup. I know there are enterprise level services that can do this type of thing, but I am a small business and that would most likely be too costly and unnecessary.

On top of that, it bricked their Office 365 install AND broke their MFA so we had to reactivate their 2FA on all of those devices just to get it working again.\n -I have found some registry changes online to remove the toggle for new Outlook, but I am not sure if this is the same thing as the Windows Mail app seems to be gone on these workstations as well. While we ALL know one thing - end users lie lol, we also know Microsoft likes to use us as their beta test guinea pigs sometimes..\n ​\n -How TF do we stop this? so far it has only been a few workstations, but since it is bricking their 365 AND their 2FA, this could turn into a management nightmare and bury our guys fast.

          "description": "As the title says. You can't fleece or finesse your way getting local, high-skilled techs to do your work for you, run your business, onboard clients and expect to streamline your work in a matter of a few years, while sitting back drinking, snorting powder, or whatever pipe dreams you have. It may work for a little while, but you will eventually end up with employees, and clients alike, who will devalue your business to its demise. \n Where I'm from there's a toxic culture of this at the moment. Just because you started your IT career in 08 doesn't quantify your business for 15 years in service with a solid client base, when you decided to break off in 2018 and \"be your own boss\".\n Now, this is mainly for prospective employees looking to get into the MSP realm, fresh out of college, first IT jobs. Be very, very careful when applying and accepting positions for MSP's. Do your research, look up the directors and consultants and their history. If you don't, you will burn your resume with short stints at these failed businesses, who fight over breadcrumb clients with their empty promises of a seamless silver service. \n Always ratio the business in terms of current techs to managed clients before accepting a position - at the moment a safe zone and job security is 1:50, and may even move more towards 1:75 1:100 as more businesses go cloud. Anything less and you are only going to fill a void for 6-12 months and end up in the endless cycle of last in first out, as business goes through peaks and troughs at certain times of the year. \n This is not speculation, it's a reality.\n    submitted by    /u/EvolvedChimp_  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have quite a lot of strict security guidelines for what we can and can't use. It's a time consuming process doing a task sequence in MECM, manually doing drivers and BIOS updates and configuring it for lots of different branding packs, languages etc. Windows updates take a long time to deploy and manage. We're almost entirely on prem but moving services to the cloud slowly.\n I'm looking at making it more flexible. Anything is on the table, cost aside.\n Management hear about autopilot and cloud and think it's great. Is it? Is it possible at this scale?\n The \"ideal\" world is: as many people on cloud as we can. Onboarding is streamlined, models / vendor are mostly agnostic. Open up a ton more options for device models etc. Drivers and things are managed much easier, allowed straight out to the internet and updated as needed.\n Again cost is not an issue.\n Only issues: require lots of compliancy. Lots of standard software, endpoint management etc. Lots of office based and remote workers.\n What are you guys doing? What would you like to do?

          "description": "Hey there! Just wanted to share a bit about my background. I joined my company as a network engineer about 3 months ago, bringing along my CCNP certification and previous experience in Cisco networking. Although I have some familiarity with basic Linux commands, my main expertise lies in the networking side of IT.\n Now, here's where things get interesting. The senior system administrator recently left the company, leaving me in charge of managing all the systems and servers. To be honest, I feel a bit overwhelmed and lacking in confidence. The senior guy still tries to help me out when he can, but he's got his own projects keeping him busy.\n The senior IT guy at our company has over 20 years of experience, and he's incredibly knowledgeable. He seems to have a natural understanding of all aspects of systems and developments. Technical stuff comes easily to him, so he never really felt the need to document everything. Before he left, he did his best to teach me, but I must admit it wasn't enough for me. I'm not placing any blame on him, though. In fact, I really liked working with him and learned a lot. I'm simply sharing my current situation and the challenges I'm facing in my role.\n Let me give you an idea of what I'm dealing with. I've got my hands full with various VMs, including a Perforce server, TrueNAS, Active Directory, PFSense firewall, NextCloud, and several customer server VMs. The thing is, I'm fairly new to VMware systems, Linux, NAS, and PFSense. It doesn't seem like the company is planning to hire a senior IT person anytime soon, so it looks like I'll be flying solo in the IT department for a while.\n I know I need to upskill and expand my knowledge, but any advice or tips you have for someone in my shoes would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/kus222  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I'm wondering how the pros would diagnose low level wireless issues? Specifically i'm talking about poor performance - dropouts, high latency, dropped packets etc) on a wireless network in an industrial environment.\n Are there specific hardware and software tools one would use to look at channel utilisations and that sort of thing?\n Any help is much appreciated.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/WilliamWinklePicker  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not really looking at jobs yet, just mainly brushing up on old subjects and equipment configs that i haven't done in awhile and a thought struck me. Now that we live in a post covid world, what is the outlook for Network engineers to be fully remote? At the beginning of 2021 i worked as a temp IT support tech for a few months for a local resort whose network support was located in a different state. Yes, the engineers would visit every now and again but mostly they would remote in whenever there was a problem or a need to. This resorts company had properties nation wide but their network support team was based in FL. I'm curious as to how common this type of arrangement is.

I just started a month ago at a new Fortune 100 company with a massive, stupidly complex network. \n I am so overwhelmed. Everything is behind jumpboxes (poorly documented) so it’s difficult to understand what to jump through in order to connect to anything, making manual network discovery difficult. \n I come from a Cisco shop, and everything is Juniper and Arista here. \n There are literally dozens of VRFs inside their internal MPLS core. They run EVPN and VXLAN, stuff I’ve never worked with before. There are dozens and dozens of firewalls. The team has started a new network segmentation project, and there is little to no documentation on what subnets belong to each segment, what ‘zones’ are in each segment, etc. \n I feel like I’m drowning. Normally I try to buckle down and start from the core and work my way outward, documenting physical and logical connections, but this place has literally hundreds of devices in the core. The routing is extremely complex with tons of BGP, MPLS, EVPN, VXLAN, VRFs everywhere, SDWAN.\n Just need some advice. Words of encouragement. SOMETHING.

I was thinking it would be beneficial to set up ISIS peering across the same link as the BGP as this is a point to point and will have a reduced cost allowing the traffic from the outside networks to route that way. Will I have an issue peering two isis neighbors both advertising the default route through default originate or will I need to filter it between hosts somehow?\n Edit: thinking about it I would think the local static default route will take precidence in the firewall and the default-originate route would never be installed unless we were to lose internet peering on one side.

Each connection may be a trickle of syslogs, or may be bursty during a security event, but still relatively low bandwidth requirements. However, once they all land at the one VPN concentrator there is quite a flow of those syslog messages on the wire. We are trying to send those to a log analyzer/SIEM in the cloud, and we are trying to overcome some bandwidth cost constraints there. Syslog is normally fire-and-forget, so if we have any bandwidth contention, it is possible for some of those messages to get lost.\n What do you recommend to overcome this possible data loss? More bandwidth is the easy option, but even then how do you scale for an event that bursts above even that? I'm thinking some sort of relay that stores and forwards, but forwards across the lower bandwidth link with a reliable method (RELP or the like?) to remove or significantly lessen the likelihood of data loss.\n Or am I looking at this all wrong?\n    submitted by    /u/Rednarb  \n [link]   [comments]",

A solution would be to use 4G routers at both ends and use VPN tunnelling to create a link. I think I will be able to use VLC streaming to gain access to the sensor screen from the base station laptop (I have seen someone make this work). However, I am not sure on the exact configurations and settings required Networking/LAN is really something i have no idea about I'm an electrical/aerospace engineer, so this is alien to me.\n Could I for example connect the sensor to a 4g router (TP link Wireless AC750) with an RJ45 cable and have a usb 4G modem connected (prepaid/postpaid 4G). Have the same setup on the base station with the laptop and using a VPN gain connection between them? I think this is called site to site IPsec VPN correct me if I'm wrong, it's quite confusing for me I have even heard the term DMZ host and not sure which to use. Or alternatively would a ubiquity Bullet AC work this uses their AirMax Protocol (based on TDMA) WiFi whihc has great range with the right antenna.\n Also, as a side topic, if the above were correct, can I connect 2 devices (sonar, onboard pc) to the same router onboard so that they share the same network. Is it possible to use that network to get the sonar screen live and at the same time use something like tightVNC to gain access to the onboard pc remotely from the base station? if they are all on the same network/LAN it should be possible they would just have different IP addresses?\n Thanks for the replies in advance I really appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/Due_Theme_3191  \n [link]   [comments]",

These consist of two clusters, one located at each site. The BGP configuration is functioning correctly without any issues.\n However, when these routes are redistributed into OSPF (Cisco), problems arise. Everything operates as expected until we start conducting failover tests. We sequentially disconnect ISP routers 1 through 3 in an attempt to force traffic through each router along the path. When we reach router 4, everything still continues to function properly.\n The issue emerges when router 1 is reconnected. As soon as this happens, it immediately expects, via BGP, that the traffic will be routed through it. However, the OSPF routing table has not been updated at this point and is still pointing towards router 4. This creates a black hole, as the routes are expected to come from router 4 via OSPF, but from the perspective of BGP, router 1 is now online.\n The underlying problem is that router 4 never lost its link state since it still owns the routes (OSPF).\n I hope I have managed to clearly explain this complex scenario. If anyone can shed light on how to resolve this issue, please do reach out. If there is something incorrect with my configuration, I am open to suggestions.

All traffic goes to cloud servers anyway (let’s ignore services like AirDrop for now).\n When designing a primitive wifi network (PoE switch and # wireless APs) solely for smartphones and tablets (no IoT, let’s say a guest wifi in a hotel or library), how does it improve security (overall and for individual devices) to firewall (packet filter or hardware) compared to just directly connecting the network to the internet (fiber uplink, just setting a default route to the switch’s SFP+ WAN interface)?\n Client isolation (everybody can just access WAN, not nearby clients) can be a security improvement (hotel wifi) or disadvantage (school wifi), but how about incoming connections?\n Because when the mobile devices leave the wifi, they anyway could be vulnerable via cellular (some mobile ISPs deploy public addresses also on IPv4, smartphone is directly reachable=vulnerable from the world). The wifi basically is just to bypass the expensive cellular interface and bridge the devices via cheap wifi in this scenario.\n  \nIs it necessary to consider VLANs if clients are isolated and only access the WAN/cloud? Eg. one ESSID+VLAN for staff and guests on their own ESSID+VLAN? Does it really have security improvements?\n  \nAny ideas or best practices for such a wifi scenario?\n    submitted by    /u/SFP-ONU  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got some networking changes coming down the pipe and I need to move this connection on the N3024f side to a couple of the SFP 1G ports (Gi1/0/1-24). The SFP+ DAC cables I've been using won't work (in theory, and in practice, I tried them..) between SFP and SFP+ ports.\n What's the right DAC cable (or right kind of cable)? Due to the switches being a bit on the old side (I know..) I'm getting a fair amount of conflicting information about whether it's possible at all or what DAC cables might work? It seems like some people have backwards compatibility luck connecting SFP and SFP+ ports with DAC cables (provided the SFP+ side is locked 1G speed), but its not clear how much of this is the cable or what type of cable or whether it's some kind of vendor specific thing.\n I could always just use a couple of the N2048p copper ports to the N3024f RJ combo ports and be done with it, but the N2048p side is pretty full and I'd like to not lose usable access ports in the process. Another alternative option is using optics between the switches or 1G RJ45 ports on the N2048p side to the combo ports on the 3024f side.\n But DAC cables would overall be a better setup -- less parts, etc, but its not clear it will work or the cables for it to work even exist.\n    submitted by    /u/OperationMobocracy  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is my understanding that stacked switches will flood all their multicast traffic between all stack members as they're logically one switch which is a drawback. \n However, my question is - will links between stack members automatically loadbalance traffic (so 3 x 10gig fibers becomes 30gig link) - or do you need to setup the stack and then put your stack links into a LAGG effectively meaning you have the same limitations of a LAGG when doing a stack i.e. same limit of number of switchports that can participate in the LAGG.\n If they loadbalance automatically, is the load balancing performed via a different method that would make one method more efficient at loadbalancing i.e. layer 2 or layer 3 hashing?\n I'm aware this will vary depending on the chip used in the switch but any info regardless of switch brand & model would be useful, particularly Netgear m4300 range.\n ​\n One additional bonus question whilst I'm at it - is there any difference in the efficiency of loadbalancing when comparing a static LAGG vs dynamic (LACP)? \n ​\n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/shivellebits  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ideally I would like to just use a command line or something simple but thinking of using the wands, however when researching which one to get I saw that some people were having issues using them on managed switches so before I go wasting money thought best to ask the experts.\n For context, I work in a building that has multiple groups all using the same infrastructure and the IT guy for my group with full permission to be in the room, however there are others who also do the IT for their group with same permissions.

Dark fiber is being terminated on these switches in both sites.\n The routing is simple with a /30 mask being used and no ip switchport being configured on each dark fiber port on each switch. EIGRP is being used for routing.\n We use Solarwinds to monitor these devices.\n Now the problem is we are suddenly seeing issues on this dark fiber link starting today, was working fine until yesterday (last week there was a fiber cut which caused interruptions but has been working fine until yesterday since the fix). The port keeps flapping randomly every 30 minutes or so. Will go down for a few minutes say like 3 or 10 minutes at a time and will come back up.\n We opened a ticket with Comcast (dark fiber is from Comcast) and they sent someone to check the their equipment. He came checked within 15 minutes and determined it wasn't an issue on their end then got an email from them saying that it could be an issue with sfps/bad jumpers.\n Now upon checking on solarwinds I see a bunch of receive errors today not necessarily coinciding with the flapping but I do see them. It's about 10-18k received errors (only receive) on one of the switches (haven't put the other 3850 switch into monitoring yet) and this was today. Until yesterday the received errors were just 198-200 or so.\n So could this be an sfp issue on this particular port? Could swapping out this 10Gig sfp fix the issue?

We've disable IDS, bounced the server/firewall/modem etc, and still get the message in the screenshot.

Is there a way to bypass this limitation using router? \n My idea is that multiple iPads connect to router via wifi (wlan). \n Router acts as a bridge (between wlan and eth) and routes traffic trough eth to mixing console.

So each server must have the same version of the back-end.\n - We need to extract some data's from each server to make them anonymous and build worldwide stats, which needs to be accessible for any user.\n For the first point, I was thinking of simply open new VPS on a given country, and just deploy the last stable version of the backend, and link all of them across our DNS. But i'm not sure if it's a good practice to have only 1 DNS server for people who want's to access a server far from the DNS ? Don't really know how does it works actually.\n For the 2nd point, i was thinking about a kind of proxy server, that put itself between the country server and the client, that will collect the anonymous data and store it in a separate database, and then duplicate and sync this server in the cloud to make it available all around the world ?\n ​\n My issues concern the stack i should use to make this kind of setup. My knowledge stop to NGINX, Docker & Node.js to be quick, and that seems to involve more complicated stuff, so if you can point me to some docs and/or softwares that would works for my purpose ?\n ​\n Thanks guys\n    submitted by    /u/Chichaaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have several wireless captures taken with my Aircheck G3 that gives me access to capture all of the frames being sent on a channel, including management and control frames.\n I am intending to determine the amount of airtime that beacons are consuming. From the captures, I already know that about 40% of the frames captured are beacons, but I want to determine how much actual airtime this corresponds to.\n I know beacons are transmitted at the slowest mandatory data rate, and I know the frame size. But I don't think the airtime calculation is as simple as the frame size divided by the data rate (with the appropriate unit conversions between bytes and Mbps, of course), because I know the bits can be packed into higher MCS indexes / QAM encodings. (Or, am I thinking about this backwards, whereas a 24 Mbps data rate is the what you get at a fixed MCS / QAM?)\n So, in summary - with access to the PHY and MAC layers from an 802.11 capture, can I calculate airtime consumed for each frame? Or is there not enough info in a frame?\n This is in an 802.11ax network, btw, and I know it can get even more tricky with OFDMA's resource unit allocations, which I don't see any evidence of in the frame dumps. \n    submitted by    /u/wifi_engineer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Multiple (tens) of branch offices.\n Solution option 1 is FortiGate on each branch office, and also on HQ. They can then connect them with tunnels and whatnot as use-cases appear. It's a desentralized solution which I do like. Nothing needing user-licensing is also just nice. Possibilites are quite grand.\n Solution option 2 is Cisco Secure Access SASE with Meraki gear. It's a centralized solution, which means all branch traffic is piped through there. I read there's some 250 Mbps limits pr connection, which scares me, and it's a lot \"younger\" solution (but does that mean it's still immature?). Licensing is ofc worse, being Cisco. It does however bring a very centralized management as it's all centralized.\n Does anybody have good (or bad) experience with this Cisco, Meraki, Umbrella mash-up? Would love to hear your 2 cents. I'm very familiar with Forti, no experience on Meraki.\n The use-case is first and foremost internet connectivity, then adding on some security (web filter etc), and then possibly adding some centralized service from HQ (interconnecting to a partner or publishing a private app or server for instance).\n    submitted by    /u/Roy-Lisbeth  \n [link]   [comments]",

Until the timeout is reached and its prepared for a rekey.\n Now with it being an IKEv2 tunnel PFS is only enabled upon the first re-key of the tunnel. Once this rekey happens, TCP traffic seems to stop working. Ping/Traceroute all seem to work fine. \n I don't understand why PFS is adding that much overhead to the Packet. As if I set the DF bit to clear, the packets are fragmented and TCP connections work fine again. So this is leading me to some kind of MTU/MSS issue.\n I tested a ping from R1-->R2 (without fragmentation) and the most I can get through before PFS is enabled is 1280 bytes, after PFS is enabled the max I can go is 1150 (alot of overhead being added to the pack which is strange). Which is an extremely small size (in my opinion) to set the max TCP-mss to.\n Now im waiting for someone to give me a PCAP of the trouble router to find the optimal MSS/MTU size, hopefully the issue will be more present there. \n I have a few sites working just fine with just ISAKMP/GRE/IPSEC setup. \n Sorry I have been troubleshooting this for some time now.

I currently have my CCNA, A+, Security + although it has been over a year since the exam.\n To give a little bit about the job posting without revealing too much. They are asking for on preferred qualifications, (experience in that niche field) which I have. CCNA which I have.\n Here is some of the technical listed.\n experience managing data networks with Cisco routers and switches\n experience configuring Cisco network equipment\n Palo Alto firewalls, F5 load balancing, Cisco 9000 series, and Cisco Nexus Platform\n I have been studying all week and brushing up on my CCNA material. But I wanted to come to my fellow reddit goers for any shared network engineer interview experiences that may guide me.\n If I am in the wrong place, Please let me know and I will promptly remove.\n God speed gentlemen.\n ​\n ​\n Edit: ** Wow! I was not expecting all the comments and support. \n Thanks a lot guys! \n This certainly has helped me feel better about the interview and the process moving forward.

I'm in charge of administering two Cisco routers, each equipped with 2 WAN ports and 4 LAN ports. One of the routers serves as the main router in an MPLS network, connected to the corporate network. The backup router connects the corporate network via DMVPN.\n Currently, the LAN is directly connected to both WAN routers, ensuring redundancy through HSRP and IP SLAs. However, we now want to introduce a firewall cluster between the LAN and the WAN, so that the LAN side is protected by the firewalls and the default gateways for the LAN networks reside on the firewall. To achieve this, we plan to establish a transit network between the Cisco routers and the firewall cluster.\n The customer's network are isolated from other customers using VRFs. We are currently utilizing MPBGP with iBGP for the LAN customer networks and OSPF for overlay purposes.\n Here's what we have implemented in the past so far: redundancy through OSPF with corresponding costs and a distribute list to only learn specific networks.\n I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or insights on how to achieve redundancy for the firewall cluster in the most straightforward manner. Are there any other methods or best practices you could recommend?\n Thanks in advance for your help! \n Edit: https://imgur.com/a/uMNFc5e - for visualization\n    submitted by    /u/errore_maximus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n I am aware that this may be a controversial topic that has been discussed before, but some of the existing threads include arguments probably not of relevance any more (e.g., power consumption of first generation NICs) or do not apply in my specific scenario (e.g., no plans to change to 10Gbit/s switching). So here goes:\n We have a NAS (Synology DS1821+) which is used for central data storage via 1Gbit/s LAN to a multitude of users - there is no intent to change this. However, one of our servers needs access to a lot of data being stored on this server, which is why we thought to upgrade to 10Gbit for this single connection (going up to 25Gbit does not seem warranted since we use SATA drives in the NAS). The distance between server and NAS are just a few meters, so we would not need the benefits fiber provides in this area. Costs should be kept as low as reasonable.\n - Would you suggest copper or fiber in this context? \n - We initially planned to use Mellanox ConnectX-4 on the server, but even off-brand copper SFP+ modules are way more expensive than I thought - on the contrary, the fiber version of synology's NICs are more expensive :D\n - We could also purchase a 10Gbit NIC for the server with RJ45: Do you recommend an Intel version? I have heard that Intel is leaving the networking market (but that may have been just for switches), so I am a little worried about long-term support. There are also versions of Intel NICs from different manufacturers (HP, DELL, etc.)...are these 100% compatible in any server (running Windows Server 2022) or just in servers of that manufacturer?\n Just let me know what you think :).\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/peter_cass  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have 7 years overall experience and the certs to go for it (CCNA, CCNP + some Juniper ones too). \n I'm curious how the B2B market for network engineers looks in the EU looks for you guys.

On the other hand, even though I have the \"open to work\" tag on LinkedIn, I have one or two recruiters reaching out to me. Back during the Covid days, I got between 3-5 offers per week and I didn't even have the \"open to work\" tag. Even if I apply to positions (EU wide, looking for a digital nomad lifestyle), only 1-in-10 even comeback with an offer and their meaning of hybrid is relocation to their country. \n What are your thoughts on this ?

          "description": "Hi,\n I am after some guidance/advise on implementing OSPF for one of our customers and I'm getting a little confused with the design implementation options. To give some background, we have a customer which has 1 main site and 4 branch sites (5 sites total). Each of those sites has their own VLANs that site on their core switches, and then there is a static default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the firewall. On each firewall there is a VPN to the central site for accessing services etc. The drawback to this implementation is that there is no 'inter-site' routing at the minute and to access another site you need to go out from the central site. \n With this in mind, I'm looking to implement OSPF but just not sure on how to design this, would all 5 sites sit in area 0, or would the main site be area 0 and the other 4 sites be their own respective areas? As I say, each site has their own core switches which the VLAN interfaces reside on so there are technically 2 x L3 devices (core switches and firewalls) at each site. I plan to use IPsec VPNs for the interconnectivity and utilise VTIs on the tunnel ends. I've tried to read up on this and view example topologies and although I understand the fundamentals of OSPF, I seem to be missing the very basics of a real world deployment!\n Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/YqPKoad6eNB6  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some of my co workers are convinced that newer model media converters we are using are storing mac addresses like a switch would. Reason for this assumption is we have noticed that if we unplug the device on the media converter and then plug in a second device, the second device will not authenticate, because the switch is still seeing the first mac. The fix for this seems to be power cycling the media converter. Shutting and no shutting the switch interface does not seem to fix it, only power cycling the media converter.\n We actually had a device that was connected and failing mab authentication, but even when the device was removed, we still saw logs populating on the switch saying the device was failing. Personally, I was thinking this could be something with DHCP snooping still holding the mac in the database, or maybe some kind of AAA thing. But I really dont see how a media converter could be holding a mac, unless im wrong. \n Does this make any sense at all? I was always under the assumption that all media converters are layer 1 devices, and they in no way store any information at all.\n    submitted by    /u/GC_Player  \n [link]   [comments]",

As this is mostly covering open standards I am hoping that this is the more appropriate place to ask these questions.\n I am struggling to find answers from Google and have reached out to another network engineer who isn't sure either.\n Once I have configured a secure ISAKMP connection between devices, I am aware that the device then negotiates an appropriate IPsec policy to follow. However going through the system help and exploring available commands, I have noticed that you can define an IPsec transform set without specifying most of the IPsec framework.\n As an example, I have made an IPsec transform set with the following command.\n  \ncrypto ipsec transform-set TEST-TUNNEL esp-3des\n  \nThe only things that have been defined from the IPsec framework from this command is the protocol type (esp) and the confidentiality (3des). I have not defined integrity, authenticity or the diffie-hellman group. Yet the iOS has accepted my command regardless and has created the transform set.\n How does the system make up for half the framework being unconfigured? Does it take it from the existing ISAKMP policy? A system default policy? Just create a tunnel without any of those policies applied or would it be unsuccessful?\n In addition i've seen the command comp-lzs as an option, though iOS does not allow me to create a map exclusively with this alone. From Googling I have seen that it has something to do with compression and should not be used alongside voice or video, though are there any good resources that can explain the lzs algorithm and its application in laymans terms?\n    submitted by    /u/RegularCeg  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the far end of the building is our network closet and throughout the buildings UAPs were installed (2 per building). The two in bldg C went out and I have to trace the cables but I can't figure out where they go and all of the connections on the 8-port switch show the link lights are active (I don't have any network tools yet). I also ran nslookup on the network and it was able to find the IP addresses and names of all the UAPs, so I was at least able to obtain that information for the two UAPs that are down.\n Whoever installed the network left no documentation and the person I replaced passed away. I don't have the login for the Unifi gateway, the router, no cables are labeled, nothing is organized. Anyway, I think the UAPs might run to another switch before going to the switch in the network closet but no one knows where that is located or if that's even how it was done. My other thought is that I think the UAP cables might be punched down on the patch panel.\n Is it normal or common practice to run cables between 200 to 500 ft directly from the UAPs and punch them down on the patch panel as opposed to using network drops?

That should leave the subinterface traffic unaltered and on VLAN 220, but will add VLAN 200 to the traffic on the parent interface only, correct?\n Put most simply, the switch will pass the physical/parent traffic to the firewall with VLAN 200, but it won't modify the VLAN 220 tagged traffic from the subinterface because that traffic is already tagged.

We are just taking default routes from our upstreams and we have two upstream providers (one 100G and one 40G). Traffic flows out one and back in over both. It works but we are looking to take full BGP tables from both and possible a third.\n We don't really use any advanced router features, just the typical BGP, OSPF, a few static routes, and route maps. We are struggling to find a solution that offers the port speeds we use, can handle the BGP tables, and is cost effective.\n We are primarily a Cisco shop, mostly using secondhand gear. I realize our needs may push us to purchasing something new and that's fine if it is the case.\n I stumbled across the Cisco NCS line and it looks like it might be up our alley. I was mostly interested in something like the 5504 or 5508 so we could grow it as we grow. The licensing has me tripped up a little bit though. I see them secondhand but I'm not so sure I can just buy one and it would work. I guess my main question is do these things require ongoing licensing and if so can I buy one used and purchase a license for it? Or do I need to go through a reseller and purchase one new.\n I'm also open to alternative solutions. Our current Edge router is using 2 100G ports and 4 40G ports. We have quite a few 10G ports on it as well. I've been looking at Juniper's stuff and also considered looking at a whitebox solution such as Edge-Core. If we go with something else I prefer something as close to Cisco CLI as possible. Money is always an issue... we have it but I have to beg to get it.

          "description": "I currently work for a company that uses Orion for our network monitoring platform. As a directive from about, we're now looking at another SaaS type network monitoring solution. The solution seems to be far from mainstream (not going to mention by name, but HPE just bought them). There seems to be little information about anybody experience using it, but someone one of our VPs used to work with use it, and so it comes recommended and seems to be what we're going to be using soon. \n We are a very heavy Grafana shop. The vast majority of our application stack and business process flow monitored with Grafana. It's seemingly the Go To solution for most of our monitoring....except for infrastructure (network/servers). \n The primary driver to the proposed migration is cost. New vendor says they can save us tons, and we can eliminate Orion and PagerDuty. I'm questioning since we are so heavily using Grafana why we aren't at least considering it for infrastructure, I suggested we at least explore a small POC to see how it would work for what we need. \n Is there anyone out there using Grafana for their infrastructure monitoring? Horror or success stories? I'm starting to do a bit of research to see if this is a good use case, I see some articles on the topic, but not much from the aspect of 'it's what we use, here's how it works for us'.\n    submitted by    /u/RouterMonkey  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Aruba switch supports sFlow but we don't want to just sample packets, we want to log every connection--source and destination, ports, time and number of packets / amount of data transferred. We don't need to keep and store all the data that was transferred, just the connection/header info mentioned above.\n Does anyone know of a good (maybe open-source/free) platform that could provide similar analysis/logging as compared to NetFlow, but based only on gathering mirrored network traffic? We aren't looking for something inline, just need to be able to go back in time and see what traffic flows are associated with a particular IP/host. For reference, we are currently exporting NetFlow data to SolarWinds which provides a webGUI for analysis of the exported data.

So two different circuits and they handle the IP failover.\n The two CISCOs are directly connected to each other.\n I have this connected into 2 x HP 2530 Switches on a dedicated VLAN for the WAN connection.\n So CISCO1 ETH0 goes to Switch 1 port 48 and CISCO2 ETH0 goes to Switch 2 port 48\n There is a fibre connection between the two HP switches just carrying the VLAN for the WAN connections. This is done via a HP LACP trunk and STP.\n Each of the HP Switches then has a connection to two internal fibre switches on an LACP Trunk carrying just the Management VLAN only. To allow access for managing the switches etc.\n We then have a port configured on each switch to uplink to our Watchguard HA Firewalls for WAN VLAN\n Basically the issue is when the two ISP WAN connections are connected to the required HP switch port 48 our end it creates a loop and kills the network. If I leave loop protect enabled it will block the port, then unblock, then block and cause issues.\n So essentially it's blocking the link to one of the ISP routers ports that's dedicated for the WAN uplink.\n I have tried putting the WAN ports on a HP Trunk as untagged and still it kills the network ports and then connectivity.\n ​\n I'm running out of ideas currently.

They want to do an ad-hoc network that will support up to 300 wireless clients at a time. The use case is simply to provide public wifi to check emails, browse, social media, etc. The AP/switching/routing portion is pretty easily accomplished. We plan on implementing client isolation, of course, and bandwidth limiting each client to about 2 Mbps. So total throughput really would only need to be 600Mbps if all devices were running full tilt.\n They want to use cellular to connect to WAN, and so my first thought was Cradlepoint. Specifically looking at this one https://cradlepoint.com/product/endpoints/w1850-series/ .

          "description": "Hello! I know, I know... Unifi, bleh... But still, does anyone know how Unifi's IP conflict detection works under the hood?\n ​\n The scenarios are that Unifi switches and access points are being used. In no case is a Unifi gateway being used and so some other DHCP server is being used, either firewall of a different vendor or Windows Server.\n ​\n The reason I ask is because, while the feature of IP conflict detection is certainly useful and certainly sometimes correct, it also seems to be sometimes erroneous. \n ​\n For example, sometimes there will be an alert for an IP conflict, and thorough checking is done and through manual checking there does not appear to be an actual conflict. \n ​\n In another example, sometimes it will alert that there is an IP conflict on X subnet, but not specify which IP it detected in conflict. In what scenario would a Unifi switch or AP be able to detect \"a\" conflict but not a specific IP that is in conflict? \n ​\n Anyway, I could guess what mechanisms and logic are being used for IP conflict detection, but it would be helpful to know actual fact as to what's triggering the alerts, to help identify if it is an erroneous detection or to help track down the offending device(s). In many cases the networks are far away and being managed remotely, so just going onsite and tracking things down physically is not always an option.\n ​\n I've searched online but was not able to find much of any information at all about the internal workings of this feature.

We have MX68CWs (spokes) at each branch and an MX105 (hub) at our HQ with site-to-site VPN setup. \n Our networking partner is telling us that Cisco AnyConnect cannot be used with these appliances and that we must use native VPN clients built into Windows and other supported operating systems. Yet, this documentation states that all these models are supported for use with AnyConnect. Note that we also use Duo Security and SAML for MFA-protected SSO logon to AnyConnect. \n Is our networking partner correct?\n EDIT: Thanks so much to everyone for your detailed responses. I appreciate the help. I will now push back on my networking partner.\n    submitted by    /u/Enjoyer6558  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems all vfis and x-connects peers are up but I'm not seeing the upes exchanging their mac's or mac's in the bridge-domain of the NPEs.

          "description": "I was looking at a redesign of the network where I work. I work in the Energy sector and we have multiple methods of communication across a large regional area of states in the USA. We currently have a mixture of BGP and OSPF routing protocols with route redist at several places in the network. The more the network grows and the more \"routing rules\" we put in place, the more I think that just going BGP full stack all through the network is a good idea. The issue I have with going forward is that not EVERYBODY on the network staff is fully proficient in BGP routing, and its easy to just slap OSPF on interfaces for them. My issue is that if prefix lists for redistribution are not followed and updated properly, then it still causes issues routing from BGP to OSPF or vice versa anyway. We might as well just BGP it all and attach route preferences using BGP attributes such as weight, path prepending and local preference. \n ​\n I also think I could make things a bit easier to roll traffic using community values that would be propagated through the entire BGP environment, and use some of those values for path selections and ease of rolling traffic when I get it all scripted for those who may not be as proficient with BGP. My thought was that it would be easier for those folks just to maybe change a community value in one edge router to roll internet traffic, and have all other routers in the environment follow the rules attached to that community value. Hopefully that makes sense. I don't want to over complicate things, but honestly, things are getting more complicated just in the redistribution of routes that are happening today anyhow. It just keeps getting worse the more we grow.\n ​\n Thanks,\n B\n    submitted by    /u/bardsleyb  \n [link]   [comments]",

For now they'll get seperate SSIDs, but eventually we'll be moving it to a RADIUS assigned VLAN setup. \n So currently I am looking into another Ubiquiti unifi setup since it has served me well personally, and I do like the centralized management interface. But I want to make sure I am making the best choice here. Preferably I like to keep the single pane of glass interface for switches and wifi, but it's not required. I do need switches which do POE+ and can aggregate to a central 10g switch for distribution since we have a high bandwidth backup server. \n What kind of setup would you guys go with? Any recommendations?\n    submitted by    /u/WarriorXK  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’ve posted about this before, but I’m back with more answers but still no resolution. Long story short, Apple devices spoof their MAC by default. Each time the client roams from one WAP to the next (even under the same SSID) the mac address changes. In theory, this sounds great! \n Here’s my problem, each time the MAC address changes a new DHCP request is sent. At smaller facilities this typically doesn’t cause much issue. However, at our larger facilities this is causing our DHCP pool to run out of IPs. \n In an attempt to free up IP space, I’ve turned the DHCP lease time down to 1 minute and increased that network to a /22. On average, this network has around 150 users, at its busiest around 200. My attempt to relieve the issue worked for about 2 hours, then the DHCP pool was full again. \n Think about it this way, if 1 person walks across the facility and passes 10 WAPs with their phone in their pocket, they’ve just leased 10 different IPs. Now imagine 150 people constantly running around a hospital. \n I’ve been racking my brain over this for months, and without implementing an MDM I don’t think there’s much we can do. Thoughts?

          "description": "For some years we've been using a well-known web filtering provider, but are considering alternatives due to poor support, design decisions they've made with their latest platform and decreasing product quality in the platform we're using.\n Currently we use an endpoint-based filtering solution where traffic is either:\n  \nSteered to a proxy server running on the endpoint itself (via PAC file)\n Transparently intercepted by a Windows Filtering Platform driver\n  \nThe endpoint makes policy decisions and the traffic is sent to its destination directly. Our requirements (at a very high level) have been to:\n  \nBlock inappropriate categories\n Block security risks based on category\n Provide real-time assessment for potential security risks (e.g. compromised sites hosting phishing pages)\n  \nWe've spoken vendors with varying offerings:\n  \nBaracuda\n Censornet\n Cloudflare\n Menlo\n Netskope\n Skyhigh\n ZScaler\n  \nThe majority of these vendors take a different approach, where traffic is routed through a transparent proxy via ipsec/gre tunnel. I'm a little wary of this approach from a performance perspective. I understand the various vendors arguments in terms of better peering etc, but wary of further complexity in troubleshooting performance issues for our service desk team (which we don't really have with the incumbent).\n We have a decent remote-access VPN solution and no immediate desire to do anything with it.\n Does anyone have any vendors they can recommend that offer endpoint-based solutions, or vendors to avoid if we do go down the tunnel route?

Unfortunately some of the sites I visit don’t have a spare network port in the office for me to connect to. \n My current solution is to carry a 5-port Ethernet switch, and jump-in between one of the existing computers - connecting the switch to the wall outlet, and the existing computer and my laptop to the switch. It works well. However, a 5-port switch is bulky, it also has a wall-wart, which I need to plug in, many sites don’t have a spare power port either, so I carry a power-board which I put between the existing power and one of their devices… yes everything works, but it is a lot of equipment to carry around, and since I will usually only be at the site for a day, it is a pain unpacking and packing up etc.\n If there was a USB-powered switch it would reduce the need to carry a wall-wart and power board (my laptop easily lasts the day on battery, so power for it isn’t a concern), or even better, a USB Ethernet adapter with integrated switch, since I need to carry a USB Ethernet adapter anyway. Then I could just piggy-back in between an existing computer and the wall outlet.\n Anyone know of such a beast? I have googled, and not found anything, but maybe my search terms are wrong.\n Edit. Since many are saying to refer to Corp IT, our corporate IT are aware of the situation, and their recommended solution is “go to a computer store and buy a cheap switch”. They are happy for us to do it, because it is cheaper for the few mobile staff to do that, than for them to get extra outlets wired in at each site that has hit capacity. This is about getting a switch that is smaller and more portable than the typical budget 5 port switch.\n    submitted by    /u/AequidensRivulatus  \n [link]   [comments]",

Initially, I used EVPN ESI LAG with virtual gateway address but also have a lab using VRRP instead. I have found a major roadblock in deploying IPv6 in these environments: there is no state redundancy for DHCPv6-PD. The routers I am using serve as DHCPv6 relays and my CPE uses DHCPv6-PD to request prefixes. The relays snoop the DHCPv6 process and dynamically build routing information to the requestor CPE’s WAN address for the delegated prefix. However, this state is only ever built on one edge router or the other, meaning if one of the routers fails, all routing state for the prefixes delegated via DHCPv6-PD is lost. Even though I have a redundant PE, the redundancy is useless.\n This blew my mind that there was no mechanism for hot-standby of the DHCPv6 relay state. I found an article that Huawei switches apparently have such a mechanism, but looks proprietary.\n I found an ipSpace blog post from over 10 years ago on this topic: https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/03/do-we-need-dhcpv6-relay-redundancy.html\n Anyone found a solution to this problem?\n    submitted by    /u/farmer_kiwi  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, managing these devices can be challenging, as they are often used by multiple people and may be exposed to a variety of security risks.\n Problem that businesses face:\n The following are some of the problems that businesses face when managing shared Android devices:\n  \nSecurity: Shared Android devices are at risk of being lost, stolen, or tampered with. This can lead to the unauthorized access of corporate data or the installation of malware.\n Compliance: Businesses must comply with a variety of regulations, such as data protection laws and industry standards. Managing shared Android devices can be difficult to do in a way that meets all of these compliance requirements.\n Cost: Managing shared Android devices can be expensive, as businesses need to purchase and maintain the devices, as well as the software and services needed to manage them.\n  \nSolution to their problem:\n There are a number of solutions that businesses can use to manage shared Android devices. These solutions include:\n  \nMobile device management (MDM) software: MDM software can be used to remotely manage shared Android devices. This includes features such as remote wipe, password policies, and app management..\n Containerization: Containerization is a technique that can be used to isolate corporate data from personal data on shared Android devices. This helps to protect corporate data from unauthorized access.\n Bring your own device (BYOD): BYOD allows employees to use their own personal devices for work. This can help to reduce the cost of managing shared Android devices.\n  \nLearn more about Managing Shared Android Devices here!\n    submitted by    /u/ResponsibleHardship  \n [link]   [comments]",

Will I be able to call someone and they can help me if I get stuck in a lab? I doubt it. Maybe it means they support in the setting up of the VM and installing the software?\n Higher Education:\n - I work at a university. Would this mean I can use this type of CML?

There is an Ubuntu in each public subnet with an WG setup, which connects the two VPCs.\n Goal: My goal is to be able to connect to a machine in the private subnet of one of the VPCs from a machine in the private subnet of the other VPC over the WG connection, without setting up additional WG instances on the machines in the privates subnets. \n Detailed Setup:\n 1. VPC_cloud:\n - CIDR: 172.16.0.0/21 - public_subnet CIDR: 172.16.0.0/24 - private_subnet CIDR: 172.16.1.0/24 - WG ip address: 192.168.0.1/24\n  \nVPC_edge:\n CIDR: 10.0.0.0/24\n public_subnet CIDR: 10.0.0.0/26\n private_subnet CIDR: 10.0.0.64/26\n WG ip address: 192.168.0.2/24\n  \nIn my current setup I am able to ping 192.168.0.1 from the WG Machine in VPC_edge and vice versa. I'm also able to ping the none WG ip of the WG machine in VPC_cloud from the WG machine in VPC_edge and vice versa. Like:ubuntu@10.0.0.10 ping 172.16.0.4 (and vice versa) works. But any other instance (except for the WG instance itself) on the same VPC can't be reached. IP forwarding is also enabled on both machines, BTW.\n As I understand the problem is with my routing, since WG setup works as expected, but I'm not sure what do do. Any help/advise is appreciated. Thanks! BTW, this is no homelab. It's a PoC that will be used in production. I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask.\n    submitted by    /u/alzgh  \n [link]   [comments]",

I remember and see in older documentation there was a management subnet to configure as well but I don't see that currently when configuring one.\n So my question is.... given the context that I just want to get a basic Palo up and running and reach it via mgmt.... not even worried about the nat stuff or data plane route tables and whatnot in azure yet..... what is the easiest method to do this?

We're ruling that out due to signal strength being poor in the location at the best of times, and once you add in a significant audience, we wouldn't want to rely on it.\n They're approx. 50m from a nearby building, so we're probably within spec to just run a long piece of Cat6A through the window from an existing data point, but this cable will need to share containment with mains power (240V/50Hz), and so I think there may be both technical and regulatory issues with this? I don't want this to fail an electrical inspection just before the event and lead us to have to frantically replan.\n My two main thoughts are fibre from an existing switch in a ground floor room, or P2P Wireless, with a preference for fibre (for cost reasons as we'll always re-use SFP modules and switches, but P2P kit is less likely to find any future use for us.)\n Has anyone done anything similar?\n If fibre is the answer, what level of armouring/ruggedising is necessary?

Currently i have the task to take a json file from the interweb, extract a certain portion of ip addresses and get them into one of Barracuda's 4 CustomExternalObjects.\n Technicalities:\n  \nHardware: Barracuda F82 Annex-B Revision A\n Firmware: 9.0.0-0511\n License status: Unlicensed, DEMO mode\n  \nAchievements so far:\n  \nWriting a python3 script that downloads a json file with ip addresses from the web (script can be provided if someone finds it useful)\n Parsing the json and getting rid of duplicates\n Writing the final IP list to a file with one CIDR entry in each line\n  \nWhere i fail:\n  \nUsing /var/phion/bin/CustomExternalAddrImport to import those CIDR IPs into the CustomExternalObject\n The command runs without errors (no message in linux is usually a good message)\n The address file disappears, but the Firewall Admin shows me an empty list\n  \nQuestions:\n  \nHas anyone done this successfully on a newer firmware build?\n Are there any logs i could plow through?

In Seattle, the Nexus switch (SE-SW) has a BGP peering with a Fortigate Firewall (SE-FGT) on AS 65010. In Silicon Valley, the Nexus switch (SV-SW) has a BGP peering with a Fortigate Firewall (SV-FGT) on AS 65011.\n Redistribution: The firewalls (SE-FGT and SV-FGT) are learning the 172.22.1.0/24 network from their respective Nexus switches (SE-SW and SV-SW) through EIGRP redistribution.\n Partner1: Both Fortigate Firewalls (SE-FGT and SV-FGT) have a BGP peering with Partner1, which advertises the 10.0.0.0/24 network.\n  \nNow, here are my questions:\n  \nDo I need to configure iBGP between SE-SW and SV-SW?

Their existing design is that they are terminating all their ISPs in the Fortigate & from there they are getting a LAN network (10.3.70.0/23 - Gateway:- 10.3.70.1) to an unmanaged switch. They have few servers on that switch & from that switch they are giving uplink to other unmanaged access switches. My work here is to configure a Core switch(9300L) which will have VLANs for Data & Voice & will handle all the inter-vlan routing & DHCP request as well as default route to the Gateway (FW). Easy, but the catch is that i can not touch the Fortigate firewall or change anything there. \n  \nIf i divide the /23 network into two /24 network, will there be any issue in the FW?\n \nIs there any way that can i put the servers on Data vlan(10.3.70.0/24) without changing their subnet mask?\n \nCan i terminate the LAN from the FW to Core in the Data vlan as an access port or is there a better way.\n \n If you have any good suggestions than feel free to let me know. \n *Sorry for the lengthy post.

The firmware file I received worked fine on the first three, but the last two are saying that the calculated md5 hash doesn't match the embedded md5 hash, and so they won't use it. I've tried with both 17.6.5 and 17.9.3. (I tried the 17.9.3 first, because it was what I was given, and after that didn't work, I thought to ask for the 17.6.5 as an intermediate step.) I've tried multiple downloads of each, but keep getting the same error.\n Now, not being a habitual Cisco person, I've been using the web gui to do these updates. I am well aware more netadmins prefer to use the cli, but I am just not good at the Cisco cli, so I avoid it. If there is something in the cli that I can use rather than the web gui, I'm willing to try it. I just don't know enough about the cli to know what to try right now. \n As for going to my corporate net admins, they are overloaded, and don't respond to tickets for months, so I can't really do much there.

Purchased 2 SFP+ MM Fiber 10Gbit fiber modules along with a 10Gbit MM fiber cable. Running a Unifi US-48-500W switch (Flow control/Jumbo Frames enabled). SFP+ Modules & MM fiber cable go directly from server SPF+ Port to SFP+ Port on switch.\n Windows shows full 10Gbit connection (Verified in Device Management that \"Speed and Duplex\" are set to \"10Gbps Full Duplex\") and Unifi Shows a 10Gbit connection in the console.\n We have 2 main NAS's configured in 802.3ad LACP (One Synology DS416 and one WD EX4100 both with RAID 5 4x 8TB drives) Both show 2000Mbps connections.\n T430 has 8x 8TB Drives and when copying a file (Not through network) from RAID to SSD boot drive, achieves ~360MBytes. So I know the RAID is at least capable of those speeds.\n Copying files from RAID to either single NAS averages around 110MBytes. I understand that LAG does not increase transfer speeds for single client as it will just use one connection technically.\n However, when trying to transfer data from the server to both NAS's, the Server NIC pegs out at 1GBit. Both NAS's should be able to take at least 1Gbit each and the server should be putting out 2GBits total.\n Also tried copying one file from Server to NAS and copying another file from Server to Desktop PC at the same time. Originally transfers around 100MBps and as soon as the 2nd file transfer starts, the server file transfer speeds are split between the two to about 50MBps each.\n Thoughts/Idea's anyone?\n    submitted by    /u/WorldlyFeature5282  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm no expert in that field but ideally shouldn't we have some logs about all the configurations in the router?

The thing is, let's say that there's a 1 second spike in the traffic, but no one was paying attention at the time and only realized it few minutes later.

          "description": "I have recently been put in charge of an expanding project for my manufacturing company. We are adding a bunch of operation technology to the manufacturing floor and the problem I am running into is that the machines on the floor are using a standard IP scheme that is apparently not able to change at mass scale and the problem is, each manufacturing line uses around 40-50 \"IPs\" locally which I am not sure what they are but for example sake lets say they are 192.168.1.0/24 network. Now the IT Network is 10.5.1.0/25 per manufacturing area. Only one or two of the devices within the 40-50 devices in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet need to be able to export its data to the 10.5.1.0/25 subnet that contains a server collecting the data. How we have been currently doing that is one to one NAT's with port level NAT's using industrial DINN network switches. The problem I am trying to solve with this, is that this requires a switch per device since these switches we are using only have 2 or 4 ports on. One port for the 192.168.1.0 IP and one for the IT Routable subnet. What I am wanting is either a fix to this without re-IPing the machines but a more central device that can handle the NAT's. I am thinking a 48 port switch that I can basically NAT the machine IP's in mass? Anyone got Ideas? If I am completely missing an easy solution please no hate.\n ​\n EDIT:: So the IE-2000, Could I implement that back at the Network cabinet and terminate all of the devices needing connected to it then have one uplink port to the OT Network and configure L2NAT instances for each interface?\n    submitted by    /u/ryguy6011  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Earlier post asking about V6 adoption. Dinosaur here, recollecting that the big issue for adoption late-90s early 2000s was that the design/policy was that enterprise V6 allocations were only from an ISP, there would be no Provider-Independent allocations. (I think this was because v4 routing tables were outpacing router memory at the time. Having ISP allocation allowed greater summarization) Naturally there was a storm every time this policy was brought up on NANOG. If one wanted to have more than one upstream for resiliency, there would be two entirely separate V6 address spaces. So a complex protocol came out of the Network Working Group: RFC 5533, Shim-6: Multi-homing Shim Protocol. When the policy was inevitably changed to PI allocations I felt so sorry for the folks who must have spent many meetings working out the Shim Protocol. PI address space allocation was the beginning of the long adoption process.\n    submitted by    /u/blahblahcat7  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am told to subnet it into three subnets: A, B, and C, where:\n  \nA has 11 hosts\n B has 12 hosts\n C has 45 hosts\n  \nIs the following approach correct?\n  \nTake log₂(#hosts + 2) -- adding 2 for network ID and broadcast addresses. So for instance in the case of subnet A I get: log₂(13) = 3.7 --> and rounding up I find that I need 4 bits.\n Then I take the number of bits and adjust the subnet mask accordingly, so again in the case of subnet A instead of using /25 I would use /28 (because the 4 LSB are 0)\n Now I want to find the range of IPs for the subnet, so for subnet A I will start from 129.19.40.1 (since .0 is reserved) and go til 129.19.40.14. The addresses ---.1 and ---.14 here will be the network ID and broadcast addresses, respectively.\n Repeat this process for the remaining subnets, resulting in:\n  \n Subnet B: Range = 129.19.40.15 - 129.19.40.29, subnet mask \\28\n Subnet C: Range = 129.19.40.30 - 129.19.40.77, subnet mask \\26\n  \nThank you in advance to anyone willing to either confirm or correct the above :)\n    submitted by    /u/theadrium  \n [link]   [comments]",

Any device attempting to receive an address from this scope just doesn't receive an offer. They're shouting into the wind and no one listens. Change that VLAN to a working one and it works just fine. \n Apparently the only difference is that one of my coworkers is working with split scope and a failover server (this is currently only the up and coming DHCP server that's going to replace an RHEL server that's still shouldering most of the load right now).\n    submitted by    /u/GreenChileEnchiladas  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We're looking at doing a refresh for our firewalls. For budget reasons our two main contenders seem to be Fortigate and Checkpoint.\n General office setup: no fancy routing so the edge devices will connect directly to the ISP over 10 Gig. Probably won't need BGP, but if we do in the future, it won't be any fancy (one ASN, one block of IPv4/6). Some SSL VPN will be used, but not heavily.\n Currently there will be only one fibre, but we'll probably get a second unit as a warm stand-by, so if the primary goes sides ways we could perhaps just move the fibre over. We may go with a second uplink later.\n Any preferences for Fortigate and Checkpoint? Palo Alto is often recommended, but that's a bit too much for us; Fortigate generally is also mentioned, but I'm curious about Checkpoint.\n Our co-lo DC will also probably need a refresh soon-ish, so we may go with the same vendor there as well. It's also currently 10Gig without HA. There we may stay with 10 Gig with the refresh, or perhaps go with a 100 Gig optic: not so much for the extra bandwidth, but for easier work with regards to provisioning and port availability: any difference with Fortigate and Checkpoint for 100G?\n Thanks for any info.\n (Internally the office gear will be access-layer PoE switches, APs, and a small server room. More familiar with switching gear, so have a good feel for the options.)\n    submitted by    /u/throw0101d  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use 3 different EIGRP AS so that the router of each office gets its default route by the ISP and redistributes it in the other EIGRP AS with a higher cost to have redundancy if the link between one office and the ISP is down.\n I wanted to take advantage of this change to simplify my architecture by using one signle OSPF area. But I don't know the best way to configure it. And that's mainly because all the routers & MLS are in the same VLAN meaning the OSPF cost from any core device to another is the same.\n Using multiple OSPF areas would probably work but I was wondering if you had better ideas.\n I've heard of the \"per-neighbor cost\" feature in OSPF but it isn't 100% clear to me if it's made for this kind of situations. Unfortunately I couldn't try in because it isn't supported in my \"simulation\" software.\n Thanks :)\n    submitted by    /u/Lilooman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know it is old tech and would be more secure and stable to use SSL.\n SSL connects okay but gives me issues when I try to load anything, from a webpage to RDP connections are incredibly slow (does not even load most of the time).

I have a few other SSL VPN connections from the same laptop that work fine through this network so I'm not sure where to start with the debugging on this one.

          "description": "Hello Reddit, \n I am looking for some advice from individuals who definitely know more then me. \n I work for a small business and I am trying to help improve the network for security purposes. Currently we run the Meraki Go system in our 4 locations. It leaves a lot to be desired. The other day the firewall in one location had a port failure and their app never showed us that was the issue. We discovered it when we switched the ethernet cable from one port to the other. I find that defeats the purpose. It should clearly have shown me this was happening, but still it does not tell me there is a port failure. In the end, I just feel this system is not developed enough and I want to move on. \n I considered Barracuda, Palo Alto and Fortinet, but honestly, their price point, the business owner will not go for it. Not even close. \n Then I discovered Firewalla, its a lot closer to what I want, especially with the VPN system and MSP they have, but their yearly subscription really makes a reasonably priced product and decently expensive product. \n I thought I would pose this question to the /reddit world. Any alternative solutions I should look at, that may provide a solution that is better than meraki go, but more reasonable then firewalla. Or if Firewalla really is the real deal and I should sell my boss. Or, alternative solutions. \n Thanks for your time guys. \n Colin\n    submitted by    /u/colinbuffalo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone. I'm in a bit of a dead-end and was wondering if anyone here has any ideas. I know this is EOL hardware, but unfortunately that's what we have...\n Here is my saga: I have a Cisco 3750X-24P-L which I want to stack with a 3750-48P-S\n The reason I need to stack these is, apart from port density, the fact that the 3750X has PoE+ and a 10G uplink.\n The challenges:\n The 3750-48P-S can only run IOS 12, since it only has 16mb of internal flash, and IOS15 doesn't fit.\n The 3750X-24P-L is originally licensed with lanbase, which doesn't allow it to stack with non-lanbase switches. If I upgrade it to IOS15, I'm able to activate the RTU license and have it boot ipservice or ipbase, which would allow me to stack, but you can't stack IOS12 with IOS15.\n In IOS 12, I don't seem to be able to activate a RTU license, even with a \"universal\" image.\n In IOS12 it seems you can activate a 90day trial license of ipservices, I've tried that, but it seems my 90 days were already used. (These switches are old, before I worked here, and someone might have activated the trial in the past).\n I have tried formating the flash to see if the trial resets, or even changing the date, but no luck.\n Considering these switches are EOL and EOS, is there any other alternative?

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n We are currently facing a design issue with our Azure Expressroute setup, specifically with BGP between Microsoft (MS) and our Fortinet solution. Our setup involves two connections (two VLANs) from the firewall to Azure, and we have decided against using ECMP for various reasons. Therefore, we require an Active-Passive setup.\n For normal operation, we have successfully configured the Active-Passive setup using path prepending and local preference to determine the appropriate connection. When one of the peers goes down, failover occurs without any issues.\n However, we have encountered a problem during maintenance activities. If Azure initiates maintenance on the primary link, the BGP neighborship remains active, but traffic cannot flow through the connection. Before starting maintenance, MS pre-pends the primary connection. Unfortunately, since we rely on local preference, this pre-pending does not resolve the issue, as the local preference takes precedence over the prepending value.\n We have been attempting to collaborate with the Azure side (another IT supplier) to consistently pre-pend the secondary connection. This would allow us to eliminate the dependency on local preference. However, it seems that Azure does not support this configuration.\n Are there others who have experienced similar issues? We would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this challenge. Unfortunately, we have limited options since MS does not terminate the BGP neighborship during maintenance.\n Thank you for your assistance.\n    submitted by    /u/Tribunus-  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope I chose right. \n Here's my scenario: I was provisioned /30 (Comcast calls this the Layer 3 IP Information) and a /29 (Customer Usable IP Information) provided by Comcast for fiber circuit and I need to install a switch at my headquarters. Their Juniper Switch is the last devices within their responsibility and has one port configured to give my switch .102 in the /30.\n I'm getting a Layer 3 switch eventually but I'd like to bring this circuit up sooner (back order).\n Here are some questions:\n  \nDo I need to use a Layer 3 switch or can I just use an unmanaged switch and configure the adapters on the things I plug in like my voice appliance and my firewall? \n I have a layer 3 switch available with some open ports. Can I segment those ports into a different VLAN? I'm not totally sure how to do this but I think it can be done.\n  \nThanks!\n    submitted by    /u/EnusTAnyBOLuBeST  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tonight I migrated over one of our lower end environments across to them, all went fine, security rules worked great etc.. the main issue was around a NAT rule I wanted to use for each environment, basically, we have a public address ranges that our WAN external firewalls sit on and an entirely different /27 public routed range that isn't on the same subnet etc.. this range is used on the current t ASA solution for certain environments, I wanted to use the free ones and migrate the ones in use across to the PA's in the end. To begin with I was using a free public address in this routed range to put on this environment along with a catch-all PAT to the outside interface as an alternative. Currently during my testing on one of my test vm's, the outside PAT works fine, however, when I turned on the source NAT to this free public address tonight, traffic dropped and stopped on my test VM! I have no clue why. The rule itself is setup like this:\n Scr zone : inside Dst zone : Internet Scr add : lower end environment range Dst add : any Scr translation : dynamic-ip-and-port to the public ip address object which is a /32 Dst translation: none\n Can someone tell me if I'm missing something here on the PA's? The NAT rule, security rule where both being hit on the counter and I could see the NAT sessions being natted to the routed public address as well on the CLI. Could it just be something the other end with our PE router providers?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use the SD-WAN side of things, but I wouldn't know where to start with the firewall features of them. I'm thinking it's a non starter, purely because of time that is available to me, how do they perform under stress or normal load using an SSL proxy, and normal firewall rule processing? It's a router first and foremost and shouldn't be used as a firewall if we don't have to, simple as essentially. But I'm curious to know if others have used them for this purpose and what their experiences have been?\n The Palo I'll end up getting in probably won't need more than 1Gb interfaces as well to be honest, if that helps in terms of bandwidth\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

No pings to gateway or other devices even when I have a valid manual IP address on the subnet. \n So maybe the switch is being weird? Nope, put in a new switch, exact same behavior.\n So I thought, maybe the APs are meshed into the bridge AP, or maybe into the main building APs directly?

Why do they do this and is it suboptimal?\n Almost everything (~150 devices) is on static IP address, but I believe that the devices are inconsistent in their subnet configuration; that is to say some have been configured 255.255.255.0 and some have been configured 255.255.0.0. Is this the cause for the ARP?\n Thanks for any assistance!\n    submitted by    /u/flxbrown  \n [link]   [comments]",

All other devices are usually getting 150-200 download speeds and 300-400 upload speeds. Even when I bypass the firewall and connect directly to the ISP's Adva FSP 150, none of the devices I'm trying (mix of Dell Latitudes and Lenovo Thinkpads) are getting the correct speed.\n ISP verified duplex speed was set to 1000Mbps Auto (Fortinet firewall was set manually to 1000Full and auto-negotiate, no change). There don't seem to be any packets being dropped. I've tried setting the DNS manually (the server itself, google, cloudfare) on the end devices to see if that changes anything, but no change there. Bandwidth usage is normal. Tried troubleshooting during active hours and also after hours, no change in speed. Tried adjusting TCP Window Scaling Settings on end-devices, updating drivers, verifying cables were un-damaged CAT5e or CAT6 cables, trying different network profile settings on end-devices, manually setting IP information, checked for malware...\n Can anyone offer me any advice or tips as to what I should be looking for here?

When I came into this effort to help a buddy, it was setup already using native Azure VPN gateway/etc.... there's also an Azure Firewall but it's not doing much currently. So the main issue is the distant end with the server wants the client to only come across the VPN using one public IP.... here's the fun part... for Azure VPN DHCP Pools it has to be a /29 or greater... so I can't just issue the client one public and call it a day. Additionally, the S2S VPN is using policy based traffic selectors and as such I can't also turn on NAT to turn a private pool into one \"port overloaded\" public IP. I also apparently can't just slap a NAT Gateway in there because when I attach a private subnet to it, and try to use that same subnet for VPN pool addresses, it throws overlap errors.\n ​\n So I guess in summary..... what is the right design strategy for this situation given the technical limitations (oh and they can't change their end until the next change window next week if we need to try anything, so we're just trying to figure out what we can do from our Azure end for now, if anything).\n ​\n Part of me thinks I should just slap a Palo VM on there, do globalprotect and a site 2 site and let the palo take care of NAT without complaining like Azure has been at me, but palo's are like $6k a month in azure, and part of me wonders if I should be using azure's native firewall in the mix in some way to help the situation or if I'm not using other native features correctly enough to get this straight.\n ​\n Any advice is appreciated, sorry for the wall of text, and RIP my favorite 3rd party reddit app soon =[\n    submitted by    /u/syntax24  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm trying to figure out how to best setup a wireless mesh network network that utilizes multiple gateways in order to minimize the amount of hops needed to reach WAN.\n Say we have a very long linear mesh (bunch of nodes on a string) in a tunnel. For each hop we loose some throughput, so if we only have one router as the gateway at say one of the ends, at the other end we will have much decreased performance. I could setup the mesh such that the nodes at the first third will use router A as the gateway, the next third uses router B and the last third uses router C. This works fine, except we of course get dropped connections every time we roam from one third to another and the routers don't act as a failover for each other. Additionally, the roaming is slower when effectively switching between networks.\n One topology I've thought about it having each of routers A,B and C use another fourth router D as their gateway such that then at least at the connections come from the same place and then perhaps it would be possible to perhaps have a stable phone call throughout the tunnel when roaming.\n Problem is that I'm frankly a little too green to figure this out entirely on my own. I guess what I'm looking for is called multi-WAN or multi-home? What sort of topology and/or setups would you use in this situation?\n    submitted by    /u/bionor  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each site has a pair of core switches that handle the intersite connections. Site A connects to site B via 2x1Gb links currently in a L3 Portchannel. Site B to Site C is single 1Gb and site C back to site A is single 1Gb link (all those using L2 connection with SVI's). Site B is getting an upgrade to Nexus cores so we will no longer be able to run a L3 PC with VPC back to Site A.\n I am curious what you guys would do with this topology. I am contemplating running routed links everywhere like this. Will EIGRP ECMP this traffic and utilize both paths by default or is their additional configuration that needs to be done? Any other pros/cons to this design?\n Another option I am tossing around is doing a simple L2-VPC and running SVI at both ends like this.\n I would love to hear your thoughts and talk through the different solutions here.

          "description": "Hi,\n a number of ISP's including AltNets are using DHCP to assign IP's where in the past they would have used PPPoE. I'm just wondering why the transition & how they are ensuring accountability. \n I've worked for a number of global ISP's in enterprise services but never in the broadband space so just wondering how they ensure they meet the challenge of being able to be certain that a certain IP actually belongs to a specific customer.\n It's not that hard to change the advertised MAC & IP of the device connecting to their network, I guess they could tie the customer IP to their demarc interface & be certain that anything coming into their demarc is from that subscriber regardless of MAC or IP.\n Just curious as to how they meet the audibility regulatory requirement without the customer using a username & password to authenticate their conenction.\n    submitted by    /u/iPhrase  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n Is anyone also experiencing memory leak issue in their ACX1100? We have experienced multiple occurrences of memory leak on ACX1100 installed and would require reboot to be performed as workaround for the router to be performing again. Have verified that ACX1100 due to its design limitations, memory leak is occurring due to routes and/or routing processes which the router cannot handle. Would like to know if anyone have encountered the same issue and what has been the resolution in your network scenario.\n Monitored that memory leak on the ACX persists even after upgrading JUNOS from 20.2R2-S1.3 to 20.4R1.12. Verifying with JTAC, memory leak is triggered due to device configuration but the root cause for the permanent fix is due to software PR. I am still awaiting next service release for JUNOS 20.4R3-S8 to confirm with Juniper if memory leak issue finally resolved for next service release.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Aggravating_Ad5919  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings:\n We are upgrading from a pair of SN2010 (eighteen 10/25Gb ports + four 100Gb ports) to a pair of SN2100 (sixteen 100Gb ports) for our TOR switches. These switches are all running the Onyx operating system.\n We have deployed several sets of SN2010 switches for us and our clients over the past four years. We decided to upgrade to SN2100 to get more port density by using 100Gb optics and breakout cables. \n We configured a SN2100 switch and swapped it in for one of our SN2010 switches. \n This issue we are having is that whenever we connect a host one of the four breakout pairs, the port flaps every 30 seconds. We have configured the new switch port identically to our existing switches and connected to existing hosts that have Mellanox NICs in them. \n When we connect the same 10/25Gb breakout to another switch, we have no issues. We only experience the issue when we connect a host (server or workstation) with SFP+. \n We've used a 100Gb to 25Gb converter with both an optical transceiver as well as DAC cable and get the same results; the port stays up when connected to another switch (Mellanox or other brand) and the port flaps when that same connection terminates into a host (server or workstation).\n During the time the port is up, we have connectivity.\n Any ideas what this might be or what to try next?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/tmcmillan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I started a Network Engineering role back in November 2022. I like the job but today I was told about another job as a Senior Network Engineer at an MSP for about 20K more. \n I was always taught that you stay with your company and show loyalty, but later in life I had a Network Engineer tell me that people always bounce around in IT careers. \n The company I work for now is a family-owned company where people stay for many years if not their whole career (Non-IT). I like what I do and it is easy. Not really challenging I just don't know if I should take the advice of moving around. I have never worked for an MSP. I am wondering if I should just stick it out or take the money. \n I feel like if I leave the company I am with now that I will burn a bridge that I cannot come back to. \n I guess the question is how long do you all stay at a job before taking another?\n    submitted by    /u/txcjsh28  \n [link]   [comments]",
