It seems to work fine for smaller sites, but the larger the customer, the more problems they have with it.\n I am migrating on prem shares into Sharepoint - giving each share its own site. I then either deploy the share via Intune so that it appears in the Explorer sidebar, or simply have the customer \"add shortcut to OneDrive\" \n The thing is, I'm constantly having OneDrive sync issues. Either it gets stuck syncing, doesn't sync everything, gives errors when downloading cloud files through explorer etc, and it's overall a very poor experience for the customer. \n Doing things via the web browser is fine, but doesn't offer the old school functionality of accessing files via explorer.\n What am I doing wrong? It's driving me up the wall! The amount of times I've had to reinstall OneDrive/resync data is absurd.\n    submitted by    /u/BNR33  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is fine, I've created the relevant DNS records and such, and all is well. However, the way Mailchimp links images rather than embeds means that Outlook doesn't display images by default. The only way around this, that I'm aware off, is to set the sender in Safe (Trusted) Senders and Domains for all users\n I've done this via a PowerShell script:\n ``` Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName user@example.com \n $users = Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox \n foreach ($user in $users) {\n Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration \"$($user.UserPrincipalName)\" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add=\"mail.example.com\"} }\n ```\n I have also try to only do one user, eg. Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration \"user@example.com\" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add=\"mail.example.com\"}\n Either way I do this though, the change shows up when I look at junk settings in OWA or Outlook 365 desktop, but within 10 minutes, it's no longer in there, almost as if the change has been undone\n If I manually add the domain to my safe senders list, it remains there absolutely fine, so I don't believe this is some rogue setting or script that's clearing out the safe senders list\n    submitted by    /u/DeifniteProfessional  \n [link]   [comments]",

All RDS have 16 Cores and 64 GB Ram and sitting on a full flash SAN. No GPU. All virtualized on Hyper-V 2019.\n Sometimes user reporting that the server feels slow. If i go to the user and look at his problem i can confirm this problem. The monitoring of the host itself seems okay. CPU wise we are about 20 % with some peaks, but very rarely over 80 %. RAM wise also about 60 %. Disk i/o and network are not real latency. \n The problems for the users are mostly slow responding applications (not crashing) while moving the windows, latency on typing in different applications, and some other stuff. \n For a small test i removed our anti virus (Sophos) but that does not help.\n If i read some old threads here on reddit most other people have much more user per server without issues. So it does not seem an issue on the user/server ratio.\n ATM i'm thinking about buying a hardware server with an GPU to test it. Hyper-V does not really support GPU partitioning or passthrough.

It didn’t. Awesome.\n Now: DC1 is online, DC2 is offline but never demoted (and VM has no NIC config), DC02 (new VM) is a trigger pull away from backing up DC1.\n Questions: 1) If I add DC02 as a DC to the domain using “any dc” as a replication source, can I change this later? (Because I might like to make this “only DC1,” temporarily, which brings us to… 2) I want to bring DC2 online to properly demote it, but how can I ensure it won’t torpedo DC1 with bad/redundant records as soon as they reunite? Can I just (while DC2 still has no network config) set their sync relationship to be 1-way, give it network access again, demote it, shut it down for good? 3) Depending on 2)’s answer, should DC02 be held offline and not joined to the domain until DC2 is gone for good? Or is it safer to add it, test it, then shut it down while sorting DC1&2 so that, if they implode, I can just shut them down and bring up DC02?\n    submitted by    /u/GreatContagion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Dehydrated and its helpers are all bash scripts, so I was able to throw set -o xtrace at the top to see what bash was running, and this was the offending block:\n cliip=`$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip` while ! valid_ip $cliip; do sleep 2 cliip=`$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip` done \n This is a block of code in the Dehydrated helper script for Namecheap, that detects the running machine's IP. Except if the call fails, it gets stuck forever sleeping every 2 seconds and trying again. And as it turns out, the v4 and v6 subdomains to ifconfig.co were deprecated in 2018 and finally removed in January sometime.\n So the upshot is that v4.ifconfig.co/ip should be changed to ifconfig.co and your Dehydrated/Namecheap setup will come back to life.\n Also, set -o xtrace is a lifesaver for debugging Bash scripts that are getting stuck.\n    submitted by    /u/OrangeredStilton  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long time lurker here...\n I'm working on a moving project, we've rented a rack in a DC and want to move our whole infra there and I'd like to get rid of our tape library... I know they are immutable and great but I hate them and being the only guy that has to remember to buy, replace, store, and tag all the tapes is starting to suck.\n I've eyed this HPE storeOnce solution, we use Veeam for our backups, and the hypervisor is hyper-v (corporate decision) backups are running ok with a 3-2-1 approach, but as I said, being storeOnce with Catalyst kinda immutable I wanted to get feedback about this in order to hopefully switch to that instead of tapes. \n My main questions are:\n - is the deduplication that good? I've read about a 20:1 ratio (for storage planning)\n - has the catalyst technology ever created issues in your environment? Have you replaced other immutable backup means like tapes with that? \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Hornet89  \n [link]   [comments]",

And ideally this same company sells the services to execute too or there are recommendations on companies they take the results and offer services to fix and execute.\n Backstory: Recently joined a company as an executive and realize that its entire environment has been thrown together by a couple inexperienced IT support employees. No fault of their own, the company started mom and pop small business and rapidly exploded into a national player and these guys just kept the lights on. There is no asset management, no end point management, no understanding of how to streamline/control data, (literally zero governance), etc. To better know what we don’t know so we can add the right people to the existing team, we are hoping to pay lots of $$$$ to have a trusted company contracted to “fix” us up so we can take it from there.\n    submitted by    /u/Throwaway546473  \n [link]   [comments]",

Server1 is setup as a Hyper-V server hosting 4 vms (2016 servers) and roughly 15 TBs of data including an sql server that is the bulk of the data. \n Server2 is identical to Server1; processor, ram, partitions,etc. This is a fresh server, only Hyper V installed. I have not moved/copied over any vms or data data, just installed a the same roles and applied some updates. Figured over a weekend I’d save off the VMs and import them into server2 and robocopy daily to sync data. Would this work? \n My mission is to figure out a way to have the “in production” server1 in building A sync or mirror to server2 in building B (fiber). In the event of a disaster I’d be able to move server2 into production and keep folks working. Servers are on the same domain, network, vlan and can see one another. \n Is it possible to set server1 up to regularly sync everything including vms and their data to server2 in real-time or hourly/bi-hourly intervals using robocopy? I’m okay with daily, but hourly would be better. MS best practices? Not opposed to 3rd party software, but would prefer a free Microsoft option if available (limited resources). \n Any help is greatly appreciated.

          "description": "Hey, just a quick ramble and I am curious how others see this scenario since it is a very common one. We have about 1000 users in our environment, everyone works from home 3 days per week. The users connect to a VPN from home, just like almost every other company.\n We've had MFA rolled out for a long time with SMS authentication, but recently one of the C-suites was targeted in a SIM swap. We're now switching over to an authenticator-based solution which requires users to have an authenticator app on their phones. It has been going well, but we have a small handful of users (about 10) who are adamantly against using their phones for anything work-related. These users all have smartphones, so there is no technical limitation stopping them from being able to install the authenticator app.\n My ideology is that phones, like internet at home, or like transportation to and from work, are all things that an employee are expected to have. Everyone already understands that they can connect to their own home Wifi to then access our VPN and connect to our corporate network, and that is taking some bandwidth from their other devices. I'm not really seeing the difference between those two use cases as we aren't monitoring their phones, or adding any MDM solution to them. They could feel that way but I'd expect them to already feel that way by connecting a corporate laptop to their home network.\n I know most companies provide cell phones or stipends to employees for phone services if they are expected to use their phones for work purposes but no employee is expected to do anything besides receive a 6-digit code to authenticate when logging in to our systems.\n Management requested us to just set up a group for users who refuse to just leave their policy to only require SMS authentication.\n    submitted by    /u/Beznia  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's impossible to do that on servers, you have to use a customer's pc. And don't even try to connect a USB cable before completing the in-app procedure!\n Then half of those printers... they just doesn't work.\n A few of them doesn't connect to their \"HP Web Services\", the majority are stuck with a \"complete the configuration...\" message.

          "description": "Long time lurker, first time poster on this account, thanks for all the information shared. We have a corporate partner (CP) that manages an existing tenant. Meanwhile, we are our own standalone org and aren't required to use the CP's services. Being on enterprise M365 licenses, we've been able to use the Power Platform (Power Automate, Apps, BI, etc) with great success but we keep running hitting ceilings on what we can do without admin access.\n Some of those things would be account creation automation based on roles, dynamic group memberships, Azure AD (we have traditional on prem DC), SharePoint customization, use of Intune, etc. All that is cool, but when the C-Suite learned the CP can technically access all of our email, OneDrive, etc, they became very committed rolling our own tenant. \n So here we are! We've been reading up on implementing a non-routable domain into a hybrid Azure AD setup, email management, MFA setup, what the a transition looks like for our end users, etc but we all know academic knowledge vs implementation experience are two very different things. Fwiw, our CP is supportive of the transition so bad blood and politics shouldn't be a factor here.\n What are your thoughts on best practices, things you would be looking out for, general advice given this scenario? \n TL;DR We're moving away from a tenant managed by a 'provider' to our own in-house management, asking best practices, advice for setup, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/DucksAreOdd  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I never expect much from Microsoft Support, it usually takes plenty of back and forth before you can ever make progress if it ever does happen. But my last experience with them left me dumbfounded.\n I raised a ticket for an issue that inadvertently affected all of our mobile users, and upon their first email to me I was told it would be escalated to their intune team. I recieved one email from intune support asking to provide relevant information, then radio silence for the next 3 weeks. I sent maybe 4 followups asking when I would get a response, but to no avail.\n Fast forward to today, I finally get an email from them saying they have been trying to reach out to me but I must be busy so they will archive the ticket. Scrolling through the email thread, yes they have been \"trying to reach out\", but all of their emails after the initial one to gather more info were sent to my email address except with the domain slightly misspelled. The thread is full of NDR's.\n I find it hard to believe that someone employed as an intune specialist would not realize that receiving NDR's that my email address does not exist would not realize that I'm not receiving the emails. And what a coincidence that they finally got my email address correct when sending the case closure email. I guess their reply button must have been broken and causing my domain to be misspelled on all the emails where they try to offer assistance.\n Anyways I'm just here to rant, after several days and hundreds of re-enrollments we have gotten things under control.

          "description": "I work from home about 2/3rds of the time and spend the other 1/3rd in the office. When working from home I always RDP into my office workstation and for the most part I've had no issues. I have a 3 monitor setup at both work and home. The office workstation is almost 10 years old, and I'm attempting to upgrade to a newer box which is much better equipped but RDP access to the box is much slower, lags, and the most annoying thing is that upon connection the screen flashes black for a couple of minutes (but not every time) before finally settling down. Performance when physically at the box is good, definitely better than the 10yr old box. Both are in the same OU, Have the same Windows 10 Enterprise image, and have the same Group Policy applied. I've disabled the RDP hardware graphics acceleration which my research shows to be a cause of the flashing screen upon connection. I use RDP in the course of my daily routine on various devices and have never encountered an issue like this, RDP is generally something that just works and most of the time I can't even tell that I'm connected to a remote box. It doesn't appear to be a client side issue or a multi monitor issue, performance is consistent if I'm connected across the VPN or locally from any device and no errors are indicated in the event log. \n For a number of functional and psychological reasons I need a physical box that I use both when at home and at the office. Do you have any recommendations on how to improve RDP performance on this new box? \n Here are the specs:\n New:\n HPZ2 G9 i7-12700, 32GB ram, Nvidia RTX A2000\n Old:\n i7-3930K, 32GB ram, Nvidia GeForce GTX 660\n    submitted by    /u/jstar77  \n [link]   [comments]",

The LUN is published to all hosts, and that cannot be changed from the SAN (AFAIK).\n One of our people build two new hypervisors recently, both of which have attached this \"access\" disk along with the legitimate volumes they need. It appears in disk manager as a 20mb offline disk. Diskpart tells me it is set to be read only.\n The issue I can see is the system log being overrun with constant NTFS errors, all pointing to the GUID of this disk.\n I want to take this disk offline on the hosts, but not sure about any possible ramifications (it seems OK since it looks like some sort of named pipe style channel for use by the dell management utility), and not sure the safest way to remove the volume without affecting the other LUNs on the same iSCSI target.\n Does anyone have any hints or tips for me?\n Thanks for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/ExcellencePursuit  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't really find anything on this, it is easy to mitigate right now but the force shutdowns are going to take a toll.\n Thank you for any help!\n    submitted by    /u/justAcazyadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

This involved varied tasks such as helping the foundation crews break big rocks into smaller rocks, or pulling a softball sized wad of human shit and used tampons out of the building's sewage masticater by hand.

Because of this the users were already set up with beefy workstation laptops and docking stations at home and every office desk before I started at the company.\n The problem is that the CAD files are stored on a central fileserver in the office and when the users work remotely they work off an SMB connection to the office over VPN which results in extremely slow access speeds and file corruptions.\n I wanted to set them up with individual tower PCs at the office instead or at least a pool of a few PCs in the office and let them connect to those remotely with RDP. Though firstly the boss doesn’t like that option because he wants everyone to be able to work at every desk and secondly the test engineers complain about latency problems regarding their 3D work in programs like Revit and AutoCAD. For example they say rotating the view is too cumbersome over the remote connection. I’m currently testing parsec instead of RDP but that has similar problems and is quite buggy.\n So my question is, how do you make occasional remote work, preferably with laptops, work for resource heavy CAD users working from a shared network drive?\n    submitted by    /u/purplepersonality  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of those pins carrying PoE is bonded with the chassis, which I'm guessing is really a powder-coated metal. When you use the metal mounting plate and that is touching metal it makes a nice circuit, then the Ubiquity PoE switch shuts off PoE. \n The AP works great with a grounded or ungrounded patch to the biscuit jack, just as long as it isn't touching anything metal. Swapped it out with an AP that was working fine mounted to a plywood sheet just to be sure it exhibited the same symptoms. It did.\n Doing my best not to rant, we spent a lot of time on this.

Now, the last thing I want to do is go over his head to our CTO and I’ve asked him a few times if he was comfortable signing but keeps asking me to go back to the supplier and have them confirm the most minute of details which have no impact on him signing the proposal. Should I speak with my direct manager and ask his advice and maybe HE can push my director into signing it sooner rather than later?

I've seen cheap adapters like this but I'm unsure if they'll do what I need:https://www.amazon.com/Wixine-Board-Small-Adapter-SFF-8482/dp/B08DLX9YD5?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A1RV7R81U3FOKU\n Before I bought anything else I did want to see if the drive was working with what I already had laying around.I got a working T3600 with a working H310 for free last week that appears to have the latest software on it, but it couldn't see the SSD in Physical Disk Management. It had a SATA SSD in it for a boot drive and all of that worked fine before I went to switching things around. Although I'm quite certain Windows on the poor little Patriot SSD was corrupted at some point. RIP\n I could feel the U.2 slightly warm when it was plugged in which was a good sign. Physical Disk Management couldn't see it. I'm not sure if I need a new cable or other components to get this working correctly just so I can make sure the drive is good. I'm pretty green on this topic. Figured I'd come to the experts. I've done a good bit of research and asked r/IT what this even was to get the ball rolling in the right direction. I'm realizing how strange my request truly is. What would you do in my situation?\n    submitted by    /u/Jfunkey_  \n [link]   [comments]",

When an employee leaves the company, if the supervisor needs access to to their email account afterwards, we keep the user licensed and convert their email to a shared mailbox. We then remove the user license. After a month or so the supervisor will let us know that they no longer need access to the email and so we convert it back to a regular mailbox. As that user no longer has a license I assumed the inbox would disappear and senders would get a bounce back. Seems instead that the users inbox still exists and is receiving messages even though it is not licensed. I am not concerned with backups as we have that covered in another system. I am just curious what the correct method would be to remove the shared mailbox so that it disappears and users get a bounce back if they try to send to it.

          "description": "I stumbled across a feature in Windows Server 2022 called SMB Compression which, according to my understanding, allows quicker transfer of files over your network by compressing files (if you tell it to). The concept seems relatively straight forward, I think in practice you can use SMB Compression by:\n • Using Robocopy with a /compress switch in your CLI\n • Mapping a network drive using Net using the /requestcompression:yes switch\n • Enabling this option in the Windows Admin Center on a File Server so file copying will default to using compression when end users copy to or from the network share folder on a server with this option enabled.\n My question is - is my relative understanding of this feature, more or less, accurate? Also when it comes to file compression, don't you lose quality when it comes to files such as jpegs, or does it compress the files to transfer them, thus lowering bandwidth requirements, and then decompress the files once it reaches the destination?\n Is this feature relatively esoteric? There really seems like no downsides unless the files stay compressed. Any admins out there successfully utilize this? Thanks all.\n    submitted by    /u/TCIE  \n [link]   [comments]",

We got what we needed from them and kicked them out, and now have no contact.\n One of my requests to the MSP before departure was to remove us from their partner portal, as I have no ability to do that from the tenant. Surprise, this was never done! I've contacted MS \"support\" through the O365 admin page and they've basically told me to go fuck myself and it's stuck there forever. For luck I've put in about 20 tickets on this, one actually got close. I feel like MS can absolutely do this if I fill out 700 forms and what not. \n Is there any way I can get this relationship off the tenant? Every time I need to purchase licenses it gets in the way by two clicks, and I'm tired of being reminded that an MSP has us in their poral somewhere. Their access is neutered but it still feels like they're part of the setup when they aren't.\n    submitted by    /u/Timithius  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A little background. I started at this place fairly recently. Just prior to me starting, their accounting department decided to move from some antique accounting software, to using quickbooks. The sysadmin before me set them up with QB desktop and with the company files hosted on VM at a remote data center (which is a couple hundred miles away).\n Big surprise, the previous guy apparently never read the documentation from QB that clearly states accessing a company file over VPN is a shit show. Its massively slow. Like often taking 10+ minutes for a company file to open. To make things worse, the accounting department is using quickbooks in an unusual way, where they have hundreds of company files that all need to be accessible to the ~20 accountants. So throughout the day theyre switching between files and literally spending hours waiting on shit to load. Also, this means quickbooks online is not an option, because you pay per company file, and the service would be absurdly expensive.\n My first thought was to set up a NAS locally and based on some testing, this works great. Its nearly as fast as having the company files on the host. But to throw another wrench in things, the accountants often need to work from home. The DC and ASA are at the data center, and when using VPN from home theyre tunneling all the way to this data center and then all the way back to our office. This is actually so slow that most of the time you cant even open a company file.\n I know the proper solution is to run QB in a VM and use RDS, which I could easily do at our data center, but for whatever reason my boss is vehemently against this option.\n At this point I kind of at a loss.

For instance, we have a client who has an office attached to their house and they all share the same network. It was deemed by my bosses that the reason the office was experiencing slow connections within the application they use is because of the switch they were using. That something might have \"happened\" to it or it went bad. They proceeded to buy 2 switches: 1 for the home network and the other for the office network. I traced the offices lines, plugged each respective line into the dedicated switches and plugged them into the ports I was told to in their firewall. \n After everything was all said and done, I come back to the office and asked my supervisor \"couldn't we have just made things easier by using one switch and separate the network using VLANS?\". He responded \"Well, if something were to happen to the switch, such as a shock to the system, the switch would reset & lose all configurations which would cause havoc\". I was sitting there thinking to myself....well then by that reasoning, why everything else? Everything in tech is just as susceptible to that scenario. If you propose that scenario, then why even have managed switches? \n I recognize that that is an extreme scenario he gave but how realistic is that? Has that ever happened to anyone?

Network C is the main network, and Network X is the secondary network I have in my office to remote into other off sites.\n Once I captured the scans they appear to be completely different ways of communicating. I can see the the app on the C network communicates using HTTP 1.1 and it goes through a few hoops. I can see the app on X network communicates via DNS. The scans for X Network do not show HTTP linked to this app at all and the scans for C Network do not show DNS at all. The DNS method is much quicker than the HTTP method.\n My question is does that mean that the older C Network is using older/different networking protocols to launch/connect to the app? Does that mean that our newer X Network is using a DNS network to automatically connect the app each time making it quicker?\n I would post the scans but there's confidential information in the data.\n    submitted by    /u/moderatenerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, at our company I was tasked with finding a RMA software solution for managing defective products returns that we could implement locally or (preferably) buy a cloud solution. We don't have big requirements so the software should (at least) be able to connect to our existing local ERP, to get customer and our products data, should support/have built-in RMA forms for customers to send us their RMA requests and get RMA progress updates (optionally some sort of barebone ticketing system or simply sending update e-mails) and have scheduled or ondemand reporting capability for our management (so we can identify products with most defects, what are those defects, etc.).\n We are not a big company with only around 50 employees, but have quite a few customers (we manufacture products for customers) so the software solution should be a reliable one.\n Thank you in advance for your recommendations!\n    submitted by    /u/Red-dy-20  \n [link]   [comments]",

We wanted Intune or a similar solution so we can finally move away from having to type in a users password (especially if they already work for us) and setup the laptop manually. Got rejected for it being too expensive for everyone. On my question on how we should move forward with this as setting up laptops manually takes a lot of time, time which we could use for productive work, they told us to just hire students.\n This will be fun when we up our workforce by roughly a third this year and have them all start working on the same day. This will totally work and we will totally won't have issues with this approach, because giving some random students laptops with little to no possible oversight who are doing a brain-dead task will work out.\n So any ideas on other solutions? We will have to deploy devices on a regular basis for all offices and a person having to wait 1-2 business days to work again (us shipping them a device from HQ or in that office a student being there setting up a device) is not an option\n    submitted by    /u/Auno94  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a systems engineer for a national healthcare company. We recently decom'd a data center and used a company to relocate a piece of hardware to another one of our datacenters several states away, and used a second company to take away the remaining old decom'd hardware that we no longer needed.\n I've handled nearly all of the quoting, selections, and coordination during this process. On the day for both companies to perform their duties, it was just a disaster. Neither company should've had the problems that they had, putting us in situations we shouldn't have had to be in. This is not the first time I've dealt with bad IT recycling companies...\n It got me thinking and throwing an idea around with a couple of friends. One, an owner of a small trucking company, and another who's a CPA and a part-time small business owner. We're thinking of forming an IT relocation, destruction, and recycling company.\n What issues have you had dealing with these companies? What kind if services are you looking for in such a company? Are you looking for such a company to quickly and simply haul away your old equipment, or do you have equipment of value that you no longer need, and want to have such a company pay some for it to be able to resell? Do you only care about certificates of destruction? Do you want said company to do all the labor, un-racking all your old gear and handle the entire decom/relocation process, or simply have them pick up the already removed hardware, ready to go at the dock? What's most important to you? If quotes of two companies were identical, what would make you choose one over the other? \n It seems like there's a lot of players in the industry, but I haven't had a company provide these services without throwing wrenches into the works. To err is human, but a lot of the mistakes and issues I've seen are completely avoidable. I can do better.\n You wanna talk me out of it? Why? You wanna talk me into it?

Our environment is a hybrid AD/Azure AD and due to the nature of our business we will likely remain that way for a long time. Our users are already logging in with smartcard but we are looking for something a little more modern. \n With smartcard login already established we have all of the PKI, DC, and other pre-reqs in place for the key trust method. It seems like enabling this would be as simple as adding the Azure AD user to the Key admins group, and enabling the GPO on a few test accounts. \n Reading through the docs i see MS is now heavily pushing the cloud trust method over the key trust. The big driver is simplicity without the needs for all the PKI and other setup. \n Sometimes what MS pushes is whats best for them and not for the customer. So what are your thoughts with the existing PKI in place if you were doing a new WHfB setup would you go key trust or cloud trust. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/teeawayfour  \n [link]   [comments]",

The keyvault did not have the soft delete feature as it was an \"old\" one, the feature was not enabled by default back then.\n Now the database is completely impossible to recover as the backup are also encrypted. We effectively have lost 4 years worth of data give or take.\n I don't know what will happen to me yet, I know that my boss is pissed off, the CTO is pissed off, and I am pissed off at myself lol.\n How do you cope with those kind of situations ?\n Details : \n Just giving some context as to why I deleted the fucking keyvault. It had a funny name (not standard at all), with only one key, the key had the name of a server that was deleted since 2020. Turns out the DBA used the same key to encrypt the server that replaced it. \n As I was trying to clean up our Azure subscriptions, because we have tons of unused resources, I thought this one was safe to delete.\n I immediediatly enabled both soft delete and purge protection for all our keyvaults after this mistake.\n    submitted by    /u/HeavenlyRen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I hope this helps someone, we have been running down this very very frustrating path for awhile now. At first I did not believe it was isolated to the new machines our support team was deploying (Latitude 3310) but we have confirmed that to be the case.\n Issue: Users were reporting that during the day Outlook would become disconnected and refuse to re-establish connectivity without rebooting the device. Teams would also have similar issues. A reboot \"fixed\" it for a couple hours. In the AAD logs token refreshes were failing with server/proxy couldn't be found, so I was tracking that down believing it to be related.\n Resolution: I was in the office for the first time in awhile and went to one of our employees reporting this issue as well. I noticed his CPU fan was running non stop, and that really irritates me, so I found the service consuming it which ended up being part of the Dell Optimizer suite. This is \"Intelligent AI-based features automatically fine-tune your PC for the best possible connection, audio and performance.\" NOPE, it sure isn't.\n Dell has a feature called \"Express Connect\" which seems to try and do some QoS style shaping but in real world simply causes nothing but issues. After uninstalling Dell Optimizer and its service (you need to do both) these issues have disappeared.\n TL;DR: Dell Optimizer does nothing to optimize and in fact causes issues that you'll be pulling your hair out on for awhile. Uninstall it and its service.\n ​\n Edit: After KNOWING the issue was Dell Optimizer I am able to locate countless reddit posts about the issue. I almost feel like we need some sort of KB of known trash. We don't reimage these because they are Intune/Autopilot machines going to random sites. \n    submitted by    /u/ydidipickthisdumname  \n [link]   [comments]",

I write them infrequent enough to not be able to visualise a few jobs at a time in my head.\n CronTool has been built together with the Reddit r/programmer community and it got a few novel features that (to my knowledge) you can't find anywhere else. To start, there's a view that allows you to visualise multiple cron jobs - or if you wish: your entire crontab file on a calendar!\n Many of the common crons need 2 or more cron jobs defined, for example:\n Run a cron at two different set times. e.g. I want a cron to run twice daily, at 8:30am and 11:30pm:\n 30 8 * * * 30 23 * * * \n (link)\n Run a cron every 15 minutes throughout the day except at 3AM:\n */15 0-2,4-23 * * * 15-45/15 3 * * * \n (link)\n There is finally a good way to have an overview other those and I hope you'll find this useful too.\n Compared to existing online cron job editor, there are a few things this one can do:\n  \n✅ (obviously) calendar view\n ✅ support for L, W & LW values\n ✅ optional support for seconds & years\n ✅ support for the ? value\n ✅ support for the # value\n ✅ more help & documentation for first timers. Q/A with examples that need multiple crons, for example this one\n ✅ support for debugging multiple crons at once (see above)\n  \nThanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/mindrudan  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have hybrid azure with on-prem ad, laptops are not yet Intune enrolled but are azure ad joined. Windows hello tested and it works. Also company don't want to \"force\" user to use personnal phone (app/number) so we plan to use TAP when users don't want to.\n We planned to help user enable windows hello using TAP/sms/app. Conditional access wil not ask for MFA when on premise (by ip) so it would be only when accessing cloud apps from home.\n But when i test it with windows hello enabled, when challenged for mfa, i can't chose windows hello as a method, Microsoft asks for me to register a MFA method (and redirect me to only authenticator app which annoys me since users can't chose SMS if they want)\n Any idea or best practice on how to achieve that ?

          "description": "I had my first real life encounter with the 2038 bug this week. The situation was caused by a program we have that queries a domain registration API based on expiration date ranges. I had set it to query up to 15 years in the future (even though I know domains can only be registered up to 10 years in the future ... I wrote this thing 20 years ago so I don't remember why I added the extra 5).\n Anyway, 15 years from Jan 23, 2023 (calculated naively as 15 * 365) is Jan 19, 2038. So starting yesterday my query was breaking the API (internal error). The owners of the API identified the problem pretty quickly and confirmed it's the 2038 problem. I changed to query only 10 years in the future and they've now got 5 years to fix it\n I suspect we'll start seeing more of these random discoveries every January, with spikes in 2028 and 2033. Hopefully I'm right in thinking most of the problem code will just get naturally replaced in the next 15 years, but I know I've got a couple of old databases in production that will have to be fixed before then.\n    submitted by    /u/abqcheeks  \n [link]   [comments]",

But no I ended up locking them out.\n In my attempt to recover their files I realized that the BitLockercker key was never stored in Azure or their Microsoft \"My Account\" Page. \n That's when it settled in that I really fucked up.\n My only option was to nuke their computer and hope they had backed up everything to Google Drive or OneDrive. But low and behold they didn't. It's company policy for them to store all their files in google drive and not store any files locally. Still I feel that I really fucked up and I spent 6 hours trying to recover their files and ended up nuking their machine.\n But lesson learned. Don't run dangerous commands on a users machine, and make sure all their files are saved in the cloud if I do have to run dangerous commands.\n I really hope I don't get fired. But I am submitting an Incident report tomorrow morning to the CEO, Co-Founder, and VP (users boss). Let's hope I don't get fucked too bad.

Both computers have a crossover cable connecting them with static IP addresses set, so offline and airgapped.\n The customer reached out to me because their HP LaserJet 1160 was having problems and they couldn't get anyone to work on it. They wanted a printer to replace it with, but wanted one with an LPT port. Long story short, I couldn't find any of those handy, but was able to get things working with a USB printer. Enter the Brother HL-L2300D. A USB-only printer that still has Windows XP drivers listed on Brother's website.\n Plug that guy in, install the drivers, share it, and then run\n  \nnet use lpt2: \"\\hostname\\BrotherP\" /persistent:yes\n  \nThen I went into the DOS program and pointed print jobs to LPT2 instead of LPT1. Had to change the print processor from RAW to TEXT to get it printing, but print it did!\n It's not every day I get to work on something this old, and normally I just say \"nah\" to unsupported stuff like this.

Two Windows 2012r2 servers are connected to it forming a failover cluster for a file server role. This has been fine for years, but now the role fails to bring the volume online due to a 'thread exit or application request'. I believe this is actually timing out:\n Having removed the disk from the cluster entirely, if I try to bring it online on one of the hosts directly, it takes a long time - 30 minutes+ while disk management is locked up. But you can see constant data being read on the iscsi interfaces before it randomly mounts. The data continues to be read but at this point you can browse the data etc. It's like it's scanning the entire content of the volume. \n I can't figure out why this has started happening - it's the same on both hosts, plus another unrelated server I've mounted it on. I guess the issue is the volume, but once it's mounted everything seems okay with the data, and other volumes on other servers from the same MS3600i are cracking on with life. \n Any ideas appreciated - I am perplexed.\n    submitted by    /u/NickTheSloth  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm using a third party BT Stick that works for all other peripherals I connect perfectly fine and did so for the mouse too - just to clarify it shouldnt be the stick imo. \n ​\n The issue is the following: \n ​\n Sometimes (I cant reproduce) the cursor freezes and I cant use the mouse anymore. Mouse is fully charged. To get the cursor moving again I need to either open - if it isnt already - the Bluetooth settings of Windows or if it is already open close it. This seems to reset a driver or wake a suspended driver or device. All movement and clicks the physical mouse performed while it wasnt working in Windows will then be carried out as if queued for later execution. \n ​\n I cant find an option to disable energy saving and this just started a few weeks ago. Unfortunately I do not recall if it started after an update.\n ​\n ​\n Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/Hoppse88  \n [link]   [comments]",

When authenticating to this target, Kerberos will use the DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes registry value on the authenticating DC to determinte supported etypes. If the registry value is not configured, the default value is 0x27, which means 'use AES for session keys and RC4 for ticket encryption' - If this target server does not support AES, you must set msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes to 4 on this object so that only RC4 is used. (Please consider working with your vendor to upgrade or configure this server to support AES. Using RC4 is not recommended) - If this target server does not support RC4, or you have disabled RC4 on DCs, please set DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes on DCs to 0x18 or msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes on this object to 0x18 to specify that AES must be used.

          "description": "Hey everyone, \n i just wanted to know what are the best practices for setting up a windows 10 image or .wim file and deploying that as efficient as possible for a small business of 25 users and little ressources. Im just asking because I'm curious if there are other better ways. I came from a company which had 3000 Users and we used Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager for creating images and deploying them to specific PCs over ethernet.\n Right now at my new company this is not an option as it would be completely overkill for a small business and cost way too much. What I did instead is set up a virtual machine with windows 10 on my local computer, configure some local policies, install some software and create an image which I then deploy by using usb-sticks and using sample scripts from microsoft for formatting and applying the image. But is this really the best method? What I have to do for every PC after applying the image is updating everything, doing a domain or adding missing drivers which drives me nuts sometimes because sometimes the PC has network problems because of missing drivers, which I then have to add manually. \n What I liked about Endpoint Configuration Manager was that you could automate all of these things. Drivers could be added to the task sequence and where loaded from a specific server which the PC connected to while applying the task sequence. Domain join and updates etc. where also all done while applying task sequence. What was left to do for the admin was just to check if everything worked after the PC finished and most of the time, it worked. Is there any similar, cheaper technology or method which can reach the same level of automation?\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable_Onion318  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, I am currently working on an RDS environment for a client and ran into a bit of a snag. \n The short version is that the server broker for two RDSs running Win Server 2022 no longer want to load balance people to the second RDS. When disabling additional sign ins for RDS1, users get an error saying that there are no more servers within the server pool. I will note that previous to the issue I will get into, it worked otherwise. \n The context to all of this is that while working on RDS2 I accidentally installed a broker on the RDS. After it was installed, I uninstalled it but afterward the RDS licenses were not working. After getting it paired back up with the licensing server RDS2 appeared fine but the broker refuses to load balance to it. \n As of now, RDS2 can be RDP'd into directly via IP and there is no issue. While going through the broker though it places all users on RDS1. I previously tested it by signing in multiple users and I got as far as 10 users on RDS1 before I stopped. It just appears that something broke within the broker itself but I have no idea where to start. \n I am very new to the sysadmin world and I have tried literally everything I could research. Are there any additional ideas I should try?\n    submitted by    /u/SirReginaldTheIII  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do we have to rebuild the DC with newer kit after only 7 months just to attain compliance?\n ​\n EDIT: Worth noting our DC is where our VPN is hosted - as well as all of our core servers.

The main difference between departments at locations is their shared folder mappings and printers, which can be managed by groups instead of OUs. My main concern is that due to the frequent staff rotation, persons are going to have to be moved to the new location OU and be added to their respective department groups every few months to receive their location and department specific GPOs.

Well apparently they liked my resume, and I interviewed well enough, that they offered me the position! My feelings of elation and optimism were quickly replaced with dread, \"what if I completely bomb it\"?\n My last job was basically me working tickets from helpdesk and SOMETIMES using RDP to connect to servers to restart services, and perform various minor tasks. It suddenly dawned on me that I actually have pretty much no experience Administrating Systems! Cool! This is the most I've ever been paid, and it's a great IT position in an area where these jobs are few and far between (20 minutes from a small suburb in West Virginia, yay I live in the middle of nowhere). \n Can some of you guys give me some encouragement?

Because the family member who started it was allergic to the optics of nepotism, I wasn't an employee, but rather encouraged to start my own business. Background: I hate Windows. My training, experience, expertise and history is in *nix servers, but my family had a business and needed IT help, so I helped. And what started as remotely helping make choices and advising a local technician (who would reformat a Dell PC with a legit license with pirated Windows because it had the settings he liked) resulted in a nearly twenty year stint as a \"consultant.\" I even moved all the way across the country to help. At first, the family business was too small for a full-time IT Guy, so I wasn't hurt when I wasn't hired on ... I just found other clients. But of course the demands and the work expanded to fill the available time - even though the contract didn't keep pace.\n Anyway, I never wanted to be a Windows admin. I never wanted to do this for a career, and finally - as of today - I'm done. \n Next week, I start a job doing what I used to love doing - we'll see if I still like it - but for now, it's a real relief to be done with email problems, Microsoft licensing, and fucking printers.

A bit more autonomy and less red tape for approvals. The biggest thing I will have two desktop support people under me, our existing one at another site, and I will be able to hire my own desktop support to assist me at my site, which will be GREAT since I am the solo on site IT for our site which is also our corporate HQ. This is a big step up resume having experience with reports and having a manager title... something good to look forward to! \n 25% raise right off the bat. 38%-44% if you factor in bonuses being written into my contract. \n Thank you again.\n    submitted by    /u/woodburyman  \n [link]   [comments]",

Such as resetting the router, Uninstalling and reinstalling Office 365, updating Office 365, Signing out and signing back in, Disabling Zscaler.\n I've ruled out Zscaler as the problem as I've ran a computer without it for 24 hours and still nothing happened.\n ​\n Thanks for any advice and help.\n UPDATE: With Microsoft support help I was able to restore a few people's functionality. We used the restore Outlook cmd.\n Run in administrator mode:\n DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth\n sfc /scannow\n I still have a handful who are not able to use the application still even with this.\n    submitted by    /u/Det_23324  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are migrating an on premise Exchange 2016 server to exchange online, using CodeTwo Exchange Migration. I am assuming since this isn't hybrid, we can gracefully uninstall Exchange server and remove it from Active Directory.\n However the catch is that we will be setting up Azure AD sync soon after. This primarily to setup MFA on the RD Gateway, using the NPS extension. I've set this up before successfully with an existing tenant, matching local AD UPNs to exchange online mailboxes. In that scenario though, a local exchange server never existed.\n Long story long, can I perform the exchange cutover using 3rd party tools, decommission the exchange server; then setup Azure AD connect? Could there be issues with managing the mailboxes in exchange online once Azure AD sync is setup, even though we were not in a true hybrid Scenario?\n Please let me know what you all think, and if I need to clarify any details.

Now that I have, I want to free myself from both Rackspace and Microsoft altogether.\n I have numerous reasons for not wanting to stay with Microsoft which I won't get into as it's not really relevant. My issue is more of a technical one.\n So, I'm planning to migrate to a regular IMAP provider and have been able to enable IMAP for my M365 account, but with MS disabling basic auth I can't use imapsync to migrate the email due to it having issues with OAuth.\n I'm not above setting up a local IMAP server and converting my PST file(s) to Maildir if that's what it takes, but I'd rather find something that will just copy everything across and not require any user intervention.\n So I guess my question is whether anyone knows of something that will allow me to do this.\n Powershell script, bash script, installable applications, anything that works and which is NOT \"Copy everything across manually\".\n I run Linux at home and Windows at work, and I'm ideally looking for something fully functional and free. I'm not against paying for software, it just feels like a waste paying for a license for a program I will use once, as this will be a one-time thing.\n    submitted by    /u/rainformpurple  \n [link]   [comments]",

The message was completely recompiled (I know the sending tool and the original MIME encoding was completely different). I want to help the sender to identify the bad device and wonder if it is possible to identify the vendor of the gateway by the used MIME boundary?\n This are the used boundaries:\n boundary=\"----=_NextPart_000_7D6C_01D92C30.D0148B80\"\n boundary=\"----=_NextPart_001_7D6D_01D92C30.D014B290\"\n Sadly, the header does not give me any hint about the gateway because I do not see anything in the received fields except the last outgoing IP. This device seems to also remove anything previous.\n Due to a google search, I think it may be a Checkpoint firewall, but is there some experience about such headers?\n    submitted by    /u/Kukulkan73  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve been with this same company for 12yrs and I have seen a lot of changes over the years of my employment there. When I first joined it was a non-public company, my previous boss was great, I had time to research on certain projects, put in extra time (not because I had to but I wanted to). Within the years of employment, I’ve seen the company become Public, I’ve been promoted several times, made a name for myself (all the execs know me) and now a manager leading two different teams. However, I feel that it has become more stressful. For me personally I’ve also had things change over the years, I got married back in 2020 to my best friend and we now have a newborn (Baby Girl). I just returned back to work last week and I’m currently struggling on getting back into the groove of things. I’m use to sometimes staying late just to catch up on some work or go in on the weekends to help with maintenance that I can’t necessarily do during the week. You might be asking, why am I doing this…? Because of staffing issues. Yes, I lead two teams but they are a small team and most of them have just started within last year. At this moment, I feel like I’m slowing down and I cannot possibly stay late anymore nor work on the weekends as I use to. My fear is loosing my job due to performance as there are a lot of projects but I feel like staffing is an issue.

          "description": "Our company uses SaaS software since we're primarily remote work, before I joined there wasn't any process in place to check to see if the vendors we utilized actually protected our data. Now part of our software vendor vetting/onboarding practice involves getting either a copy of a SOC2/ISO27001 audit report or having them fill out a vendor security questionnaire so we can get a good idea on their data handling processes. I'm going through our backlog of vendors and requesting these of them so I know where we stand risk wise.\n Every vendor I've reached out to has supplied a SOC2 Type 2 or ISO audit report after throwing an NDA my way. However in a first, I've gotten this email back from a certain collaborative tool vendor.\n  \nHey /u/by_frozenriver, Thank you for reaching out and addressing your request!\n SOC 2 report can only be shared under NDA (which is signed with Enterprise customers), so please let us know if you’d like to evaluate it for your company, and we will gladly pass your request to our Sales team.\n We're glad to inform you that the option to download a SOC 3 report is available on our website. We'd like to point out that diagrams in SOC 3 report are publicly available as a preview, the actual files in high resolution fall under the Security review that we conduct for Enterprise customers only. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused here, but as per our internal Security Policy it is not possible to share the docs in question with non-Enterprise customers and that is not something the Support team is allowed to share at all as we do not conduct Security reviews.\n  \nI've reached out to them to see if they'd fill our security questionnaire in that case. But still, what a weird practice. Pay for the product (on it's highest tier) and then we'll show you that it's safe?\n Definitely going to be looking into alternatives before this annual commitment is up.\n    submitted by    /u/by_frozenriver  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm especially interested in feedback from this crowd since I imagine many of you have pushed out large scale distributions of thunderbolt docks - possibly varying models and brands.\n I dipped my toe into the waters of thunderbolt starting 4-5 years ago with the Dell WD19. I only got around 10 of them in place, but every single one of them would periodically stop recognizing that they had an ethernet connection until the user unplugged and replugged the dock and then rebooted their laptop.\n Then around 3 years ago I rolled out about 50 Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Gen 2 docks with matching X1 Carbon laptops. It seemed like around 50% of those docks ALSO had similar issues, dropping ethernet occasionally, as well as USB devices no longer being recognized, and HDMI outputs dropping their signal. Again, easily resolved with a reboot of the laptop and maybe a power cycle of the dock... but frustrating my users. Since then the reliability rate seems to be much improved... about 90% of those docks are fully reliable now running on Lenovo's latest 3.1.81 firmware plus Intel's latest thunderbolt drivers/firmware. Though oddly, the remaining 10% are unreliable despite all of those same updates.\n And so I've moved on to replacing those remaining 10%, and have mostly been replacing them with the Caldigit TS4... which is obscenely expensive. But (knock on wood) so far with a limited roll out, I've yet to have any user call me about an issue once the initial setup and firmware update was done.\n    submitted by    /u/Threxx  \n [link]   [comments]",

After three weeks that I felt like I was failing constantly, not being able to focus on the important tasks and being overwhelmed with the sheer tasks to do, my boss is finally coming back on Monday. \n That said, I attended company dinner today. Before the meal, the CEO and the higher ups thanked the whole staff for the successful last year. The junior CEO started with some basic things and then suddenly goes: \" and we got a letter in our complaint box. I want to read it to you\". For those who don't know what a complaint box is, it's a box where you can file complaints anonymously. I was shocked when the Junior read the message out loud and the first thing she said was my name. My whole body tensed up. Then she continues \"I want to thank you for your help. You are always kind and you solve all my problems. I whish the company would give him a extra reward\"\n I was not expecting that at all. It never happened to me before. It gets even more surreal. As the clapping the toned down, service department leader stood up and said: \"On that note, i want to add that he is alone at the moment and has a shit ton of work but he even worked late yesterday because I needed him to set up something for me\"\n This feels so great. Some people actually do care for and notice the effort I put into my work. I think this will be forever engraved in my memories. Has anyone of you similar experiences? Does that happen a lot? It really does make a difference if you get praise from people around especially on days I fell like I suck hard.

Our endpoints are AD joined and get a computer cert from AD CA.\n Testing an 802.1x Wireless Profile with Clearpass. If I use EAP-TLS, I can see that the device cert is used for authentication in Clearpass and the client gets connected.\n If I use PEAP, the client doesn't complete the process and I think this must be a cert issue, but having trouble figuring out what it could be.

I mean, after a spate of therapy and treatment for depression and anxiety, I've been referred on for ADHD assessment. I've just set the ball rolling on that now, because ... well, I know self diagnosis is something of a dubious thing, but over 20 years in the profession I'm increasingly believing that \"this is me\". \n But I've fallen into an ecological niche in the business world that suits my brain. \n Because my 'coping strategies' are also ... genuinely beneficial for a 'sysadmin' role. Being great at analysis and problem solving helps me cope with really poor memory retention. I often can't remember things from the previous day, let alone week, but ... that's ok, because I can get to the same place and continue quite rapidly. Working off tickets means my retention doesn't matter. Hyperfocus on something that interests me is amazingly useful when it comes to understanding how all the pieces of a complex system mesh together. etc.\n There's also some things I just know I can't do though, and I avoid those.\n https://www.ted.com/talks/jessica_mccabe_this_is_what_it_s_really_like_to_live_with_adhd_jan_2017\n The standard ADHD screening questionaire is this one: \n https://add.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/adhd-questionnaire-ASRS111.pdf\n    submitted by    /u/sobrique  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have a customer who has 20+ of our systems and the HMIs are Rockwell PanelView Plus 7 Performance Series A terminals that run Windows CE 6.0. Due to Windows CE 6.0 being obsolete, Rockwell has phased out Series A and introduced Series B terminals that run Windows 10 IoT Core. Now, with series B terminals- IPP printers are supported.\n At the completion of each product run, a report is generated on the HMI and a screen capture print is sent to the printers via network. It has become extremely difficult to find a modern printer that is still compatible with the drivers available on Windows CE 6.0. With the introduction of the Series B terminals, our customer now needs to maintain multiple printers- ones for the old Series A terminals and ones for the new Series B terminals.\n Is there a print server solution available that would emulate older printers that the Series A terminals can send their print job to via network using an existing Windows CE 6.0 printer driver, then convert and re-transmit the print job to a modern printer (IPP)?\n    submitted by    /u/Dustball_  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, with very little Googling, I just used a grep/awk/sort/uniq/grep -Ev combo to search a DNS server log, only output a few of the most relevant columns, and remove as much clutter as possible. Here's the sanitized version for those who are curious:\n  grep 192.168.2O4.263 /var/log/server.log | awk '{print $4,$5,$6}' | sort | uniq | grep -Ev 'google|gstatic|cloudflare|stripe|wpengine|youtube|doubleclick|instagram|facebook|twitter|tiktok|fontawesome|in.gov|live.com|ytimg|zdassets|zendesk|bing|skype|microsoft|office.net|office.com|msedge|office365|windows.net|azure' \n It was pretty fun to chip away at the rock to find the gems hidden beneath.\n Oh, man!

In short im taking a 08R2-DC migrating to a Esxi 6.7 hosted WS2016 VM where i would like a \"fresh start\" on rearranging the older AD. \n ​\n I currently have an active AD/Forest that im preparing for a migration over to Microsoft Server 2016, im in the process of cleaning up old objects and folders but im running into issues deleting items that haven't been active or used in quite some time. Im getting a \"you do not have the sufficient privileges to delete \"intern 15-16\" or this is protected from accidental deletion - yet im currently using the domain/sysadmin account.\n This AD has seen several owners prior to my hire 5+ years ago and im trying to strip the AD down to everything minimal in the sense of active users, computers and basic object folder - not extra clutter. I feel getting the AD somewhat back to a fresh start would be easier in the long run, all the permissions and groups need to be revisited as there are groups for folders that a \"S\" would appear in what used to be a user - it annoys me.\n If i can confirm these arent marked for \"accidental deletion\" is there a way to remove them or even set back to default an AD object tree? I dont know if i can afford to create a new AD on the WS2016 or if its possible to migrate only specific workstations or users from the older DC. \n ​\n I do plan on rebuilding all the file folders on the File Server with correct permissions moving forward but im trying to leave as much of the old infrastructure behind as i can without having to migrate over a potential issue. \n ​\n ​\n TLDR; is there a effective way to cleanup old AD DS permissions and broken paths in AD to prepare for a Migration to WS2016 smoothly?\n    submitted by    /u/travvy13  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently I am working a lot with AWS and Azure technologies alongside my Windows experience. I have been messing with some Raspberry Pi devices at home (Pihole/Retropie) for a while and got it into my head to learn Linux to go alongside my Windows knowledge. I have been learning it in my downtime off and on for a while and had been enjoying it. \n Recently we got a client who was using Linux and I was wanting to get more involved. I threw myself into the learning and last week I gained my CompTIA Linux+ certification. During this I realised that really enjoy working with the Linux OS. I am now getting involved with more Linux stuff at work and want to keep going on this side of things. I started thinking about what else is good from a corporate perspective for Linux qualifications. My current thoughts are Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator into Red Hat Certified Systems Engineer, but I don't know if there are other/better options than this?\n Thought I would ask you knowledgeable lot to see what opinions you can offer…\n    submitted by    /u/NecropolisTD  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have had multiple users report that our IT service desk webpage keeps opening itself randomly. \n This morning, I went to see a user and do some digging. In front of me she started typing an email, pressed shift+A and the IT helpdesk web page opened. She closed it, and then went back to her email and pressed shift+A and the helpdesk did not open. Each user reporting the issue says the same thing. There is no consistency as to when it does it or what key combination causes it. \n I have searched the registry for the domain of the helpdesk without the https:// or trailing slashes and nothing came up.\n I have checked all desktop shortcuts for keyboard shortcuts on the helpdesk shortcut, but the user did not even have any shortcuts to the helpdesk in their profile anywhere. \n The user I was with went off on the ward to sort some bits out whilst I dug into the issue, and I asked the other user in the room if they had the same and they said they have had it happen randomly to. It happens on different computers and it does not matter if they use the ward generic account or their account, it happens either way. \n ​\n Has anyone come across this or got any ideas as to where else I can have a look? The bit that has thrown me off is the keyboard combination that triggers it is not static. I am sure I have had this happen to myself as well.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/fusrohdann  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I am a one-man IT department that handles the assets of a small scientific supply company (~30 employees), owned jointly by four different people. I've been doing fine on my own, but recently, the company hired a new warehouse and shipping specialist to handle shipping and receiving packages as well as to keep track of inventory for the whole company. \n In about three months, this person has engineered a situation where now the company is dependent on her to run the business: every time we need the get the materials to build the stuff we make, we need to go through her to get it. She did it under the guise of improving company operations and keeping better track of inventory, however, I strongly suspect she is far more interested in gaining control and power within the company. I am extremely creeped out by her. \n Now she's is targeting my department. She has been demanding that I hand over my inventory of computers, servers, networking equipment, etc. I think she wants to engineer the same scenario with me, where if I want to deploy a new computer/server, I have to go through her first. So far I've resisted these demands, mainly due to security, as I don't want the information of our sensitive IT infrastructure to fall in the wrong hands. But the other main reason is that I'm just flat out creeped out by this person. \n I've been with the company for longer than she has, and I have enough clout with two of the owners who are siding with me. Two of the owners are siding with her. This is a very interesting dilemma I'm finding myself in, and I wanted to ask my fellow sysadmins on what are your thoughts? Is it customary for non-IT people to manage IT inventory? Should I fight this?\n    submitted by    /u/PineappleGardener  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello fellow sysadmins. I work for an MSP subcontracted to a customer and I'm struggling to find a solution to managing access for the guest wireless.\n The customer have a Wi-Fi network set up for guest use using Meraki NAT so it doesn't touch the LAN.\n Previously they had a preshared key that was given out to guests who came to their office. This worked for a while until people started complaining it was mega slow. I log on to Meraki cloud manager and find there was more than 100 devices connected to this SSID. This network is also speed and bandwidth limited to preserve resources for LAN traffic on the APs. It looks like people had been using the PSK to add their own personal devices to the guest wireless thereby slowing it down.\n Before Christmas, the password was changed and it was decided it it was only visible to IT staff who enter it into guest devices when they arrive, but this is far from ideal for a number of reasons.\n I have also suggested changing the password every month and only giving the password to the receptionist who then gives it to the guest. But there are concerns from management the receptionist will just give it out to anyone and we are back where we were before.\n I did look at the Meraki sponsorship option for the guest wireless but this has no reporting feature and no way to authorise specific people who can be sponsors. Again, this is a problem because people will just start authorising their own devices, with no way of seeing who is doing this.\n All the APs are various Cisco Meraki models.\n How are you guys managing guest wireless in your workplaces?\n    submitted by    /u/Psjthekid  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some other applications that share significance or that rely on the internet connection also can't update or work online while some can. There were couple of weird things that left me puzzled, I tried to get on google chrome, while it let me access the internet, could download stuff on it, However, when I tried to get on Mozila or other indie browsers i ended up with \"No Internet\" error. When I used Jdownloader for example on google drive I couldn't access it but when I used bittorrent I could download stuff from it. So through trial-and-error approach my leads were to try and stop dns client via group policy which was impossible because I couldn't even click on the stop or pause button. I also attempted to flash ipconfig via cmd, renew it as well but it didn't work. What else I tried was to controlset1 and change its value to 0 in the regedit, I also attempted to manually enter the proxy 8.8.8.8 ip in the internet settings, none of it worked. So I'm truly hoping that I won't need to reboot my pc fully once again.

And I have some disks failing with different RAID configurations so I have the following questions if someone can help with them please. \n  \nI have a RAID0 disk that I boot esxi from and I'm scared to lose that disk (like I lost another boot disk). I realise now that I should have at least specified RAID1 so I'm planning to do that but I need advice on the best way to go about this. The current boot disk is a HDD and I'd like to move to SSDs. How would I just failover to the new RAID1 configuration without issues? Thankfully I have empty bays where I can plug the new disks in for this server so hopefully this is not too difficult? \n I also have a RAID5 configuration on a different server where I've exhausted all the storage bays and one of the disks failed. Now, the problem is that all these disks are HDDs. I know that I cannot setup an array of HDD & SSD in one so how do I go about replacing these?

I've had about 20 different domains offering various \"investment advice\" and each has a barebones website, so far I've had The Daily Recap, SMHNews, Manhatten Winner, Jeff Clark, Market Minute, etc etc etc... if I even touch the unsubscribe button we get 4 more of these emailing the user.\n So far I've been trying to find commonalities between the emails but they all use large providers and change their wording just slightly (ie \"This ad is sent by...\" to \"This opportunity is sent by...\")\n I've got some pretty aggressive regex which catches 90-100% of it most of the time but then come the wave of new \"providers\". I hard bounce in the hope Amazon/Sendgrid/etc will shut these accounts down but to no avail, I think they have created 99% of their own accounts so a 1% bounce rate doesn't affect them?\n    submitted by    /u/coffeeisnotlatte  \n [link]   [comments]",

We do use Okta for SSO and Identity, which in theory could work with password writeback but it's still a bit cludgy as the local computer must sync with the domain while connected via VPN, meaning an account re-login.\n (Under normal circumstances this would be a non-issue, but I wouldn't be making this post if it was)\n The very minimum I've got working as a happy medium is to enable Windows Hello PIN logon for their local machine, but that doesn't help when it comes to their corporate AD account and any screen/menu where a password cannot be easily entered.\n    submitted by    /u/Radiant_Fondant_4097  \n [link]   [comments]",

We access the environment via AWS user VPN which then traverses a site-to-site VPN to the environment. We considered using AWS Workspaces for this, however it does not play well with our external IDP. This has us back to the drawing board on solutions.\n First, I'm curious if anyone has personal experience with this using AWS AppStream and what up/down sides came with that. What I am unclear about is if I can use AppStream to connect to a Jupyter or Datalore instance running on-prem across the S2S tunnel or will it only work with SageMaker in the AWS VPC?\n Second, I'm open to any other solutions. What was attractive about VDI and AppStream is that we can control copy/paste and file transfer. But, with workspaces and our current IDP we can't get MFA enforcement working.\n Thanks in advance for any help.

Instead of spending a few thousand dollars on upgrading the aging hardware I'm considering migrating them to Azure AD / Intune as they have mentioned moving to the cloud. This could be beneficial from a management perspective as well as no hardware costs and potential hardware failures.\n Their current setup:\n  \nDomain Controller - Windows Server 2016 \n Used for very basic AD functions and DNS (DNS would be migrated to the Fortigate). Pretty much just used for creating users and authenticating them to the domain, no complex policies or in depth configurations.\n \n File Server - Windows 10 machine\n Microsoft 365 Business Standard licenses - Outlook & Office apps\n  \nI am unsure of the best practices when it comes to migrating everything over smoothly. The client heavily uses AutoCAD & Revvit and stores all of their files on the file server, so its unlikely file storage would be moving to the cloud but I would likely upgrade the file server or replace it with a NAS. They use Fortigate VPN to occasionally reach the file server from home to access these files. Will I run into any issues if we keep the local file server and move them to the cloud?\n Would you recommend migrating this client to the cloud and if so what would be my best course of action? From what I've gathered it sounds like a fairly simple process, upgrading the Microsoft 365 licenses to Business Premium, setting up AAD, Intune and Autopilot, either saving their profiles with Profwiz or wiping their devices, joining to AAD and letting autopilot do the work.

It's 5k more than my current base salary. I am still reviewing the other benefits, but the allure of the institution is a big big draw. There is also the potential for significant career growth.\n On the other end, I feel personally indebted to my current boss for various personal reasons; he's the reason I have the job I do currently.

          "description": "I'll make this quick. I'm sure most of us are aware of the Microsoft ASR shortcuts missing problem today, even if you were not impacted. I woke up this morning like any other morning and while scrolling through Reddit in bed, I saw the first few posts of the problem being reported. That sure was a wake up call. \n Thanks to the OPs, commenters with solutions, and others chatting, I was able to \"fix\" and reduce the impact of the problem before everybody starting showing up. My org has tens of thousands of devices and employees. This problem would have been a nightmare to handle. Thankfully, because of those posts and comments, I was able to stay 2-3 hours head of Microsoft's response, which saved us. It's very rare, but we were able to set up full resolutions and responses before users started to call us with problems. Overall, we had a few thousand devices impacted, but it only ended up being around 35% or less of our total fleet. Still bad, but it could have been sooo much worse. I know I can't be the only one in this boat.\n Talking with multiple Microsoft employees (Support, fast-track, devs), they asked me to link to the Reddit posts that I quietly brought up when I said it was a global issue. Congrats to those OP's! Your posts have been seen by everyone! It looks like Microsoft is currently working on solutions to help with impacted shortcut files so only time will tell at this point.\n Again, big thank you to everybody, from the OP's to the people leaving comments. Even the lurkers up voting topics. Today is one of those days where I'm thankful that a community like this exists. If you had this problem at your organization, I wish you a speedy recovery. If you didn't, enjoy this time to relax before the next big problem comes through. Cheers.\n    submitted by    /u/AyySorento  \n [link]   [comments]",

After a month of back and forth regarding firmware / BIOS updates required on the servers, and sending numerous AHS logs, and doing a bunch of un-related troubleshooting, the support engineer tells me that they can't do any more and I have to open a case up using the disk shelf's serial number.\n Why couldn't you fucking tell me that at the beginning!! Instead HP support wasted a month of our time. Days between responses on a ticket that is marked as \"Critical Degraded\". Stressed us out over the holiday's causing several of us to have to work over the holiday's to run CHKDSK on the volumes, and worrying that our data might get lost.

It's legit.\n On current revisions of Windows, 10 and 11:\n January 10, 2023—KB5022282 (OS Builds 19042.2486, 19044.2486, and 19045.2486) - Microsoft Support \n There is a vulnerability in WinRE, that if unpatched...\n 🔃 Security Update Guide - Loading - Microsoft \n What kind of security feature could be bypassed by successfully exploiting this vulnerability?\n A successful attacker could bypass the BitLocker Device Encryption feature on the system storage device. An attacker with physical access to the target could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to encrypted data.\n Are there additional steps that I need to take to be protected from this vulnerability?\n Yes. You must apply the applicable Windows security update to your Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). For more information about how to apply the update, see Add an update package to Windows RE.\n Are both offline images and WinRE in a running environment affected by this vulnerability?\n No. Only a WinRE image on a running PC is vulnerable. This can be any time a recovery or reset operation is invoked from the main OS.\n ​\n So:\n 1) JUST the CU doesn't fix it. You have to patch WinRE. Most people won't do this.\n 2) Since the Windows Recovery environment is not encrypted/protected, someone could just 'replace' the WinRE.wim file with an 'old, bad one', and exploit this vulnerability, even if you patched 'your' device.\n Have any organizations/anyone else spoken about this? It seems to have effectively slipped under the radar, and while it would be 'hard' to exploit, maybe, and 'hard' to replace a WinRE environment... it's not THAT hard.\n I'm not saying \"go 3rd party\", by any means, but this seems... bad?

But once it is set it will be correct next time this user logs in.\n So this only happens the first time each user logs in. \n The soundcards are not the same in each classroom so we are not going to take care of this by some group policy.\n I know about the default user profile settings, but the computers are all on domain but with different soundcards between classrooms. So what I am trying to figure out is the best practice if I can log me in on the computer for the first time locally, set the sample rate to correct settings and then every other domain user that logs in after that will get the same settings. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/gasgeir  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Since I started working at my current employer there has been a lot of patching and fixing various security holes. Guy before me was tech savvy but not comfortable with server environments etc, the age old tale. Without going into too much detail, we have a department which does a lot of development. Until recently, all of these employees (approx 15 people) all had local admin rights (users added to AD group, GPO set said group as local admin on all workstations). Obviously we don't want that many admin accounts, even if they only have those privileges on workstations and not servers etc, let alone people who do not work in the IT department. \n As you may have figured out, this caused some outrage among the developers. We are not big enough yet to have a \"functional\" helpdesk and utilize LAPS in an effective way so I'm still walking around approving installs. However, so far that has only happened once since this change was applied. This makes me believe 1. they vastly exaggerate the amount of times they do things that require admin privileges (no surprise) and 2. This is more of a \"hurt ego\" situation where they are more upset over being \"downgraded\" than it is an actual issue. \n Do you think I made the right call or is it overkill? \n TL;DR: Developers lost their admin rights and are upset. I think it is a major security hole to let an entire department have admin rights. I believe they are more upset of having been \"downgraded\" than it actually being a problem, but I'm doubting myself. \n Thank you!\n P.S I am the only one doing IT and we are >100 people in three countries\n    submitted by    /u/simedr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well sometime in the last 30 days, my domain controllers stopped talking to each other. Remote is PDC, other is onsite. They are in separate sites in active directory.

I brought this up with HR and now they are launching an investigation on my Boss. It is worth nothing, that he had 2 people leave this year and I talked to one of the people that had the same experience I am facing. On our call, he said he felt isolated and nitpicked for flaws.

Needs to be able to be only touched by a few individuals who have the credentials to access what is being stored on the NAS and remote VPN into it. 2. NAS company cant be apart of China, Russia, or Middle East related company due to the storage on the device. 3. device will need to have redundancies of course.\n My questions are, should the device be placed on a subnet on the already established network at the HQ? Should a separate network be created that only houses CUI related items to ensure that the storage device can have added security measures that the main network does not implement?\n ​\n Thanks for any help in advance we are heavy in the research phase.\n    submitted by    /u/gangusTM  \n [link]   [comments]",

Eventually, it broke, and because it's deprecated, MS refused to help us fix it (the no IPv4 issue was also a point of contention, but we worked around it). So, we moved to Always on VPN configured to connect to our Sonicwalls. Unfortunately, some users complain of frequent connection drops, and for a significant number of people, the \"Always on\" functionality just isn't there, they have to manually connect it.\n Ideally, we'd like a machine based VPN that connects before login (like DirectAccess), so thinks like SCCM can function without an active user.

          "description": "I think this is the right community for this topic, but if you think there is some other more adeqaute sub reddit, please tell me.\n I am in the process of migrating our Hpe StoreVirtual (LeftHand) VSA cluster to a new (and supported) solution.\n Our HCI infrastructure is a basic two nodes stretched cluster, in a network raid 10 configuration. These two nodes are in two different CEDs rooms, connetcted through a 10GbE fiber cable. LeftHand has proven to be a reliable solution in these 8 years we used it.\n The only (big for me) cons I have toward Hpe is the support policy: if you do not have a valid maintenance contract, no one besides hpe personnel can gain access to the OS in case of problems. I mean the OS of the StoreVirtual virtual machines that \"do the magic\" abstracting the local storages and make them visible to the vmware cluster as a (one or more) vmfs shared datastore(s).\n Our reseller strongly advised us to move to Hpe SimpliVity, because that's the natural step forward basing on our specific topology. SimpliVity too has the (big) limit above: once it will go EOSL you will not be able to gain access to the \"ninja\" console in case of troubles.\n Personally, I gave a look to Vmware vSAN solution and I proposed it as an alternative to my reseller. They discouraged me for the following reasons:\n - VMware vSAN solution is not natively fit for a two nodes stretched cluster. It born for a three nodes cluster, and in order to cover the gap with other vendors, it later adapted the solution to work with two nodes solutions as well.\n - vSAN does not have the \"data locality\" peculiarity. Data blocks for a given virtual machine are written across the nodes, independently from where the vm is located. SimpliVity, as opposite, has this advantage (inherited from StoreVirtual VSA after all).\n Do you agree with this analisys or the reasons cited above are weak and vSAN is in any case a better solution for my cluster topology?\n Thank you,\n Francesco\n    submitted by    /u/bianko80  \n [link]   [comments]",

Other exec's have been promoted from within, so they got their IT orientation when they came on board as manager, rank-and-file staff, etc. This person is new to the organization.\n My usual orientation involves a bit of a discussion on how to get support, how we handle IT assets, where to find important data, important distribution lists and groups in outlook, where to find printers, brief conversation about IT policies (and where to find and agree to them), and so on.\n Specific LOB tools are oriented by other groups - HR does the bit about payroll tools, finance/purchasing does their bit about procurement, and so on.\n It occurred to me that this is probably more finer detail than this person needs or wants. I was thinking that I should probably keep high level - save your data \"here\" (OneDrive), we use Teams as a communication platform, here's how you get support...\n If you're the new executive to a company, and you've got ~30 minutes of an IT orientation, what's the most effective use of that time?\n    submitted by    /u/timatlee  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our laptops are covered by intune anyway and it just so happened we had a catastophic failure and lost our main sccm server. We actually could restore it but we have lost of lot of the licensing for it and dont really need it anymore as we only used it for updates and laptop deployment. So it's only windows updates that is the issue now. I cant seem to recall where I setup the gpo to point to the internal ms server aka sccm. I need to undo this and for now have them all go to the internet until I get wsus setup for servers, I've tried rsop and everything and cant seem to find the right gpo to change this because rsop shows that it is the local policy where this was set. Doesnt the domain policy overwrite local. Do I need to remove ccm etc before it will work. SCCM is a weird beast to undo\n    submitted by    /u/dmcginvt  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then when they drop it in SharePoint you open an Excel doc and all the links are broken. The only way to \"fix\" it is to go into every new Excel workbook and manually update all of the links to point to the source files they put on SharePoint. I cant expect accounting to do this all day, I wouldnt want to either.\n This is a HUGE problem. Accounting has files fractured everywhere and the consultants with all these inter workbook links are making everything a tedious mess.\n What is an appropriate solution to this? I imagine step one is getting the consultants to actually START the workbooks in the same space that we will end up accessing them from, and also keeping the sources there for links. Assuming they will actually listen to that, is SharePoint a workable tool for it?

The eventlog is jam packed with errors, the same as you see in the link below. We have a fix in place that works well, and the user is up and running again, but I am struggling to find the culprit/cause of this. I worry that this will continue with more and more computers coming in to us with the same issue.\n I`ve eliminated windows update as a cause, our antivirus, and we do not have ClickShare installed.\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/880616/start-button-not-responding-outlook-will-not-conne?page=1&orderBy=Newest#answers\n Any ideas or experiences with this issue?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/bardunpower  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello fellow sysadmins.\n We have a certain user in our organization, which of reasons I am not really able to discuss, is in need of a very strict computer policy, mainly in regard to web browsing.\n The user itself has asked for a surveillance solution where they know that every X second a screendump is taken and saved to a location the user itself cannot access, but that the user knows a supervisor both has access too, and frequently browse through. This will effectively prevent the user from doing wrong things on the internet as they know they will be “caught”. \n In addition, we are thinking of installing a VNC-server so the supervisor at any time can connect and remote view the screen. This will pose as an additional “threat” to the user to not do anything they should not be doing.\n Any tips regarding a working web filter would also be appreciated. \n Obviously, we will have a signed contract between the end user, the supervisor, and the company in regard to this deal. We will also make sure local authorities accept our solution as not to violate anyone’s basic rights. But like I said, most of these ideas originated from the user itself, and we believe the legal part of it won’t be an issue.\n Technically we are hoping to run this on a domain-joined desktop with Windows 11.\n In summary:\n 1) Need a software/solution for taking a screenshot every X second and save to a folder inaccessible to the user itself. Other ideas are welcomed. \n 2) Software alternative to VNC in order to being able to remote view a computer at any time without end user interaction.\n 3) Any working webfilter to block certain types of websites.\n 4) Other tips on how to set up a secure and surveillance of a computer in order to make sure the end user knows they cannot perform any foul play even if they are tempted to, or technically able to do so.\n    submitted by    /u/perlebajs  \n [link]   [comments]",

Almost all PCs do have enabled Remote Desktop Connection, which works great. We also have WOL set up, which also works great. During COVID time the need for a work-from-home option has been introduced. So we set up remote access to PC via Remote Desktop Gateway. We also put 2FA on it. Also no problems. Last month our boss told us, that we need to set a policy on all PCs that would put them to sleep (so the company can lower the power consumption and especially the bill for it) after more extended inactivity. So now the problems start.\n Most PCs wake up when you want to connect to them via RDC (either inside a company or from home), but some just do not want to wake up and the RDC window put out an error for failed connection. But the strange part is, that if we send the WOL packet to the same PC it will boot/wake up without a problem. So BIOS and NIC are configured correctly for WOL. Are there any different settings for waking up PC from sleep when there is network activity to it? Did any of you experience similar problems?\n I'm grateful for any answers or suggestions.\n Regards\n    submitted by    /u/neklaf  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm sure you guys have seen the news regarding the weather on the west coast. \n Today we had a power outage and as of this post we are still without power. We are currently powering the crucial servers which host the domain controller vm's etc via a gasoline generator with 240v extension cords lol. \n Needless to say the power outage sparked a big conversation, at work, about the cost of maintaining on prem AD environment. For instance we had to call an electrician to fix an issue with our generator, how often do we need to be testing out the equipment in the case of another power outage, etc.\n We have a hybrid AD env but the most crucial files are hosted on prem. I floated the idea of moving certain files shares to azure so people can work (process invoices) in the event of another outage, among other things.\n As I started looking into replacing AD with Azure AD I came across the this article (mentioned in the title of this post).\n To the more senior sysadmins out there what are your thoughts the article and more importantly it's general sentiment; e.g. Azure AD is not a replacement for on prem AD but rather an enhancement?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Limp-Exercise7734  \n [link]   [comments]",

During a true up/consumption review, they operated in pretty poor faith and bent us over for several hundred thousands per year extra.\n The issue stems from the original scope expanding and OKTA professional services being engaged to do the architecture. This effectively resulted in additional orgs being created that weren't necessary and we had users cross federating between them which created duplication or triplication of users and jacked our consumption up. At no point were we informes we should account for consumption or take additional user life cycling measures.\n As a result we've got 4 months to fix it or piss them into the wind and go to another offering.

Took the computer out of the machine completely dismantled it to get to the hard drive (it’s basically an all-in-one attached to the machine with a swiveling arm and the back of the case is a inch thick aluminum plate which is the heat sink for the pc). Put a new IDE SSD in it, restored the ghost image, and put it back together. \n ‘no hard disk found’\n Grrr. Started to suspect that something more than just the drive was crapped out. \n Got the forces in motion to request lead time and cost for a new (!) computer, which would still have hardware capable of - and running - Win XP (the servos in the machine require specific software which only runs on XP)\n 6-8 weeks. $60k\n ‘Wut’\n Took the computer back off and pulled it apart again. Retraced my steps to see if I missed something. I didn’t. \n Put it back together. \n Back in the machine, I booted the computer again. \n ‘Invalid partition table’. \n Interesting… it sees a hard drive. \n Took it back apart. \n Hard drive back into the ancient laptop we keep around just for this kind of stuff. \n Had to get creative.\n I suspected the MBR to be missing/corrupt. The replacement SSD had smaller capacity than the original spinner. I had to tell our ghosting software to resize the partition, which I think messed it up. \n So I wiped the drive, looked and found a XP Professional dvd, and installed a fresh copy. Once done, I booted the ancient laptop back to the ghosting software, and wiped the partition I just created with Win XP install. \n I then ghosted our backup image back. \n 30 mins later, I had the computer back in the machine and it was time to go for a test run. \n Booted right up, they’re happily running production as we speak.\n    submitted by    /u/rhutanium  \n [link]   [comments]",

But it doesn't meet my needs. I use vmware and, reader should detected from there also, but readers doesn't even seen in device manager, so i can't pass them to vmware.\n I don't want to connect 2 monitors to leptop and use different keyboard mouse set.

I just did out of the box developer config with standard e-mail filtering for the receiving address - which is what any company on O365 is likely to be running.\n What I found was that as long as my display name includes my last name (a 4-letter word with one regional character) Microsoft categorically flags the e-mail as junk. This is regardless if the e-mail comes from my company's domain or from my private domain. As long as the display name includes my last name, it is considered junk by Microsoft. My first name doesn't have any impact.\n If I change the name by replacing or adding a letter, it is no problem, so it is specifically this name that is always flagged as junk.\n So apparently people who have my last name are by default not allowed to send e-mails to companies that use O365 for e-mail. This should affect a few hundred people at least. I already have a support case open and am planning to talk to my contact at Microsoft, but neither of those options have been very useful in the past. Is there more I can do to restore my family's honor with Microsoft?\n And also, who tf uses display name to filter spam? That seem insane.\n I have had users in my company report similar issues in the past but it passed after they changed signatures and such, but for me and my father it seemed like our last name in the display name was the only thing that impacted spam filtering.\n    submitted by    /u/vemundveien  \n [link]   [comments]",

Would be swapping industries from local govt to a private healthcare company.\n First interview went great, nailed it I think. They called me back for a follow up today to meet with the CIO. Also went really well.\n In the course of the discussion I asked about their health coverage. I have a wife and son and we all have medical needs in some capacity. I was given a copy of their benefits handbook for new hires and was told to expect a call within the next day or so.\n Once I was home and settled I took a look at the health coverage and HOLY CRAP!\n Even their lowest tier plan was more than double what I am currently paying through my counties insurance and they are both Florida Blue.\n I thought that it had to be the total before the employer contribution so I reached out to the recruiter and he passed the question along to the companies HR.\n They confirmed that those numbers are the employee share. Their initial offer was 13k more than what I'm making now but would actually be a 7k pay CUT after selecting the plan that provided the coverage we need.\n I countered and told them I would need 5k more than the top advertised range for it not be a total wash. 30 minutes later I got a call saying they could go up to the max, but not above it and I had to politely decline their offer.\n I was honestly shocked at how expensive their coverage was and how little it covered. Maybe it's because I've been in the public sector for the last decade but there is no way I can see paying $1700/mo to cover myself, wife and son just so that mental health visits are included.\n I was also baffled that their mid tier (still 1300/mo) was the same plan number I am currently enrolled in BCBS 5302 but my coverage (PPO) has FULL coverage for counseling and mental health office visits, no co-pay or anything.\n Oh well...\n    submitted by    /u/morilythari  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not going to get into how much of a joke the amount is, how with inflation I'm technically taking a pay-cut for the 3rd year in a row. No, that's been said before. I want to call out this blurb:\n \"To protect your private information, details of your compensation should not be shared with other employees...\"\n It goes on to say that you should contact HR if you have any questions/concerns/etc... about your pay. I have read several articles and forums that suggest we should in fact be talking more openly about our salaries. That would encourage fairness and quality. That would allow job seekers to know what the starting pay is along with how much others in that same position make after a few years of tenure. However, in the real world knowing that Slacker McCoy over there doing 10% of the work gets paid the same as me, and Flipper Jones in the other building makes more than me, would really build some resentment and in turn a hostile work environment. I can see it from both of those points of view.\n Unions are pretty open about their salaries and public (government) jobs are typically a line item on a budget someplace and public information, so you can find that too. Is it because companies need to stay competitive so they keep compensation a tightly guarded secret?\n ​\n EDIT: Good convo so far but leaning heavily on the legality of the request. That wasn't really what I was getting at. I rather like my job and the organization I work for. We have posted pay ranges and grades so I know roughly what most people are making, if I cared to look it up.

Env2 created three years ago. Clean! No errors that I can find.\n Env1 I'm getting persistent errors. If I look back at historical logs, we have had this problem since October 2022 at least (prior to the Nov patch problems).\n In Env1 if I look at the logs in Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy/Operational I don't see any problems at all. No errors in processing for users logging on. In addition, if I execute \"gpupdate\" in the cmd line, it succeeds without problems.\n However if I look at the System log, I see the recurring events every two hours.\n Event ID 40970 The security system has detected a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN LDAP/host1.domain@domain with error code 'The attempted logon is invalid. This is either due to a bad username or authentication information (0xc000006d). Authentication was denied.'\n Event ID 40970 The security system has detected a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN LDAP/host2.domain@domain with error code 'The attempted logon is invalid. This is either due to a bad username or authentication information (0xc000006d). Authentication was denied.'\n Event ID 1030 The processing of group policy failed....\n After rebooting a server, the problem goes away. But randomly, it will begin on a domain server and then persist indefinitely until rebooted. Then on another day, another server is affected the same way. It could be any server that becomes affected. It seems to occur at any random time. No other problems seem to present in the environment. \n The goal though is to remove these errors and to fix whatever issue exists in the domain.\n I'm wondering what the connection is between event ID 40970 and 1030 and where to look for clues here.

Only after the audit is completed, and we propose a contact with them, and they accept, do we go forward with RMM tools.\n ​\n What im looking for is a tool i can use before the later stages of us installing, example, ninjarmm agents on the computers.\n ​\n In short, is there any software (preferably free, but will consider paid as well, depending on the price), that i can arrive on someone's network, plug into their network (or connect wireless), and scan taht subnet, and get all the system info for all devices?

Quality drop because it workers are treated like crap, low pay no benefits etc. And companies also suffer because they get bad services. \n Here's another example comp A outsource to Company B. Company be sends Billy to be there full time and look after then. Billy get paid $20 hour and company B bill company A $100 for Billy... Billy is not happy. Company B suffer too.

          "description": "Started doing IT work last year, and I inherited the last person's backpack. Great to have it but it is enormous on me; he was a big guy. I have narrow shoulders and am short, to boot, so it hangs too low and is pretty uncomfortable walking around wearing it when it is full of 15\" laptop, chargers, cables, misc parts and batteries, etc. I saw this thread on different sub, and the Everiki Atlas looks great except some Amazon comments say it is large for a small person to wear comfortably. Looking at other posts on this sub, I do love Swiss Gear but yeah, too big. Comfort matters more as I age.\n Any small people who have recommendations? Some brands make \"women specific\" packs for narrow shoulders and smaller frames, but these are mostly hiking type backpacks. I like the multi-section approach of a tech specific pack like the Atlas, and since I also want to use it as an under-the-seat backpack for personal travel, I appreciate the extra features of easy access top pocket, sleeve, etc. I may just buy a 11-15\" Atlas and try it, but thought I'd check here first.

When I create a symbolic link to a network share, then navigate to that symbolic link and open any subfolder on that share, the context menu \"New\" option only shows the \"Folder\" option with the UAC logo. See this picture.\n These are the steps to recreate the issue:\n 1. Create a symbolic link on a command prompt: mklink /d d:\\LocalFolder\\ \\\\NAS\\NAS_Folder 2. Navigate to d:\\LocalFolder 3. Open any subfolder inside that symbolic link. 4. Right click/New. You will see only the \"Folder\" option with the UAC shield. \n It's worth noting that if I directly access the \\\\NAS\\NAS_Folder and open any subfolder, the New menu shows all available options and the UAC shield is gone.\n What's going on and how could I prevent that behaviour? Disabling UAC from registry only gets rid of the shield but the context menu still shows just the Folder option.\n PS: I've tried this also on a recently installed Windows VM.

The exposed container is an authentication proxy that validates auth headers before forwarding upstream to the private subnet.\n Is the idea to put the auth proxy container on the host network since host can communicate to all bridge networks? From here, I would put NGINX & all software on a user-defined bridge network to isolate from the public internet but accessible via the auth container on the host network?\n Curious if I'm missing anything with respect to security and isolation.\n Example:\n  \nAuth Proxy: Network mode is host running on port 80 and 443 for plain HTTP and TLS\n \nNGINX: Runs in user defined bridge network, let's say 172.16.0.0/16\n \nApp 1: Runs in same subnet defined above with static IP 172.16.0.5\n \nApp 2: Runs in same subnet defined above with static IP 172.16.0.6\n \n I don't want the public internet to be able to talk to NGINX or App 1 or App 2, but force communication to proxy through auth container bound to host. \n As an additional question, is it true the host can always talk to a container on a user-defined bridge network?

After so many years of system admin experience, I honestly feel kinda silly typing all this out:\n So, I have a webserver at my office where multiple sites are hosted. So there are several domains all pointed to, for example 192.168.1.50. How is the traffic differentiated between domain1.com and domain2.com when IIS receives the traffic?\n If I am setting up a second webserver or troubleshooting dns issues, etc, I am aware that I can edit the hosts file locally to force a computer to resolve a particular domain to a different IP. So, for instance, if I am migrating one webserver to another, I can do preliminary testing by updating the local host file on a test PC. I guess my question is, is it possible to pull specific web pages via IP somehow, and not edit the hosts file?\n More specifically, if I simply browse to 192.168.1.50 I just get an IIS page. What would the syntax of the url be if I am able to pull a specific site by IP? I feel like there is some building block here that I'm missing that keeps me from really understanding what's going on here.\n If my wall of text isn't clear, heres an example scenario:\n Web Server 1 - 192.168.1.50\n DNS a record domain1.com 192.168.1.50\n DNS a record domain2.com 192.168.1.50\n I set up Webserver 2 and perform a migration.\n Webserver 2 192.168.1.51\n no DNS records, but IIS is serving out a copy of domain1.com and domain2.com\n So, I can set the local host file on a network attached PC to point domain1.com & domain2.com to 192.168.1.51 and perform some testing.\n Is it possible to pull domain1.com and domain2.com by IP on 192.168.1.51 without editing the local hosts file?

After that I'll connect the drive and make a 1:1 copy with clonezilla. \n Is it just that easy or did I miss something?\n    submitted by    /u/VariousLawyer4183  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know I have a long way to go experience wise but I am working toward a master's in computer security management followed by Sec+ and Net+. The title at the moment is basically help desk but with the responsibility of a systems administrator, network engineer, and Azure cloud engineer.\n CEO asked me to start thinking about what my next title should be but I don't even know what I want to do in this field. I love IT, love making something work after multiple failed attempts, and the rush of self-accomplishment when the problem is solved. I like working in Azure and Intune, have not tried my hand at coding or scrips because I am not confident in my ability to not blow everything up in the process.\n What I am asking for is just some insight on what a solid next step title would be from helpdesk. I eventually want to become a CISO in the next 8-10 years but just unsure of how to get there.

But when it comes to samba, I have not seen that option; I have to assign each share to a single unit/letter. Is that a samba limitation? Or is it just a Windows limitation?

So I ran 'shutdown immediate' (which hung for a bit and I thought I was screwed) and then started it up and enabled archive mode. Made some changes in the application and everything appears to be working. Whew! To you experienced DBAs, what would have been the downside to leaving archive mode off? Also, is it worth using RMAN for a 20GB database? The application vendor's DBA helped enable it last year when we moved from on-prem to Azure, but I have no idea how to use it if something went wrong.

          "description": "Inspired by the recent post of bombing an interview, for about a thread for the opposite? Mine just happened a couple of weeks ago. I had an overzealous recruiter (in a good way) that checked on me prior to the interview, and promised to call after. Anyhow, the interview is going ok from my standpoint. The questions are really focused on one particular area of expertise, not my strongest but I keep my resume honest and spoke to my knowledge in the area. About 40 minutes inI notice a call from the recruiter come through which of course I send to voice mail. The interview was originally scheduled for a half hour (lol) so I figured she was just being eager to follow up. Anyhow it wraps up about 15 minutes later and I call the recruiter back. She asks me how I thought it went. I said so-so, it wasn't my best interview, but it wasn't a bad one. \n It turns out that she was calling because mid-interview the interviewer had messaged the recruiter to go ahead and prepare an offer letter. I've got to say that's the first time I received an offer before finishing an interview.\n So, what's your interview that you absolutely nailed?\n    submitted by    /u/Fusorfodder  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Goodbye silly contracts saying you can't use your skills in the free market\n ​\n About one in five American workers—approximately 30 million people—are bound by a non-compete clause and are thus restricted from pursuing better employment opportunities. A non-compete clause is a contractual term between an employer and a worker that blocks the worker from working for a competing employer, or starting a competing business, typically within a certain geographic area and period of time after the worker’s employment ends. Because non-compete clauses prevent workers from leaving jobs and decrease competition for workers, they lower wages for both workers who are subject to them as well as workers who are not. Non-compete clauses also prevent new businesses from forming, stifling entrepreneurship,…",

URLs are in Base64 & HEX but passwords ARE NOT. You can confirm this from Mr. Gibson's show notes. They have directions to obtain your vault/blob via a browser - https://www.grc.com/sn/SN-904-Notes.pdf\n LastPass's offsite cloud backup data was exfiltrated. The offsite backup includes backups from their on-premises servers and regional data(required for regions with regulatory reasons)\n You should check your master password iteration counts. If it's 5,000 and you have a short(most likely 8 character password) you might be in pickle. Steve's also explained this and the history of how it came to be in the show notes. Change your master pass immediately to a longer one *and also passwords for individual sites*. Also up the iterations to 350,000.\n If you're an old(started using it circa 2008 - LastPass's start) LastPass user your vault might be a mixture of passwords in CBC & ECB mode. It seems LastPass has left passwords created in CBC \"as is\" when they realized and shifted to *ECB*.\n  \nThey've made mistakes along the way like having several data breaches. Some are forgivable and can be given a pass. But I do agree with Steve that they should have *automatically \"upped\" the iterations on Password Based Key Derivation Functions(PBKDF2) for all clients*, Pestered people to shift to longer master passwords on client UIs and lastly, shifted those old passwords from CBC to ECB.\n https://youtu.be/9XWHCF4pLmI\n ​\n Edits denoted and enclosed with *\n    submitted by    /u/AdrianTeri  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi team,\n ​\n Some help please!!!\n I have been tasked to migrate/consolidate 2 file share server running on Server 2008 to Server 2018. \n ​\n I have spent some time looking at the Microsoft Storage Migration Service tool, it seems that there are three main tasks to perform \n 1) File Share discovery 2) Copy data from old to new server 3) Final cutover, I notice that the Storage Migration Service tool \n  \ndoesn't seem to support consolidating multiple file servers into one\n doesn't seem to allow file share migration in a phrase approach, e.g migrate a smaller number of shares first, test/confirm its all working then move on to the next lot. \n  \nAm I missing something here? I start to wonder if the Storage Migration Service is the right tool for the task?\n Any help would be much appreciated. \n ​\n Thanks,\n Chris\n    submitted by    /u/Apprehensive_Gur_36  \n [link]   [comments]",

They only tell you to use the EEM instead (wich is a really cool feature ngl)\n To top it all of: There's a chance of the master-switch to crash and reboot when you try to get rid of the config line.\n *sigh*\n Hope y'all had a somewhat chill start in this year.

I am able to register it etc into the registry so someone can type in \"coolapp://blah\" in start-> run or by clicking on a link in their favourite browser and it would fire up my app and pass on prams etc.\n Now what I need to do is allow Outlook desktop app to open those links without getting this \"Microsoft Outlook Security Notice - Microsoft Office has identified a potential security concern.\" message.\n I can add the custom url schema key in \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\Security\\Trusted Protocols\\All Applications\" and Outlook won't complain anymore for the current logged user.\n Now when I went to put that same key under \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\Security\\Trusted Protocols\\All Applications\" (and remove the one in HKEY_CU) I am finding that Outlook is not picking up the key under HKEY_LM and starts complaining again.\n Am I trying to do something that is not supported or am I putting it in the wrong place?\n I followed this: https://superuser.com/questions/1365501/office-365-ver-1809-how-do-i-specify-trusted-protocols and it got me 1/2 way there - ideally I would like to set it global and be done with it.\n Running GPRESULT /H GPReport.html brings up nothing and gpupdate /force and rebooting didn't help.\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/Danielx64  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have used both GNS3 and EVE-NG in the past (on my Windows computer with VMware Workstation/VirtualBox and even in the Google Cloud). I have enjoyed them both greatly but at the moment would choose EVE-NG.\n Right now I have a MacBook so virtualisation is not really an option for me since it is Silicon/ARM based. Google Cloud is too expensive for the amount of CPUs and RAM I need for a good lab (>24vCPU and 48RAM, also the resources are not always available in zones which is really frustrating). I could just buy a used bare-metal server for my virtualisation but I am not sure I will have room for it but it is an option I am considering.\n I need the to emulate different vendors so CML is not an option for me as well.\n Could you suggest the most practical and least expensive way to setup a lab?\n What has your experience been with it?

It makes sense to use the Extreme option since we already have other products, but if there is a better solution, I would like to know. I would also like to ask if this would allow us more insight into upstream routing information, as we somewhat regularly have routing issues between our two ISPs (I can add more detail if needed).

For reference this post deals with two separate sites that are unable to communicate with one another (or correctly at least). For simplicity I'm going to refer to them as Site A and Site B and the majority of the IT team including myself works at a different branch from the two.\n I first became aware of the issue when a member of the helpdesk team brought up that Site A can't communicate with Site B. Surface level this appeared to be true as he had run ping tests from the DC at Site A to the gateway at Site B receiving \"Request timed out.\" response. However, Site B can ping Site A without issue... I assumed that this is some sort of blocking issue with one of the FortiGate's since one of the sites can send ICMP echo packets it wouldn't be a routing issue. But I see nothing related to the ping tests shown in the logs on Site A or Site B's FortiGate. I would run a pcap but the deployed models do not have onboard memory unfortunately.\n Then it started to get a bit confusing, I ran a trace route from a VM at Site A to Site B and it completed without issue. The sequence of hops was as follows: Site A VM -> Site A Layer 3 Switch -> Site A FortiGate -> Site B FortiGate -> Site B Layer 3 Switch -> destination IP.\n Out of curiosity I ran a perpetual ping test from Site A to Site B for 10~ minutes and shockingly saw a couple successful ping attempts among all the \"Request timed out.\" responses (98% loss for reference). Site A is also able to communicate with all of our other sites without issue.\n Any advice or tips for this? This one is starting to make my head spin and I feel I may be missing something obvious.\n Edit: Forgot to mention - Site B responds to ping from all of our other sites without issue.\n    submitted by    /u/Happy-Drive9316  \n [link]   [comments]",

Have any professionals here run lines up a shaft? Is this a huge code violation??? Will I be featured in Darwin Awards??\n    submitted by    /u/nojam75  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since then we have migrated to their hybrid drive solution with an expensive ,windows server running the server software and a windows plugin on each computer serving files from the cloud or the server, depending on location. The search path for all files remain the same. A great server solution with hardware costs remainso nothing. Useful and straightforward, in theory.\n In reality: The service is expensive since we have a lot of server data (around 10TB) and the hybrid software makes the work in our CAD software very slow since each work session loads hundreds of files and the hybrid software/server solution becomes incredibly slow. In reality, we need to sync all folders locally even when we are on our LAN with a server.\n As an administrator without any professional knowledge of IT systems, it is near impossible for me to find other alternatives and compare the pricing and functionality. We will need to get out of this as soon as possible.\n Which Egnyte alternative should we look into? \n (Sorry for the low-quality question.)\n    submitted by    /u/Arsehowl  \n [link]   [comments]",

We built a NetMotion Secure Access server on our server VLAN (10.1.4.0), with the intent of having VPN clients reach out to a DHCP server and get an IP from a newly created 10.1.74.0/24 range. However, I'm trying to conceptualize how this would work with regards to routing and our firewalls. A couple of notes:\n  \nNetMotion, as far as I know, has no configurable static routing/VLAN assignment/etc\n In order for clients to get an IP from the desired range, we give the server an IP to use from it (10.1.74.5). The server sends DHCP requests using that address\n  \nWith that said, I suppose my question two-fold:\n  \nHow exactly would that work? If our firewall sees packets from the 10.1.74.0 subnet coming in on the server VLAN, it will block them, correct? Is there a logical way to allow access without creating a bunch of weird access policies?\n How do we configure routes for traffic destined for the VPN subnet? Would it be as simple as creating a static route that points to the server's IP? Any past experience I've had with VPN involved them living on firewalls that did all of our routing, so it seems foreign doing things this way.\n  \nAny thoughts you folks have would be appreciated.

I just Frankensteined a pc with TrueNAS on it, I went to our network closet and saw that our cabling was Cat5, sadly didn't realize it was only Cat5, not 5e, so we ordered a Gigabit network switch and plugged her in and.... No gigabit speeds. Damn. Still only 10mbps when transfering to ol Frankenstein. Now I'm talking to the owner about running new lines under the building with Cat5e or Cat6a. Owner is kind of down, Co-owner who is 20 years younger is less down and thinks its absolutely not worth it and will barely impact our workflow. \n I've done a rough estimate on the plugs we actually use in the building, about 700' worth of cable so we'd buy a 1000' spool. My concern is the owners wife wants the building to be usable for the next person if they ever sell. When they built the place in 2006, they ran the Cat5 IN THE WALL using the \"Home Run\" method, where they drilled holes in every.. 2x4... and pulled the ethernet cable through. The owner is pretty sure they also stapled them to the 2x4s every so often. So there is no way of pulling them out. I think we reuse the current ethernet outlet spot, ditch the cable in the wall, and back in the \"network closet\" we shove the cat 5 cable in the wall and patch the drywall. Unless there is another use for Cat5 I'm not aware of that would be a good reason to get a dual plug and actually have both and make both usable. That would kind of solve both issues.

          "description": "Hi,\n We are a small business and so far MSP was handling the ASA 5515 firewall. We have let go of MSP and I am tasked with managing the firewall. I don't have much routing & switching knowledge (CCENT years ago). This may change, we might bring in network admin to configure the firewall and I guess I need to learn on the way to manage it. I might have to get a CCNA. I am a fairly new sysadmin for mostly linux/AWS and some windows.\n Currently we have about 15 users that use cisco anyconnect on Windows workstations and 6 linux users that use openconnect debian package for VPN. The internet speed is 250 Mbps symmetrical. 80% of infrastructure would be moved to cloud. Which firewall should be suitable for upgrading ? PA-440 would probably the most expensive although I don't even know the ballpark of the cost. \n Edit: We have four Ubiquiti USW-48 switches and one Dell Force10 S25. Two Unifi U6-LR access points. Less than 50 workstations.\n    submitted by    /u/chalreshammer12  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Multi Gig Small Office recommendations\n Hi Networking! I’m primarily an AV engineer but a facility I work with is looking to expand their 10 gig network. It’s a small office, less than 50 users (currently somewhere around 20 but may expand in the next few years), with several file servers on premise and a couple internet accessible services (behind reverse proxy through Argo tunnel). \n What we need: -10GBe access layer to the workstations. -high reliability -Ability to VLAN/ACL various devices for access to various file servers. So basically, nothing unmanaged. -Likely higher throughput trunks between servers and switches, and between switches. All our servers are equipped with 4x10gbe. Probably a good implementation of LACP and STP. -that’s it!\n What we would like: -centralized-ish management, ability to manage with APs would be a huge bonus. \n What we don’t really need: -POE\n Currently I run Meraki at my office, and I think this would be perfect but the cost of getting several MS355-24X (otherwise a perfect switch) might be prohibitive, and the license would compound that. I also run an Aruba Instant On network (automod removed my post for saying where), and their 1960 12XGT looks very interesting and priced very well, but I haven’t used any of their multi gig offerings. I like the ability to integrate with their wifi6 APs at a great price point too. Also highly considering the Cisco CBS 350 12XT and CBS 350 24XT. \n Just looking for opinions and thoughts!

Their tech support also called me at 130am that was fun. As time has gone on there have been more and more sites we have issues accessing. Seen at least 5 now that number could be higher as some teachers probably just don't report it and move on to something else. Have had the same colleague test those sites on their zayo connection with the same behavior. They all give some form of forbidden message. In the meantime I got our backup circuit setup in an sd-wan configuration on our firewall. So I just add those fqdn to the address group that is routed strictly out the backup circuit and they work just fine again. Has anyone ever had issues like this with an ISP?

          "description": "Hi all, recently the business I work for has been having frequent outages with our ISP. I have been asked to come up with a backup solution until the other ISP becomes available in the area. We got a 5G Business Hotspot from T-Mobile. Connection is great and we only have between 50-70 essential devices online at any given time. \n We just received the router and I am reading up on how to configure it properly. I will do my best to list the relevant facts about our network.\n ​\n Firewall is running Cisco ASDM 7.14\n ISP comes in through modem, routes to firewall and then firewall plugs to our LAN via Network Switches\n A Physical Windows Server provides DHCP for the network\n Same server is our DC as well\n ​\n I am wondering what I have to configure on the firewall to make sure it will allow the Hotspot to give internet connection to our devices without messing with their IP's or anything on the internal network.\n ​\n Maybe this is simpler than I am making it out to be and I just need to allow the external IP of the hotspot, disable DHCP on it then call it a day, but I'm not sure.\n They would also like me to configure it specifically just as a failover, so if the ISP goes down the firewall routes over to the hotspot automatically? But I am not sure if that is possible. Any help would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/IT_Velociraptor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We have a school that is occasionally maxing out a 1Gb connection from their ISP. ISP tells us that two 1Gb connections will be significantly more affordable than the single 2Gb connection they offer. This initially seemed great because we have 1 group of traffic we want to use one of the connections and 1 group of traffic we want to use the other connection. ISP is using GPON and I suspect they will give me an IP address for the second connection that is in the same subnet as the IP for the first connection and thus would have the same gateway. Most PBR scenarios I've seen set the next-hop IP based on the source network, but in this case the next-hop IP would be the same for both connections. Firewall at school is an ASA 5516-X. I initially preferred to use just a single firewall, but I do have some extra 5506-X I could deploy if necessary, recognizing the 5506-X won't do the full 1Gb. I'm not completely familiar with GPON, but perhaps I could request the second connection have an IP in a different subnet? \n Thinking a bit further, the school ASA in question currently has a VPN tunnel back to the datacenter ASA. I assume the school ASA is not going to establish a VPN tunnel to the datacenter from both of its IP Addresses, so I assume this is where a default route would come in and all traffic from both school subnets that need to traverse VPN tunnel would use the default route?\n    submitted by    /u/yllw98stng  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is the sensible way to approach implementing a hotel wifi guest network where every room has a wired smart tv and the guest has to have access only to the inroom TV and no other TVs.\n The way I assume its done is by creating a vlan per room and adding a TV per vlan.

Each provider has a 10 Gbps capacity, and are received on a switch, on SFP+ ports, except one of them that is connected to a QSFP+ port. For the BGP peering, will only accept a default route from each of the providers, i.e., we're not interested in Full-BGP support, the BGP peerings are there so that we can send a couple of IPv4 and IPv6 routes. For internal routing, we have an OSPF networtk with a routing table with about 7000 routes at the backbone.\n The thing is, our Mikrotik CCR1072 edge router is not scaling well, and we're planning on getting much more bandwidth on a couple of months. The current throughput is around 15 Gbps, and we're estimating that we will double it before july. \n I'm thinking of getting a L3 Switch with 40G/100G uplink that could connect to the edge switch, and manage the 3 peerings on this new switch (as a BGP edge router), so it will also handle the traffic. What L3 switch would you guys you recommend? I'd like a switch that could handle, say, 80 Gbps of routing? Considering the 3 peerings, and the 7000 OSPF routes.\n We're also evaluating buying a new router, but Cisco and Juniper routers are basically too expensive right now, and checking out FS.COM I saw a couple of switches that could probably do the job, like this bare metal switch https://www.fs.com/products/69226.html. \n Do you have any recommendations at a $10k-$15k budget?\n    submitted by    /u/engineering_hugo  \n [link]   [comments]",

All endpoints on this VLAN will be a device that will connect a VPN back to it's individual vendors home office to give them remote management access. \n Most of these devices come with a fairly well documented list of access requirements for the VPN to function. Meaning that the vendor has provided all the information needed to lock down the connection. This is great! But, to me, it is kind of silly to go to all the trouble of locking down 90% of these appliances if the other 10% are not well secured, get compromised, and end up allowing open access to everything else on that layer2 subnet. \n I already have the vlan/subnet locked down so that it has zero access to the internal network. But I would like to take it a step further by locking down layer2 communication in that vlan/subnet so that each endpoint can only communicate with the gateway (fortinet 80f) and outside internet. \n Rough breakdown of my hardware in place it as follows:\n Internet > Fortigate 80f > mdf-access - Cisco 3850 > core-switch - Cisco Nexus 3548P > idf-access - Cisco 3850 > Vendor Endpoints\n Internal network gateways live on the nexus 3548p which also handles the internal routing.\n Guest and isolated vlan/subnet gateways live on the fortigate.

Everything from what it prints down to even the color it prints in.\n So my question. Everything that NSO CARE does for checking STIGS (compliance checks, differences between golden configs and all other configs, filling out STIG checklists, etc.), could it all be done with ansible playbooks? I have some experience with ansible and python, and I have my own playbooks/scripts that do compliance checks, check differences between configs, tell me what STIG findings are open, etc. The only thing I really havn't figured out how to do yet that I really would like to be able to do is automate filling out the checklists. Not sure if thats possible with an ansible playbook or not.\n TLDR: Is Cisco NSO with CARE worth the cost, or can I just do everything with Ansible?\n    submitted by    /u/GC_Player  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I am working on a project right now and there is a change in ip address space of the ISP, they are moving from x.x.x.0/24 (old address space) address to y.y.y.0/24 (new address space). Both ranges are currently rout'able through the existing gateways but after the end of this week only y.y.y.0/24 will be available for us to use.\n The current problem we are facing is that we already setup everything in y.y.y.0/24 address space in advance (interface, gateway, nat, security policy etc), but there seems to be some issue with NAT overload (trusted to untrusted) rules and we are seeing the issues mostly with SIP and RTP traffic. The issue is that even if we have configured ip y.y.y.y on the untrusted/outside interface and have a NAT rule for outbound traffic (to use interface), the firewall is taking the old ip configured on the outside interface (x.x.x.x). Not sure why it's behaving like this for SIP and RTP but most of the other traffic is using the new IP (y.y.y.y). \n We verified if the traffic is hitting the correct policy using test and it's hitting the correct NAT rule and shows the correct translated address. But checking the active sessions using the show session commands shows it's not using the current interface ip but the old ip of the interface. We verified the output of the show session against the corresonding NAT rule and we can see the SIP/RTP sessions under that rule but using old ip as a translated source address.\n The firewall is on 8.1 version and upgrading is not an option right now as we are in a process of migrating the firewalls. Tried clearing the sessions, removing and re-adding the NAT rule, but this buggy behaviour exist. Should I disable SIP ALG/inspection and allow traffic through security policy?\n Apologies for the long post and any help is really appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/bobbythomastvm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I'm working with Cisco and Arista VXLAN Fabrics. We usually build them for small and midsize enterprises. Sometimes bigger ones. For me, most DCs have around 50 switches. \n But, after everything is finished and we take a look in the EVPN table, we find that they can get pretty big. Sadly most customers want \"every vlan everywhere!!!11\" which certainly won't help with scalability. As we have to add a VLAN to 50 switches, even if it's only used on 2 switches. \n After we did dig a bit in scalability and how to minimize table entries (depending on BGP design obviously). We are not sure how big someone could scale a standard VXLAN EVPN Fabric. Someone told me \"around 400 switchs, then it gets janky\" another one said \"we have 2000 switches in a campus VXLAN EVPN fabric, everything is fine\". So, how far can we/you go? What are the limits?\n I'm not talking about the routing table of the switches, of course some switches will fill their tables earlier than others. But if you use switches with millions of possible entieries, where is the limit?\n I know already that the public clouds don't use a DC network like the ones we build. They have \"software\" on their servers for their fabric and don't have all that state in their network. It wouldn't scale that big.\n    submitted by    /u/onyx9  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's possible to use a 'default' number of hops in the configuration or use a wildcard to match any number of hops. You can also make use of path explored by using the BGP traceroute command.\" \n I know that you can change the ttl value as needed but when you don't know the exact number, do you just estimate (and/or purposely overshoot it?). \n I like the idea of using traceroute to count the number of hops but on the internet I think some points can be blocked from being counted in traceroute (or may just the ip is blocked but you can count the \"*\" instead). I also assume that if there is any AS prepending along the way this number could be off. \n Specifically, do you, in practice, just type something like... \n  neighbor 192.52.100.2 remote-as 65555 neighbor 192.52.100.2 ebgp-multihop 255 \n and just hope that the neighbor's hop count away is within the max ttl value?\n    submitted by    /u/PrudentAd1132  \n [link]   [comments]",

As far as I'm aware, HSRP has no ability to do anything like route path monitoring.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/stealthmodeactive  \n [link]   [comments]",

Today the only visage left is Reddit and arguably Discord. More so, though, it seems the general attitude of everyone has changed from “Let’s discuss this, and I can help you clear up your confusion” to “I’m right, and watch me prove you wrong.” Sometimes this manifests itself as negative comments, but more often than not it’s downvotes.\n Now I don’t know about you guys, but I’m not on this sub for fake Internet points. Instead, I’d rather have meaningful conversations about networking, where I can potentially teach others about aspects of technology they don’t already know, and likewise, learn new things myself. Unfortunately, though, I find that pretty much no matter what people post, the peanut gallery is right there to shut them down.\n Three separate threads I replied to over this weekend with what I would consider helpful answers were deleted by the OPs, because they were getting hammered with replies to the effect of “wow you’re fucking dumb; go read your CCNA books again”.\n Is this really what we want to portray to people trying to get into this industry? Two mantras I’ve always told my students over the past 20+ years are that “the more you learn, the more you realize you don’t know”, and that “there are no stupid questions, only stupid people.”\n C’mon people, we’re better than this.

          "description": "Hi r/networking, I'm working on a (next gen) firewall solution for a data center (expected ~15k campus users).\n The specs require physical firewalls as opposed to virtual. \n Vendors I'm currently looking at are: CISCO, Forcepoint, Checkpoint, Palo Alto, Fortinet\n I need to suggest 3 vendors based on technical and commercial viability (budget isn't that tight, but we'd prefer a cheaper solution if the difference in quality isn't really all that). \n I've been looking at their documentation and data sheets and they all seem to have practically the same features, more or less. \n ​\n  \nIs there any clear winner among these? What differentiates them in terms of features and performance? They all seem to have the core capabilities of an NGFW: Packet Filtering (Layers 3 & 4), VPN, Stateful Inspection, Application Visibility & Control, Threat Intelligence, IPS.\n Relevant 3rd party benchmarks I'm looking at: Gartner and Cyber Ratings. Should these suffice? Which one should I prioritize? I've heard Cyber Ratings is more relevant since they actually test the hardware.\n Any other reliable sources that can help me evaluate and choose?\n I've heard Palo Alto is the gold standard, but is pricey (they reached out and said we can negotiate), and Fortinet is the most cost-effective and up-and-coming vendor. Is that true? \n I'm currently leaning towards Forcepoint, since they are making some compelling arguments. They seem to have the best Firewall performance. Some of the main points they mentioned about their NGFW's include: \n Best malicious signature detection, therefore best IPS/IDS. Apparently this is the most important metric to gauge a firewall's performance?\n Active-Active clustering for high availability \n Best in the market to protect against evasion attacks\n \n  \n​\n I would highly appreciate any and all insights based on your experiences and research!

That switch is unmanaged, but passes tagged frames through it unmolested. There are six devices on that switch that don't know how to emit tagged frames themselves, and need to talk on the same VLAN. That's obvious - switchport access vlan 57 would do the trick.\n But there's one device there that needs to be on VLAN 69. It can emit tagged frames, so configuring the port like so would seem right: switchport mode trunk switchport trunk native vlan 57 switchport trunk allowed vlan 57,69 \n But, the conundrum is this: how do I keep devices other than the one that's meant to be talking on VLAN 69, from doing so on that port? It seems straightforward to use a MAC access-list, except that there doesn't seem to be a way to apply it only for frames tagged for VLAN 69. The devices on VLAN 57 are subject to change, so enumerating their MAC addresses is a giant pain.\n What I'd like is this - permit any host to send untagged frames, which end up on VLAN 57. Permit only one authorized host to send tagged frames; if they're tagged for anything but VLAN 69 then the allowed vlan config should take care of it. Is there a straightforward way to do this on a 2960x without either enumerating all the authorized devices for VLAN 57, using dot1x, or putting a managed switch down there?\n    submitted by    /u/jade_nekotenshi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Small IT team covering everything, knowledgeable on networking but no expert.\n I'm trying to plan how to best configure a second L2 network link between our two sites without inadvertently creating a network loop, and where I cannot use spanning tree.\n We have two sites, each has connectivity via upstream provider which is part of the same organisation but separate (so we manage our own networking but don't have access to the upstream network), and we also use a bonded 2 x 1Gb Q-in-Q L2 tunnel over the upstream backbone connection to carry shared VLANs between sites.\n I now have a 10Gb dark fibre linking the sites directly, which I've initially configured with a single access VLAN to test connectivity but want to now configure as a trunk and gradually move the internal VLANs from the existing link to the new, ideally keeping the old link in place as a backup, or for less important traffic. The Q-in-Q tunnel strips out spanning tree packets. While I would remove a VLAN from the existing tunnel before adding it to the new link, I can't do that with the native VLAN 1, which would be present on both links and, without STP, would likely cause a loop.\n To further complicate things for me slightly, I'm running older Cisco kit at the first site (3850s at the core) and Ruckus at the second site (ICX 7650s) so configuration isn't just a copy/paste. Each site is its own spanning tree domain, so I'd be wanting to enable bpdufilter on the links anyway.\n Would setting the native VLAN on the new link to something other than default VLAN 1 solve this? Or should I bite the bullet, configure all the VLANs on the new link and simply shut down the old and enable the new, and be ready to switch back if it doesn't come up as expected? Or is there another approach? I'd prefer to do some more testing first, running the link as a trunk carrying a couple of test VLANs, but not causing a network loop is more important!\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ox-sjwk  \n [link]   [comments]",

This way all my users are on the same network internally and they aren't handicapped by the limitation of just 1 uplink connection.\n Can I do this? if so, any recommendations on hardware?\n If not, can you recommend another way to add up 10 or so connections to behave like 1 up link?\n    submitted by    /u/routaran  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the Xgspon is has started to be used, nokia has 25G pon. Huawei has its own version of 50G pon plus 100G pon has passed the standardization.\n So the question is does it really matter to use leased line if the same can be delivered effectively with 10,25,50 or 100G pon. I'm sure it's capacity will too rise in future.\n I kinda find it ridiculous that businesses pay huge amount for leased line when such solution are available.

My team would be in charge of the firewall and that's it. This... Seems like a bad idea to me? They don't have network experience nor Cisco experience and it's about 40-45 switches they'd take over. \n For folks with SCADA or PLCs in your environment, do you manage those networks? Do the plant operators? I'm looking to see what the SOP for this kinda thing is.

          "description": "I work for an engineering company that is testing some cellular modems. These modems need to hit internal systems for testing. The IPs of the cellular modems change frequently - within restarts or days - so having a trusted IP list in the access list won't work. Most of the services being hit from the NAT rule require some sort of authentication. However, this is for test engineers who have no reason to consider security. Along with that, they may be testing on an OS or services that have known vulnerabilities. \n I've been contemplating this for a few days and the only thing I can think of is to put the test VMs on a small private VLAN so their at least contained. On top of that, I figure I may as well add a list of trusted IPs based on the cellular network they are using to at least be somewhat explicit on the access list. However, with my ignorance of how their systems work, there is still the possibility of a bad actor exploiting some vulnerability and possibly getting some sort of foothold and/or company IP. This would be a very targeted attack, but I have to consider the possibility.\n Does anyone have any experience with supporting something like this or have a better idea on how to enable the engineers to get their jobs done while still keeping the company internal network secure along with any IP on the test systems?\n TL;DR: Engineers need to have cellular modems connect to systems on our internal network. My thought is a basic NAT rule allowing any outside connection to that IP:PORT for port forwarding to their systems which I put on a private VLAN.\n    submitted by    /u/BitteringAgent  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been trying to solve this for weeks now: \n Problem A) NFS connections on my network are barely usable, starting slow then slowing down even more until almost no more traffic passes trough writing/reading from NAS and/or other clients. SMB on the other hand works almost flawlessly though. Problem B) Every traffic from within the network actually doesnt seem to be steady and this behaves in a repeating pattern: it goes from fast to mediocre or even halts every few seconds goes back to full speed and then repeats this behavior after a a few seconds. It’s the same from outside the Network, downloading or uploading from/to the entire network: Client will actually see these interferences aswell.\n After everything I’ve tried I think I narrowed it down to UDP and probably one of the two switches in the network. IPerf between peers and/or NAS or other clients or servers: everything seems fine - except for UDP. Cant establish a connection. Netcat UDP works between all machines except one though : on that specific machine Netcat only works exactly ONCE and then loses (or closes?) the connection immediately. I had good NFS results with a test-share on the NAS when I explicitly disabled UDP + I don’t allow Sync - resulting in up to 1GB/s read and write to the NAS. (SMB is at about 600MB/s) MTU is 1500 everywhere. Turned off Auto-Negotiation and Flow Control everywhere. \n Any ideas what this could be?

Here are the results:\n ACI NOT Cisco - 4,344 \n Nexus Dashboard - 3 (All from Cisco)\n Arista CVP NOT Arista Networks - 4,145 \n NSX - 1,533 \n Apstra NOT Juniper Networks - 5 (3 of those were from \"Juniper Apstra\" so it's really 2 jobs)\n EVPN - 385\n VXLAN - 743 \n ​\n I feel like you all owe /u/bmcgahan an apology. Cisco is a vendor people love to hate on. Yes their licensing and certain marketing practices are despicable, but there seems to be a market out there for ACI, contrary to what people are saying. \n After this brief search, I plan to spend some time to learn more about the solution and see where the opportunities might be.\n Edit: Also to be fair and for context, Cisco is a behemoth of a marketing machine with many more feet on the ground when it comes to sales, so naturally their numbers are expected to be bigger.

          "description": "Sorry I'm going to be ranting a little bit, but perhaps we can also start a discussion.\n I recently had to work with a bunch of RJ45 connectors that had boots as shown in the picture:\n Awful boot\n And it was a somewhat frustrating experience. Not TOO bad, but I must say that is the dumbest connector boot design ever, and it's really popular for some reason.\n Here's why it's terrible. The flaps on the sides. I understand they are there to prevent the tab getting snagged on something. But they're not actually guaranteed to work for that because something can still technically get in between them and snag the tab.\n But by far the worst thing about them is that you cannot easily press the tab and release the connector. It's actually quite annoying, even when you figure out the best way to do it, you still can't quite get a good push on the tab and it often feels like you're scraping the connector as you're pulling the cable out.\n Every other design has realized this, so they have the anti-snag thing go over the tab so you can press on it directly and release the cable, also guaranteeing the tab will never get snagged. Easy, sensible, works. But whoever designed this boot was too stupid to realize this, did they even test their creation once? And then for some reason it caught on and is now quite a popular design.\n Am I missing something? It's terrible, right? I know I'm overreacting, but what are you gonna do... first world problems.\n Edit: Reading the comments, I guess I this is actually one of the nicer designs when you consider how god awful some of the other ones are, ending up under the tab or hardening over time... I just hate not being able to easily get my finger in between the flaps to press the tabs and now I see that it can be so much worse... LOL. Why isn't there a good design that just works that the industry can converge on.\n    submitted by    /u/Qbccd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I took some time out to dabble in cybersecurity tool integrations, however the only time I was really happy in that role was working with the network shops on the customer side, helping them configure, troubleshoot, and sharing knowledge along the way. So I decided to make a move back into networking. The welcome was warm and I quickly found a new home.\n So my question for the field - is GNS3 still the hotness when it comes to network modeling and plain old CLI practice? I need to get smart on Cisco DC in a hurry, and already targeted CCNP DC since the new environment is heavy on Nexus 9k infrastructure with a sizeable SAN. All of the campus networks are Catalyst 9k. I have dabbled with Nexus in the past, but only at a very basic level so I need to explore the advanced features and nerd knobs.\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/mista_dabid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello! We have a bunch of mobile devices that operate on a private 4G network (VLAN 405, 10.1.18.x/24). Long-story short, these devices transmit/access sensitive info and we'd like to make sure their traffic is handled as such. We are setting up a vendor VPN server that will encrypt traffic between those devices and the traffic's destination. The VPN configures an always-on virtual NIC and virtual IP on these devices; the assignment pool can be any of our choosing.\n Our firewall has a subinterface for VLAN 405, which is on a /30 network with the cellular provider's router. That then communicates with any devices on 405. My question is, if these devices now get fancy new virtual IPs from a completely different range (let's say 192.168.1.0), how will traffic flow be affected? Will I need to create a new VLAN and/or subinterface in addition to new access rules in order for traffic from these devices to continue to be allowed? Or can I just configure access rules to allow the new range on the existing subinterface? My apologies if this is a trivial question, I feel like the answer is on the tip of my tongue while also feeling thoroughly confused.\n    submitted by    /u/nst_hopeful  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My team has been tasked with blocking traffic between wireless clients. For our local sites this has been fairly simple as we can enable P2P blocking for the group of APs and be done with it. Unfortunately for Flex Connect sites, this function only works on a per AP basis and is a known limitation. This means that a client on AP1 cannot talk to another client on AP1, but can talk to a client on AP2.\n I've been experimenting a bit with private Vlans as I have a theory that if the APs are in isolated Vlans then they cannot talk to each other and the P2P block should work for the APs themselves, but testing has been slow and there's doubts this could work for our environment on a larger scale. \n Curious to hear what solutions your teams have come up with to enable client isolation. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/SPNCER  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I posted here about a week ago regarding a design decision for a customer and got a lot of great feedback.\n Now, I been thinking about another aspect of the design and my brain won't let me understand the logic here, here is the design: https://imgur.com/gyI2ihY \n Network setup: \n  \n2 fortigates, HA active/passive. \n 2 switches, will form MLAG with the firewalls. Will also run VRRP and vPC between the switches.\n Three servers connected to both switches\n SVI:s (default gateways for the VLANs) will be terminated on the firewall\n Internet will terminate on the switches. \n Only one ISP circuit, they will handoff two ports from their wan switch, each physical cable will be connected to each switch. \n  \n​\n Now to my question, since the SVI/gateways for the servers will be terminated on the firewall, how will I then configure the VRRP on the switches? The way I've been configuring VRRP before, I always configured the SVI:s and VRRP on the same \"equipment\" (switch/router etc) if that makes sense.. \n So for example, let say we have vlan 200 and a subnet of: 10.200.10.0/24 and I want to configure VRRP on the switches:\n SW1:\n Interface vlan 200\n ip addr 10.200.10.1/24\n vrrp 1 ip 10.200.10.99\n vrrp 1 prio 120\n preempt\n etc... \n SW2:\n Interface vlan 200\n ip addr 10.200.10.2/24\n vrrp 1 ip 10.200.10.99\n preempt\n etc...\n Now, this is if the SVI:s would be terminated on the switches. But I would like to terminate the SVI:s on the firewall and not on the switch. Taking that approach (terminating SVI:s on the firewall): from the switch, I will just create a L2 VLAN and trunk it to the firewall. \n ​\n I know of course that I do not want to terminate the SVI:s on the firewall, I could just terminate the SVIs on the switch and then run VRRP on the switches as well, but I would like to know if what I ask is doable, if so, how and why? \n I could overthink this but please, help me to understand it. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/donutspro  \n [link]   [comments]",

The application recently stopped working, and analyzing the network traffic reveals that there is no response back from the server. Just seeing a multitude of SYNs from the clients, and never any SYN+ACK from the server.\n We set a SPAN up directly on the server’s ports and see the SYNs egressing towards the server, and no SYN+ACK ingressing, we effectively proved traffic is making it all the way to the server, and the server is not responding to the traffic.\n After a while the ticket comes back to us saying the app owner had a call with the support vendor and they found nothing wrong and wanted the network checked for blocks.\n Same situation on second look, all SYNs no responses. This time we did some troubleshooting on the server itself and NETSTAT showed an anomaly. It showed ESTABLISHED connections with all of the clients trying to reach it, on the port they’re sending on…\n How is this possible? For NETSTAT to show ESTABLISHED on a TCP connection, it means there had to be a 3-way handshake, right?

I'd also then be responsible for creating and giving presentations about what our recommendations are, creating detailed designs and implementation plans and then be the primary technical POC during proof-of-concept implementations. There would be lots of client interaction, lots of face time, and at least 20% travel with the rest being fully remote. Lots of creating documentation & designs, and then sometimes assisting (at a high level) with implementation.\n All of this sounds great to me, at least on paper. It's the stuff that I love doing, without as much of the drudgery of day-to-day tickets. I spend my entire day already elbow-deep in this specific vendors products anyway, so if anything I'd have to go even deeper into their product offerings across the board.\n The compensation numbers being tossed about are . . . uh, generous to say the least. And that doesn't hurt the appeal.\n My questions are:\n 1. What are these jobs actually like, and what makes someone good at them? 2.

A whole bunch of them have Nintendo Switches and I also have one at hand, however they will not connect to the internet through our \"WPA Personal\" Ubiquiti SSID. (Nintendo Switches are simply incompatible with \"WPA Enterprise\" which we use for our main Wi-Fi network) They connect to the network with the password but throw back the message \"Registration is required to use this network\" when trying to connect to the internet. I HAVE done research but I can't find any actual solutions. Other Universities appear to collect MAC Addresses from the students and just add them manually which is no problem but I haven't the slightest idea where to do this after gathering the device's MAC Addresses.\n I think either our WatchGuard firewall or RADIUS is causing the problem but maybe I've missed a setting in the SSID setup I really don't know. I have full access to every server, everything. I just haven't a clue what to do with the Nintendo Switch's MAC Address to get it to connect to the internet :(\n Currently, I have a test \"Nintendo\" SSID on the nearest access point to me which I plan to use to troubleshoot the issue further. If I can get it to work here though I'll push it out to the other 80 access points.\n Willing to follow any guidance and answer any questions. I hope someone has come across this before.

If CG-NAT Needs ports to translate from Public - WAN - Private Addresses why couldn't we send a packet with the private address alongside the Public one that the router can read thus allowing for private port forwarding rules to work through the Carrier Router\n Note: I'm a complete networking novice talking out my ass hoping I understand at least 30% of what I'm talking about...

The interesting thing is that the networking (and firewall) is provided by a different company with the core being in an entirely different locale. The good news is that in our building, we have a switch in the basement with a few ports that assign WAN IPs. \n Using this, I set up a pfSense firewall and hooked up to WAN and LAN. At Site B we have a UniFi USG4. I set up an IPSec tunnel between the two, and got as far as being able to resolve the Windows domain from Site B, and ping the (real) LAN gateway but not any further. NO domain controller traffic was able to pass. \n Basically my thoughts were that since I have access to both a WAN IP, and the local subnet that 99% of our Windows machines are on, I had everything I needed to create a tunnel from inside of the other company's network and get our Site B network connected to resources that Site A uses WITHOUT asking the other company to make any changes.

It should be blocking Po2 according to plan. \n SW2#show spanning-tree blockedports Name Blocked Interfaces List -------------------- ------------------------------------ MST0 Po1 \n Could you please give me some advice?\n The network diagram is here\n Important config parts:\n SW1#show running-config\n ! spanning-tree mode mst ! spanning-tree mst configuration name axia revision 1 instance 1 vlan 192 ! spanning-tree vlan 1,816 priority 12288 ! interface Port-channel1 switchport trunk allowed vlan 816 switchport mode trunk spanning-tree mst 0 port-priority 192 spanning-tree mst 1 port-priority 64 ! interface Port-channel2 switchport trunk allowed vlan 192,816 switchport mode trunk spanning-tree mst 0 port-priority 64 spanning-tree mst 1 port-priority 192 ! \n SW2#show running-config\n ! spanning-tree mode mst ! spanning-tree mst configuration name axia revision 1 instance 1 vlan 192 ! spanning-tree vlan 1,816 priority 12288 ! interface Port-channel1 switchport trunk allowed vlan 816 switchport mode trunk spanning-tree mst 0 port-priority 192 spanning-tree mst 1 port-priority 64 ! interface Port-channel2 switchport trunk allowed vlan 192,816 switchport mode trunk spanning-tree mst 0 port-priority 64 spanning-tree mst 1 port-priority 192 ! \n    submitted by    /u/tommyd2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m a vaguely technical project manager (so apologies if some of the terminology is wrong) and I’m curious about what a future enterprise network might look like. Today we have a fairly traditional on-prem design. 2 data centres, some public facing services, VMware, F5 load balancers, mostly Cisco everything else including core switches.\n At each site we have MPLS, and local internet breakout from the same provider as the MPLS. We have Cisco L3 edge switches, and Cisco wireless access points managed via controllers at the DCs. All internet traffic goes out via the local break out, not over the MPLS.\n Most of our end user and public facing services are already in the cloud, with the rest moving over the next 3 years. And the data centres will reduce to a couple of racks of legacy internal and public facing systems.\n Endpoint security will be on the devices (zScaler), and the view is that the office network will end up no more trusted than any other network.\n At that point in 3 years time, my questions are why do we need a WAN, why do we need core switches and routing or expensive MPLS circuits? Then why do we need L3 edge switches?\n In my simple mind we would need reliable managed internet access and WiFi with a management platform. Not even sure if we need much wired Ethernet except for printers and a few other appliances. Everyone has laptops and we don’t have desk phones. Mostly normal Microsoft Office based workloads.\n So would we effectively be no different to a rent-an-office location? What equipment and management tooling do they use? Still Cisco?\n Thanks for indulging me!\n    submitted by    /u/a4333387775  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am using Python to automate configuration commands to Adtran OLT network devices. Currently, the app mostly works in the sense of being able to issue commands to retrieve information tables for parsing.\n The problem I'm up against is when I start sending commands back to apply configuration changes, something very weird happens with the CLI which I can replicate exactly through my Gnome Terminal by pasting the same commands that break in the automated interactive shell.\n Here is an example of the command set where the problem starts:\n enable config t shaper “interface gpon 1/0/1@1/4/1.gpon channel 1” 1@1/4/1.gpon rate 500000 exit shaper “remote-device 1@1/4/1.gpon_0” 1/4 rate 500000 exit exit \n For reasons unknown to me, once the space after the second double quote is sent, the shell does something weird and the command breaks as invalid.\n Here is a visual example of what happens to the CLI in Gnome Terminal which is essentially the same result I see with the automated shell as well: https://imgur.com/a/Id8snAA\n The automated shell is currently using a vt100 terminal type if that helps any. For the record, the command examples provide have been tested directly through a shell on a macOS computer and they work as intended there so the command format is where it should be.\n Any takers on what I'm missing here?\n    submitted by    /u/TesNikola  \n [link]   [comments]",

So i recently attempted to migrate a clients core switches from 2 Nexus 3ks in a VPC configuration over to 2 Arista 7020sr’s in a VRRP / MLAG configuration. \n After swinging cables, everything was working except for ONE virtual machine server (which was of course mission critical). This server lives on their one and only ESX vSphere host, on VLAN 100. Mind you, there’s about 15 other servers on this VLAN 100 network that were working just fine.\n VLAN 100 lives on the core switches, with the VIP being 10.64.100.1/23 shared between both switches, and .2 and .3 physical IPs living on switch 1 and switch 2 respectively. So .100.1 is the default gateway for all the virtual servers. \n Their ESX host connects to the switches via a port channel that participates in MLAG, and carry’s all vlans across it. \n Now the issue we were seeing on this single server (which was address .100.147) was that it was not installing arp entries correctly. It was unable to ping its default gateway (.100.1) and ONLY had an arp entry for .100.3, which is the physical IP for VLAN 100 on switch 2. All other servers were correctly installing the arp entry for the VIP .100.1 as expected, but this single server was the only one not properly handling ARP entries. \n Any ideas on this one? I’m quite new to using VRRP / MLAG so i wasn’t sure of any possible limitations, or what i should be looking for in vCenter or on the VM settings. \n Any help would be appreciated!

          "description": "Preface: Yeah, I know. \"Don't span L2\". This is one potential option for a migration from a legacy network in an industrial environment, not a traditional enterprise environment. There are options to migrate to a routed design but it would be significantly more work so I'm considering this option as well. \n For the topology, imagine 50 routers with wifi and ethernet interfaces (bridged), connected in client mode to a backhaul wifi mesh. The same subnet should be available on ethernet behind all of them. Minimal performance requirements means it doesn't matter if they all terminate at a single hub and have to route through the hub every time to reach each other.\n My first thought was EVPN/VXLAN over IPSEC tunnels in a hub and spoke setup, however I don't think the Cisco IR1821 (which is otherwise perfect for this design) supports EVPN. I may try to find the minimum device that supports it and see if it fits the budget because its fairly standard at this point.\n Next was L2TPv3 but it appears to be point to point only, i.e., the hub could only have a L2 pseudowire terminate with one other device.\n Just bridging ethernet onto the mesh and encrypting the mesh isn't an option unfortunately.\n Are there any options I'm missing? \n To avoid an XY problem: the only requirements are that layer 2 traverses the backhaul network, encrypted/terminated by well-known-ish-vendor devices we control (not the mesh itself). Bonus points if the terminating devices include the wifi radio because it removes a point of failure.\n    submitted by    /u/Substantial-Guava  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been doing quite a bit of research regarding design and deployment best practices, but I have a few questions that I'd like your thoughts about.\n Thus far my Ipv6 addressing plan is to assigned /64 to all service provider infrastructure, such as customer facing interfaces and VLANs, /56 for PD, and /127 for p2p segments.\n  \nIn accordance with RFC 6177, I'll plan on assigning /56 prefixes to customer end sites using DHCPv6-PD. When a customer site receives a PD, how does my PE router know what interface to route the assigned PD prefix towards the customer? I'm not sure if this is vendor specific, but let's assume I'm using Windows Server for DHCPv6 server and my PE is a Cisco Catalyst 9500.\n \nWhen a customer wants public Ipv4 space from us we usually just allocate a /29 and statically route that prefix to the customers IP on the p2p segment. Is this methodology considered best practice for Ipv6 also? \n \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ZNastyyy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyhoo, I mainly work on PON systems and the corresponding CPE that we deploy at sites. What I am struggling at the moment with that I am trying to solve is that we currently have the Calix Cloud services to onboard and monitor the Calix Routers we deploy along with some Nokia Beacons from a prior agreement that I am trying to pass down a DHCP statement to onboard them into the TR-069 server without the Calix routers having to phone home first to get their TR-069 address because that takes forever and the Nokias want to phone home to their native address that is burned into the firmware which is what I want to avoid. I've already created my class statement in the DHCP server config matching the OUI of all the models we deployed but when it comes to the subnet pool statement, I either have the option of only allowing members of the class to get a DHCP lease from the pool or I can issue a \"allow unkown-clients\" statement which pushed the option 43 statement to all devices in that pool.

I spent a while in a couple NOCs and worked with tens of thousands of telco circuits ranging from ISDN to 100G wave and dark fiber.\n In my time I don't think I've had a pain in the ass ticket like I've been working on for a couple months now. So I wanted to get the group's opinions as people with more experience than me.\n So here's the skinny. I've had a ticket open with <A major US tier 1 backbone provider> for about 3 months now on a single problem child 10G wave circuit between two of my regional DCs. It's one of two redundant links running on a diverse path. Both sides of my equipment show the same problems at the same time. They'll show the interface connecting to the circuit going down with a reason of Link failure. It'll be down a…",

The AnyConnect client doesn't give any feedback about needing them to accept the push notification.\n Has anyone done anything to work around this? Is there any customization that can be done in AnyConnect to show them that they need to accept the request?\n I see that the PAP option has more options, but 1. isn't PAP considered insecure? 2. I am using class 25 to send back a tunnel group after they login, and from what I'm reading in other threads, PAP may break that functionality with Windows NPS.\n I did see this about PAP in a Cisco doc, but I'm still a bit uneasy about using PAP:\n  \nBy default, the ASA uses the unencrypted Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) authentication type. This does not mean that the ASA sends the password in plain text when it sends the RADIUS REQUEST packet. Rather, the plaintext password is encrypted with the RADIUS shared secret.

If you need a short run, lets say maybe 0.5 - 1 foot I know what you can get DAC cables of that length, but what about using SFP/SFP+ connectors with fiber cables into a LC/LC fiber keystone? \n TLDR; From a practicality and performance standpoint, would there realistically be any issues with using SFP/+ modules and LC fiber cables to connect switching appliances for short runs instead of DAC?

Multiple sites connected over a Metro E connection. Would a hub and spoke or a point to point be better for this application. I would think a hub and spoke would be best due to limiting the broadcast seen by other switches. To give you an idea of my network, on a daily basis I sit at roughly 14,000 devices. I think a hub and spoke is the way to go due to limiting traffic on the incoming interfaces to what is destined to that router. The switches all share the same native vlan 300 (no IPs exist). Each individual site and the shared core have a unique vlan (vlan 30x) with their own /30 between the two. \n Even though they all share the same metro e, am I correct in saying a hub and spoke separated by vlans (30x) would be better then all of the sites sharing the same vlan (300)? The sites really dont have a reason to communicate between each other. Traffic mostly goes between the site and the core, then out to the internet. \n Thank you for your help.\n    submitted by    /u/BucknerIT  \n [link]   [comments]",

I noticed a decent chunk of packet loss, but it's in the middle of a canyon and the only connection we are able to get at the moment is LTE.\n In the past I had written this off as a bad connection due to LTE and haven't looked into it a ton, but after monitoring the LTE modem I didn't see a ton of packet loss to it. I figured no problem, they get a ton of power outages, and don't have a generator.\n Their router is likely fried. Since it's the middle of the winter I held off on driving to the site until I had a free day to tackle it. I replaced the router and tested and everything seemed fine, but after a few days I started seeing heavy packet loss again.\n Looking at the logs I'm seeing that it's giving ESP errors and all of my phase 2 tunnels are constantly going up and down. I've verified that all algorithms match up perfectly along with DH and autokey time. The VPN profile is a carbon copy of all of my other sites but this is the only one that has any issue.\n My setup from the branch to the data center is Fortigate (Station FW) -> Cradle point Modem (LTE) -> Palo Alto (Data center FW). My ping times vary between 100-500ms and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar whether doing passthrough with a cradlepoint or with high latency causing the tunnel to constantly crash.

A week does not goes by with out us having to reset our cable modem or/and deal with a couple minutes outages, sometimes even hours. We are subscribed to the 600/35 plan. I have always wanted more upload speeds so we started looking for a fiber connection.\n After contacting 3 ISP I narrow it down to two companies. One is offering 1gbps symmetrical from one of their nearby PON for $489 no SLA, this connection is not dedicated, but the sales person claims that the PON is not currently being used by any other company and this has been the case for years, he even claimed (and I actually believed this) this should remain the case since the types of businesses in my street are not the type to required these speeds or reliability. The second company is able to provide a dedicated fiber line to their datacenter, after weeks of negotiation I was able to get them to come down to $730 a month for 1gbps with a 99.999% SLA. Both connections requires a 48 months agreement. Honestly we dont need this level of connection but we could really use the upload speeds to run our own cloud storage solution (nextcloud, plex, databackup services) and couple other things. in reality a 100x100mbps connection is sufficient but the price at that point wouldn't be substantially lower since they need to recover their construction cost.\n My question is, under these circumstances would you pay $241 more to have the dedicated connection with a SLA and guaranteed speeds, latency and data packet loss? or should I just save the money and go with the cheaper solution.

          "description": "God I hate Cisco. I'm a CCNP but god they are the worst the past few years.\n Configured a new ASA 1010 and shipped it to a branch across the country to replace a dead 5505. Of course with the 1010's, Cisco must assume all of their customers manage a single, local branch, because they don't let you use crypto commands until you register with the Smart portal to unlock strong encryption (you know, that thing that was preloaded on all the 5500 series firewalls since the PIX's went EOL???). So that means I have to wait until the site connects it to the WAN cable to get internet before I can register it and unlock VPN commands, which the business won't run without. Even worse is when it needs to go to a country in another timezone. On the 5506's I used to be able to just preconfigure the VPN, ship it and tell the on site guy to move the cables over when he starts his day in his timezone and all will work. No no. Now Cisco wants me to wake up at 2am (8am for the site the ASA is getting installed at) so I can register with them, and THEN...only then will they let me register and be granted permission to unlock crypto commands. Scum.\n Today this scenario happened for me, but the Smart Portal is spitting traceback errors at me, and as a result, I can't view my inventory or create new license tokens, which means I can't register the 1010 to be able to put the VPN's up, and had to roll everything back. \n Come on Cisco. Your ASA customers are NOT Fisher Price engineers managing one location, and nobody that buys an ASA is doing so for their home. Yet you insist on making things easier for residential and mom/pop shop operations and harder for enterprise/commercial grade large multi-location international companies with every new generation of hardware.\n    submitted by    /u/TheFaytalist  \n [link]   [comments]",

It takes some work to explain. \n For context, I took over at my location about nine months ago. We recently had a scheduled power outage at our location. Our primary devices were on generators to prevent them from shutting down. Other devices around the location did get powered off. \n Our core switch is a Ruckus ICX7650-48F. After power was restored, I cannot ssh into any Cisco switch directly connected to the core. Any HP/Aruba device directly connected works with SSH and ping. The same is true for any cisco device downstream from an HP/Aruba. \n Although this is happening, everything around the site is running fine from an operational standpoint. We have wireless and all ethernet working. \n We have a Cisco 3650 directly below the core in the rack that I've been troubleshooting. When I checked spanning-tree on it, I noticed a VLAN ID mismatch with two different VLANs. Our management VLAN and the Trunk VLAN. Nothing has changed in the configuration, and I've double checked that there isn't a mismatch like it says. I get this error with all Cisco switches. \n I've done quite a bit of troubleshooting and need more ideas. If you need more information, I will make sure to send that to you by PM. \n Thank you!!\n TLDR: Scheduled power outage, and the management VLAN doesn't work on Cisco devices.\n    submitted by    /u/Subject-Honey-4137  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My understanding with something like Zscaler is that it's done by stitching Layer 7 TLS tunnels. There is an App Connector component which functions like a reverse proxy. It sits in front of the application server and establishes outbound connection/tunnel to the Zscaler cloud (Service Edge). On the user's device, the client software also creates an outbound tunnel to the Zscaler cloud. The two tunnels are stitched together by the Zscaler Service Edge. For each client-to-app connection, there is a separate micro-tunnel pair.\n I think Azure AD Application Proxy works in similar way except instead of client software it's just the client's web browser. Basically a client-less version.\n Have I understood this correctly and do all other ZTNA products work the same way?\n    submitted by    /u/steelstringslinger  \n [link]   [comments]",

The router has an adapter configured for 172.16.31.10, and a DHCP service to serve IPs on that address. It is bridged to the host ethernet adapter (set to 172.16.31.9) which goes via a switch to a Ruckus WLC, which is connected to an access point. Currently I can connect to the wireless network provided by the WLC, but my PC does not get an IP address on that network at all. The address for the configuration interface on the WLC is 192.168.10.14. Does this need to be set to the 172.16.31.x subnet, and if so should the gateway be the vyos router address? I can only find articles that explain WLCs from a high level, or in depth configuration guides for specific WLCs that assume an in depth knowledge of networking (which I do not have.. only some basics). My current understanding is that the vyos router should serve up IP addresses via the host (since it is bridged) and then the WLC should 'pass that' via the access point to my PC. Since it isn't working I'm guessing that is incorrect, but I don't have enough knowledge yet to know where to start looking for the issue or how to trace it.

I run EIGRP between the MPLS PE and my core so that when the routes go down that traffic is then routed out the default gateway. This works great for when users were in the office but with the shift to remote/hybrid its causing some voice quality issues for remote users.\n Users have been told to use the tunnel all option to force that voice traffic through the VPN and across the MPLS. Obviously tunneling all their traffic is less than ideal and we get a fair amount of complaints about slow downloads and poor voice quality. We do have split-tunneling but that sends that voice traffic out their local gateways and that can be painful as well. We are doing dynamic split-include for some other domains but without the MPLS need on the backend. \n What I am trying to figure out is if I add this voice domain to that split include will it route it via the MPLS when the routes are present and out through the ASA when the routes are gone (because MPLS is down)? That domain would be tunnel'd all the time and I simply don't know how it will work when the routes are gone?\n    submitted by    /u/heyitsdrew  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I were to do an nslookup to get a hostname from that IP that the software is communicating with it resolves a AWS datacenter address, but if I know the address that it is communicating with say... (prod1.SASvendor.com) it resolves to to that IP. I assumed that when the firewall is asked to resolve the DNS record it becomes aware of the FQDN and says ok yep that is good, but my DNS server is not forwarding DNS to the firewall, so how does the firewall know that an IP address is part of the *SASvendor.com domain?

Does it worth to implement SDA or is it better to stick with traditional design Collapsed Core.\n Existing network is basically all Layer 2 VLANs extend up to SVIs on core switches.\n We don't have NAC solution at present but surely will be added with upgrade project.\n Appreciate any advice.\n    submitted by    /u/techno_it  \n [link]   [comments]",
