          "description": "Anyone ever done a Unit4 ERP implementation? What’s your impression of the company? What was the process like?\n Currently I’m the IT person on the project team handling SSO and user provisioning and I can wholeheartedly say that they leave a really bad impression in every possible way so far. Their in-house consultants are absolutely clueless and the processes are archaic. I am just in shock after every meeting.\n  \nYou want SSO? Create a ticket and someone in a completely different time zone will not read your request properly and it will take days to sort things out.\n What does the user status “Parked” and “Terminated” mean? No clue. One “consultant” went so far as to suggest to read F1 help - which of course did not help.\n What should be considered when choosing a user ID? Silence.\n Generally they can maybe answer about 10% of the questions, for the rest they need to ask someone else. Sometimes they even get back to you after that.\n  \nIt’s a bit of a nightmare and other departments engaging with different consultants share that feeling. Curious what your experience is. Or does just every ERP implementation suck?\n    submitted by    /u/Puzzles9193  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Let me say, I am not network smart at all.\n Currently my company advocates for static IP at the printers. We had some printers get moved around and lost their connections. I was told is because the new ports are not on the same subnet. I have no idea what that means but it sounded cool. \n The other thing that is going on, the network guys want to subnet for printers and other collections. This means we have to re-IP all printers.\n I suggested that we us hostnames/FQDN for printers and it was like I was talking about someone religion, or their parents, or the best motor oil. \n It seems to me if we go with a standard host naming convention and connected to those printers via FQDN rather than IP, things would run a lot smoother and the network chasers can re-IP all they want. \n what is/are the best business practices here, short of chaining the printers to the wall?\n    submitted by    /u/rafiki-knows  \n [link]   [comments]",

My user raised a ticket and I investigated. I knew nothing about this vendor of ours besides the domain. I queried the domain registrar for the owner email address and got the private registration proxy one. Armed with this information I fired a quick email to the following addresses about the security incident:\n  \nRegistrar proxy\n abuse@\n security@\n webmaster@\n hostmaster@\n support@ \n  \nThe IT team of the vendor resolved the issue and I got a thank you email from them.\n However, of all these, only the webmaster@ address worked, the rest bounced back.

          "description": "Hello! I have recently been tasks with trying to stand up a T3200 array that was decommissioned before my time. The previous admin is no longer around…. And you guessed it, no password logs anywhere. I see that there is a process with a serial cable to reset the admin password but it also notes that it erases the data on the system. I have been asked to retrieve some of the data on this unit so I don’t think I should do that. Does anyone know of any other options? \n Also, I cant seem to find any technical documentation on this unit. With the WD and DDN acquisitions I have no idea where to get any documentation….. or what support number I can call. \n Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Civil-Secret-1535  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the last 24hrs I’ve been fighting the console along with other menial tasks that come along with the platform. I finally came to terms to just blow the install all away to start fresh again. I’ve been working with WSUS for the last 6yrs now with plenty of headaches I’d like to get rid of. So I’m reaching out to find some other patch management suggestions. We are a small business, I’m sure we can manage about 5k/yr but I’m trying to find something a little lower on the cost side if any. Also, if the solution could inventory the machines and present what patches are needed by machines (similar to WSUS), that would be a bonus.

The link, if you have it, is https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?ref=MessageCenter/:/messages/MC541626 If you don't have it, here are the screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/qVMQxbl\n Basically it's a new feature coming where when you click a link in an email in Outlook on Windows, it opens Edge with a copy of the email as a side panel. Sounds kind of neat.\n But to make sure everyone experiences this, Outlook will also start ignoring your system's default web browser and opening links in Edge no matter what. Users whose default has always been Chrome, and whose bookmarks and saved passwords are all in Chrome, will be highly confused by a very similar-looking browser that has none of their stuff. They'll probably call the helpdesk screaming \"why did you delete all my stuff?!?!\"\n The user can change this in settings, but options being offered for admins to shut this off is lacking. Both options listed (the cloud policy service and group policy) explicitly apply only to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (not business).\n So, for SMBs there seems to be no way out besides manually touching each machine. Of course, it remains to be seen if perhaps the end-user setting is in a registry key instead of some secret place... we can only hope...\n    submitted by    /u/PowerShellGenius  \n [link]   [comments]",

We had a different MSP for 10 years but due to some contract negotiation differences, we could not come to an agreement. The new MSP needed Jump boxes in the environment to use as administration systems to work from. \n ​\n They requested 18 boxes 1 for each person. the box requested was a server 2016+ and local admin rights plus rights to have basic administration of DNS, DHCP, etc. We provided the boxes and the accounts. \n ​\n Today (yay Friday!) I happen to refresh my server manager and find a few new ADCS boxes. So I looked at all servers on the network to find what roles were installed. I found many jump boxes had ADCS, ADFS, ADDS, DHCP, DNS, and ADLDS. etc. Many even had LDS instances. \n ​\n I contacted the Helpdesk manager and asked why these servers have these roles installed when they are only meant for jump boxes and they didn't follow the documented change management process. \n He then proceeded to respond \"We needed these so we could administrate these services on the servers,\" I asked him why they didn't use RSAT because installing these roles leaves the environment up to more risks. He seemed surprised at the existence of RSAT. \n ​\n I am very frustrated that the MSP would install and configure critical roles on jump boxes in the environment but I am also Dumbfounded that the basic tools for administration seemed to be unknown to them and it makes me question their knowledge. They to me seem to be a huge risk at this point. \n ​\n Would it be a deal breaker for anyone here? Would you cancel the contract?\n    submitted by    /u/sh4d0w1021  \n [link]   [comments]",

To connect the device to the monitor we had to use a USB C to displayport cable. \n The NUC displays an image when first turned on, but if the monitor is power cycled, the image stays black, and eventually the monitor will go back to sleep since it's not receiving an image. \n I've updated the thunderbolt drivers, the bios, and the VGA drivers in the NUC but nothing seems to work. I've checked the power plan settings on the device as well as adjusting to maximum performance in the BIOS. \n Interesting enough, unlike the other nucs in the room, when you vnc into the device with the monitor off it shows the full 1920x1080 and a monitor connected, while the older nucs revert to 800x600 and no monitor connected. \n Due to the configuration of this room, using the HDMI out of the NUC is currently not an option. My next step will be to order an active HDMI to displayport cable. \n Our NUC10's have no issue using USB-C to DP. I'm Curious if anyone else has any experience with USB-C display out issues with these NUC11 and if you have a solution.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/34orks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I hope you have a better read only Friday than me ! \n One of our domain controller which is physical computer installed in a other site far away from my office, has no trust relation with our Active Directory, so it’s impossible for us to access it anymore. It happened after a “little” mistake was made. Basically this server is gonna be replaced and we need to clone it and redeploy it on a new VM in our hyperV cluster, for a specific software installed on it. So the clone was done, using disk2vhd cloning C: of that server, and mounted on a new VM, the new vm wasn’t connected with network until the IP was changed, but to change the name of that new VM, it was needed to downgrade the VM from DC to non DC, and to do this it had to be connected to the network, and it’s at that moment where we had the conflict, which made our physical machine loose the trust relationship and removed itself from our AD.\n Has anyone of you an idea on how to make the physical server re join our AD and being able to connect on it ? Beside going physically on site where the server is located which is a 6 hour drive from office. We can’t connect with any AD account because no trust relation, and no local account possible because it’s a domain controller.\n Sorry for my bad English, not my native language,\n    submitted by    /u/Femboy6372819  \n [link]   [comments]",

Checking for updates through any of the apps, it will start to download an apply an update. Once this has completed, M365 is downgraded to the build that was released on March 20th, 16130.20332.\n We're able to manually update back to the latest build by using the C2R updater and referencing the build number: \"C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\ClickToRun\\OfficeC2RClient.exe\" /update user updatetoversion=16.0.16227.20280\n Going through the GUI update process will again downgrade it to 16130.20332.\n Checking our registries, we can see that in HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\ClickToRun\\Configuration, the \"VersionToReport\" key references the latest build. My assumption is that this entry is used when checking for updates.\n So, maybe some funny business at Microsoft's end this morning?

          "description": "I've been tasked with replacing our security camera NVR. We've currently got a 16 channel Hikvision unit that (while being a major step up from our old java-based D-Link DVRs) is a pain in the butt with it's requirements for proprietary video plugins and management software that demands local admin rights.\n Fortunately, we have contractual obligations with some of our customers that prevent us purchasing any additional Hikvision equipment (NDAA concerns), so our need to upgrade to a 32 channel unit gives me the perfect excuse to ditch Hikvision and our current NVR.\n Does anyone have any recommendations for an NVR that works with modern web standards, can be fully managed without specialized software (or at the very least uses software that's not stuck with Windows 98 security practices) and has basic motion-triggered recording features?\n Also, we have a number of cameras we don't want to replace just yet, so ONVIF compatibility is a must-have (though I imagine that's fairly standard at this point).\n EDIT: I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised by all the software-based recommendations. On the one-hand, it makes sense that a pure software solution would offer the best features and widest camera compatibility. On the other, I'm really disappointed at the idea that there's so few decent turn-key appliances out there.\n    submitted by    /u/jmbpiano  \n [link]   [comments]",

If your monthly downloads exceed 100 TB, then your use case is not a good fit. \n  \nSuppose storing 50GB on the Pay-Go plan. I understand I'll be charged for 1TB (a minimum monthly charge associated with 1 TB of active storage). How about the egress regulation? Will I have up to 1TB egress capacity?

Prior to mgirate any users, I tested with my own account and set a deny permission on the license.asmx file for my user for read and execute.\n After restarting Word, I did not see my AD RMS templates anymore, which is great because this is what I expected. But instead, it connected to Azure RMS and showed the \"Restricted Access\" and \"Unrestricted Access\" template, as well as previously configured Sensitivity Labels. I did not create a SRV record for redirection, therefore I'm also wondering why it did connect to Azure RMS.\n I reverted the permission change on the license.asmx file and included my user again to read the file. I can verify this by opening the URL in the browser. I also deleted the MSIP folder in %localdappdata% and removed everything from the registry, that points to <GUID.aadrm.com>. Office is still connecting everytime to Azure RMS instead of my internal AD RMS server.

          "description": "Hello\n The latest march security update (Security Update for Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016) is causing an issue with my IIS.\n As soon as I install it a new DLL gets added \"sprequestfilteringmodule.dll\" and the IIS becomes unreachable (503 error). What's interesting upon further investigation is that the WSUS Application Pool can't be started (no error message is shown, it just immediatly stopps again). The WAS Service is up and running though. In the Event Viewer, there are errors from the WAS Service with the Event ID 5002. A restart didn't help, the server had to be restored in order to get the IIS fast online again. More info to the server: It's a Windows 2012 R2 Server running SharePoint 2013 and the IIS. Has anyone encountered a similiar problem with the March Update or maybe even found a solution?

It is a medium-sized company with about 30 employees.\n All employees work on a Windows Server 2019 terminal server and have a Microsoft 365 Business Basic license. Teams has the latest updates.\n At the beginning of the Corona Pandemic, the Teams-Free licenses were rolled out as a test. Everything has now been migrated to Microsoft 365 and the users have full licenses that also include the use of teams.\n Now the problem, which affects a part of the users, about a third: Teams ALWAYS logs in with the old \"Free\" account and does not recognize the assigned license. Logging out and back in manually doesn't help either. In the free account, an old database is listed up to the end of 2020, everything after that (since using the O365 licenses) seems to be in a kind of different profile that is not loaded.\n I have already reinstalled Teams, assigned / withdrawn the Teams Exploratory license from all users as a test and deleted the Teams cache under %appdata%/Microsoft/Teams.\n If the user logs into Teams via office.com, everything works as it should and the correct content and chats are displayed, the problem ONLY affects the local client.\n Do you have any idea?

Then imagine you also have M365 in parallel, as contoso.com and it is in use for keeping track of M365 licenses, which is no biggie, but also for auth for some third party services, which becomes a massive PITA if it breaks. \n Now picture a world where you want the two to work together. Now, if someone who gets paid a lot more than me hadn't gone in and just manually created accounts for everyone in 365 and had instead used aad connect it'd be pretty simple and my life would be easier. But that was not to be. I can't just do the needful, make a new upn suffix and have sync magically just work. \n Can I map existing on prem AD users to 365 users with aadsync? And the PCs too, I guess, although while they[re there they're not really there, y'know? Ultimately, we're wanting to keep a couple AD servers on prem because it is just so dang easy to use (especially as an auth provider for a lot of internal stuff) but because everyone else is using cloud then we are too.

My Dell E6410 worked reliably with a proprietary dock, but my Dell XPS 13 with a Thunderbolt dock had endless issues with detection. Even after multiple driver downloads and fresh Windows installs, problems persisted with sound and monitor detection.\n I then switched to an HP EliteBook X360 with a USB C dock, which worked well until I hit limitations with monitor resolution. I replaced that with a Startech Thunderbolt 3 dock, which generally worked fine but occasionally required unplugging and replugging after sleep mode.\n Now, with my Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 5, I use a ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 dock for Workstations. While I can remove my laptop from the dock without issue, returning it to the dock requires a hard reboot. And when the laptop goes to sleep, waking it up is often hit or miss, with only one screen coming up or no keyboard function.\n It's frustrating to deal with these issues, and I know I'm not alone - I constantly hear from my users with similar problems on their devices, including Microsoft Surface Laptops with both Surface Docks and universal docks. It's been over half a decade since USB C docks became the standard and there seems to be little improvement from manufacturers.

So I told the President we needed software that provided all the functions for the relevant departments, and managed to find an open-source and well supported software for that.\n I presented it to the relevant sectors of the company and they basically didn't like it, saying it would be \"too difficult\" to adjust to using it. I tried again, and they said the application sucks without even so much as touching it. Talked to the President and he insisted we must use it. Scheduled training this morning, no one showed up.\n I'm not sure what these people want to be honest. No way I'm going to be responsible for operating the software too, it's not even my function, I just provided them the software. They dead-on said they didn't like it and want to go back to the way it was before, i.e. doing everything on paper.

The typical infra for an app is two servers with redundancy (keepalived, HeartBeat...).\n This means one tool = at least 2 servers + some networking and one small team for maintenance (often 1-3 people). \n For the context, we don't do cloud providers (sensitive data) and we don't have to handle a lot of traffic load (internal tools only).\n When I arrived I suggested to \"centralize\" this as more and more apps were also shipped containerized. So with my team we set up a Kubernetes infra which work very well, and with few servers we are able to host like 10 internal tools.\n My points are : this brings same maintenance for all the apps (common k8s dashboard, procedures...), same backups and disaster recovery system, better security management etc. (I won't teach you all of this I think ^^) \n But the thing is : before all of this, there was very few service interruptions, and when it happened it had impact on one tools only. The k8s infra is simpler and more powerful, we had no interruption in one year. Last week, we had a stupid issue with a certificate in the CNI that interrupted all the cluster for one day (the k8s expert were not on site this day). \n This event created a bit of a debate about migrating legacy apps to k8s, am I still on the right path ?

Pool B has nothing moved onto it yet so I assume that's why it's reporting as virtually empty.\n I've read through the supporting documentation and followed to the letter with creating the disk group and volume.

          "description": "Hey guys!\n I have been trying to get iDRAC up and running recently, but it has been driving me crazy and would love a little help if any one could!\n ​\n A bit of background:\n I have have an old Dell PowerEdge C2100 I have had for a little over two years. I have never updated the BIOS or iDRAC firmware since I have had it, as I thought that they were probably close to latest possible version being as old as it is. I now have run into an issue with iDRAC as it has become so old no web browser (even internet explorer) wants to interact with it with the exception of my IOS devices (I assume safari is very leanient on older TLS protocols when accepting the risk of an invalid cert). After some research I found a reddit post (I can't find it but if I do i'll link it here) about how they bricked theirs by not first updating to 1.65.66 and now iDRAC doesn't work anymore. I then stumble across another couple posts mentioning that there are at least 4-5 stepped firmware upgrades you must do in order but no one mentions them. I have searched through Dell's site for a couple days now and can only find BIOS firmware and some client exes on the official Dell PowerEdge C2100 downloads page.\n ​\n I guess my questions are, where can I find resources on what major versions I must update to and where can I find the update files for iDRAC? I have heard of a bootable Update ISO that helps get the required updates from the Dell Repository, is that supported for C2100s (I can't find any trace of it).\n ​\n I really appreciate any help, thanks guys!\n    submitted by    /u/robotdjman  \n [link]   [comments]",

Cisco, llumio, Palo Alto, ZScaler, and Perimeter81 are some ZTNA options we recommend. \n Using incident data and internal \"insert insurance company name\" claims data, we identify the propensity of cyber incidents based on company size (revenue), industry, and VPN Solution in place. An interesting stat that came out of our analysis was organizations using this VPN solution (Fortinet Fortigate) are 3x more likely to have a security incident. In other words, \"insert insurance company name\" predictive risk model has observed more instances of ransomware attacks at organizations utilizing this VPN solution. \n  \nWe are having internal talks now to decide what to do, but moving providers is one of them.

From what I can tell so far, the PowerShell script makes a legit-looking Windows message box pop up on your screen, telling you to call a toll-free number. Dial the number and you are cheerfully greeted by a foreign call center that will be more than happy to help you resolve all your issues. You know how it works from there ...\n All jokes aside about logmein - the fact that this URL has been around for about 10 years and organically pops up in Google search is disturbing.\n Who the hell would type a dash in the URL? No one. That's not how they get you. Because the address bar in your browser is also a search box, many people tend to type in the name of a website, and then click on the website URL in the search results. (Call it lazy or dumb or genius, but I can't tell you how many times I watch people type 'youtube' and press Enter, only to then click on youtube.com in the search results).

I set them up with a E3 license to do so. When they first went to send encrypted emails, Outlook said that Information Protection was not enabled on their tenant. I used Powershell to enable and now they can send out encrypted emails.\n The issue is, instead of the email arriving where they can open it in a browser with a code... they get an email that requires the Information protection viewer and a Microsoft account.\n This is obviously to much for most recipients to be able to handle (I know... trust me... I know...).\n Here is the thing, when I send an encrypted email out of our organization it arrives in the code/web format.

It was pretty tool agnostic, and served me well for a number of years. Though I learned I needed to CYA more than most people would by archiving more stuff than most people would. I used a modified version of it for years with a decent amount of success with only a minimal of stuff falling through the cracks.\n I looked at a few other systems, such as Pomodoro, and one other one I can't recall.\n Last night, I started reading \"Getting Results the Agile Way\" written by J.D. Meier, who works at Microsoft. Many people praised it as an excellent time management strategy, and either a good replacement for GTD or a nice complement to GTD. I don't want to get too deep in the weeds on this, but a lot of his guiding principals just DO NOT work for me. His methodology is not about Agile project management, it's more about being agile in how you manage your work.\n At work, we're HEAVILY focused on implementing Agile. For my day-to-day work, it's been a COMPLETE AND UTTER failure. For all my project work, it's also been an utter disaster, mostly because I don't work on any custom development projects. It's all infrastructure upgrade stuff and COTS upgrades.\n I can obviously continue to use my hybrid method.

For some reason the original domain user account got removed from the system a while ago and re-added and - I think for that reason - it has a different SID now. Now, there are still files in that old SID's $Recycle.bin and I was asked to recover all of them to their original location. Those files are all still there, I can see them with WinDirStat.\n Now my first instinct was, restoring files that are still in the $Recycle.Bin shouldn't be too hard, right? I mean, they are all still on the drive. But damn, I'm doing research for hours now on how to do it and can't find a way. Luckily it's a VM, so first thing I did was taking a snapshot, so nothing can go wrong when I toy around with the filesystem.\n Opening the folder in Explorer with my Domain-User Account of course is not helping since the files are tied to a different user.The next thing I tried was simply to rename the Recycle Bin subfolder, that includes the old SID as a folder name, to my SID. After I log into my user account then, Windows now tells me my Recycle Bin is corrupted and asks if I want to delete it. So, I reverted to my snapshot.\n There are tons of tools out there that can recover deleted files from NTFS, but seemingly no tools to recover still existing files from the recycler?\n    submitted by    /u/BFYoda  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, \n we are looking for a web-based tool for a self-management of AD-groups. Has anyone an advice? \n To give some background: We use Linux clients company wide. So any windows-based tool is impossible or needs further expenses we would like to avoid.\n The process is that IT creates the AD-group and defines an owner. The owner (can be everyone in the company) has to check/set members. So the tool should allow to resolve nested-groups to actual people/member. The process of checking the members and the overall requirement of the AD-group itself is part of the compliance processes and belongs to the group owner.\n Right now it's resolved over tickets to the IT which blocks way too much time on the admin side. \n Our idea is a web-tool which gives all the AD-groups belonging to the owner in a view where they can see the members and add/delete them from the group. Deleting/creating the group shall still be part of IT.\n    submitted by    /u/flotey  \n [link]   [comments]",

Fortunately the team thar needed to address the ticket doesn't sit in the office so headed over to my desk to expedite. (I am the head of the department with a couple levels between me and the support desk)\n I asked him if he had a ticket in, and he said \"yes but need this right away for something I am doing for the CEO.\"\n I informed him, \"if you put in a ticket our typical SLA is a day or two. It will be worked based on urgency.\"\n \"Well can you check the status?\"\n \"I assure you if you put the ticket it then if is in the queue and will be processed.\"\n He left dejected and huff, \"I don't understand why it takes a couple of days to just push some buttons.\"\n I always appreciate the arrogance of people who think they can name drops and bully their way into the front of the line. That isn't our company culture and I know the CEO well enough to know the would be upset if they knew I let this guy skip in line.\n For what's is worth, I reviewed what they were asking for and it isn't something that will be approved anyway. Somebody showed him a beta system that isn't production ready and now he is demanding access--he isn't a beta tester for the system and his desire is to use it for production use.\n Icing on the cake, one of my team members picked up the ticket about an hour after it was submitted and made multiple attempts to reach the manager and couldn't get a response back from them today.

I see jobs for Heads of IT, IT director and IT manager at salaries between 25k and 150k.\n Now I get there is should be a vast difference in capability between the bottom and top and companies have a different requirements and risk acceptance factors.\n However I will give the example I worked at a hospice for 50k and they wanted me to hire infrastructure engineers at 23k which was just not possible for competent ones anyway. I explained the risks of hiring people that needed training and asked tounge in cheek why don’t we hire doctors without the experience to perform the role to save money? Well the answer is that’s illegal and we have to pay going rate.\n So my question in a roundabout way is IT salaries so out of Wack because there is no professional accredited body that makes doing IT work illegal without.\n Would it actually benefit IT to have such a body even just for government work.

Sounds a lot to me like they’re trying to con people into their new pricing scheme before everyone jumps ship when Broadcom fully takes over and destroys their product just like they have for everything else. I was trying to remain hopeful that maybe this time it would be different but…Broadcom hasn’t even fully taken over yet and they’ve already almost doubled my licensing cost per year with this new scheme, what a scam. I got a laugh when I got the cautionary reminder at the end of the email “the price can be locked in year over year with VSphere+, but the price can’t be guaranteed when you’re up for renewal next year if you don’t go with the proposed pricing”. \n Needless to say, I’m going to talk to my team about it all but I believe we’re are going to be in the market for something else.

          "description": "We recently had a switch in our website hosting provider and I'm hitting my head against the wall on what I'm missing here. Everything works externally, but we have a split-brain DNS setup in our internal network. It's been set up that way for a long time and it's not something I can completely remove unfortunately, at least not right now.\n So externally, www.domain.com resolves and is proxied through Cloudflare and life is good. (see screenshot in attached album)\n Internally, however, is where things aren't currently working. Our previous hosting provider had a trusted CA issued cert installed on the origin server, and so we could simply point our internal DNS to the same public IP that CF was pointed to and everything would work fine. This new hosting provider insists on having a self signed cert on their side however. Why this is I'm still trying to figure out in my continued discussions with them, but for now that's what we've got and obviously that causes issues with 'site unsecure' warnings if we set it up like we had done before.\n So what I was trying to do is simply point our internal DNS to the CF proxied route, and per here and here I was under the impression I could simply create a CNAME entry for www.domain.com and point it to www.domain.com.cdn.cloudflare.net. (see screenshot in attached album). But clearly I'm still missing something because even with that things aren't working - Chrome gives an \"ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED\" error even though NSLOOKUP seems to resolve to the CF IP's just fine (again, see screenshots in attached album). \n Anyone dealt with a similar issue before?

          "description": "So you may have seen my post a few weeks ago about cyber insurance deeming MFA on every single admin device, network equipment, accounts etc. We’re slowly working down our list of stuff that we need to action, but as I am not that clued up on network, our manager is the one responsible for the network and network switches across all our offices. Some of these switches are 10-20 years old, and absolutely cannot support any form of MFA, even RADIUS. The rest of the team saw this as a great opportunity for a use case to replace these old switches with something more modern and would be compliant with our requirements. Our manager has grown to have a bit of a reputation within the team of just being lazy, and only wants to touch what he knows. Whilst our insurance deems it a requirement to protect these switches with MFA, the argument we got back was “what are they going to do? Look what device is plugged in?”\n Apart from the fact these switches are almost 20 year old so have obvious security flaws in them anyway, what would the worst case scenario be if someone malicious had access to a switch within a network?\n    submitted by    /u/MiniMica  \n [link]   [comments]",

The admin reports policy so we can use the reports at confit.microsoft.com\n We hit go and watched with glee as the admin report went from 0% to around 90%. Never got to 100.. and forgot about it all as we moved to more important things.\n Now I’m reviewing our settings and status and I’ve found a couple of weird things\n Firstly some users have moved their folders into random folders, or so it would seem, like into the sub folder of some obscure project. Too few to be a mis configuration, too many for it to be accidental drag and drops.\n Secondly the admin reports have gone backwards, sitting at 75% or so\n Has anyone else had these experiences?

I found out its the board and the cpu that died and since Dell emailed back telling me that theres nothing they'll do because it was a few month after the warranty ended and fixing would cost as much as buying it new any board/cpu I should know that would fit right with the components I already have?

Let's call them:\n CompanyOnPrem. com\n CompanyCloud. com\n The embedded ID authenticates against CompanyOnPrem. com\\account1. This account is synchronized with AzureAD so it has the correct rights in CompanyCloud, but of course the programs won't install because CompanyOnPrem is also embedded in the install file. \n HOWEVER! If I open anything (run CMD as a different user/admin) on the device using the CompanyCloud as the domain just once, now all the install files work perfectly.\n To summarized: \n File has CompanyOnPrem. com\\account1 embedded & will not install. \n Open CMD as account1@CompanyCloud. com and close it. Now all install files work fine. \n It's like running it once is creating a pointer or a DNS rescored that redirects the authentication - which is actually great for us. \n Does anyone know specifically what is happening and where these credentials are stored?\n    submitted by    /u/Cullingsong  \n [link]   [comments]",

Later still they stopped using the hostnames the cnames referenced and we never got final authorization to terminate the cnames. \n Last month a flurry spam sent by ip addresses authorized by someone who set up an spf record the cnames now pointed at got sent out.

          "description": "This is an odd request, but please hear me out. My company provides control panels with very small (like 2-3 device) isolated TCP/IP networks. Occasionally, a device needs to be serviced by connecting a laptop with programming software installed. This software interacts over a TCP/IP connection with the devices in the panel. The software is expensive, difficult to install, and difficult to license. It is not something we could just send an installer to our customers to install on a local laptop, most of the time. Furthermore, asking to remote into a customer's machine would be seen as unprofessional in this industry.\n I may post a similar question on /r/plc where I normally hang out, but I am looking for something more than the current ways I've seen/done this:\n  \nVERY EXPENSIVE - drive or fly to the site just to plug in an ethernet cable to the laptop with the right software on it.\n MEDIUM EXPENSE - send a laptop with the software installed to site with instructions for site personnel to get it connected to the panel's switch. This ties up a full set of software licenses (this can be 5 figure licenses)\n MEDIUM EXPENSE - send or permanently install a dedicated cellular VPN box (usually netbiter, eWon or Secomea) out that puts the engineer's licensed laptop on the panel's network\n LOWEST EXPENSE - if the customer has the right combination of competency and flexibility in their IT dept, set up VPN access to the network \n  \nOk, so here's where I'm wondering if there's a 5th option. Is there a way to set up a laptop that just functions as a VPN server, rather than client. Like, is there a cisco or whatever program I can install on a win10/11 laptop that, when running, allows remote vpn clients to access the laptop's local network? \n All of the above is typically done as supervised, extremely temporary connections to these systems. I am aware these all represent security risks except #1. Please refrain from chastising my industry for our security practices.\n    submitted by    /u/InstAndControl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I work maybe 6-7h each day, really not that much compared to what I read from other guys in this sub. However during that time I am hyper focused. The only break that I take is 30 minutes for lunch, and I mean really no other break at all. I don’t kick back in my seat, take care of personal stuff or get up to walk around the room for a bit. Instead I jump from one task to the next, whether that’s a meeting, monitoring alert, ticket, project, chat message, email, you name it. The stimulation is just so intense that I can’t get out once I’m in. What I don’t realize during that time is that I’m completely overstimulating by brain. I don’t give it time to process anything. So once I stop working my mind starts racing about everything I touched throughout the workday. I go over the meeting in my head, I think about if I forgot something on the ticket I worked on, if the next steps for the project are correct, etc. I go to bed with these thoughts and I wake up with them. Only after about 2 days of not working (typically on Sundays or today after a holiday) the thoughts start to slow down. This really sucks because I am not fully present with my family unless I’m on holiday and generally I’m just burning myself out. I know what I shouldn’t be doing but I just can’t stop it. I tried a couple of things to mitigate that:\n  \nA physical alert on my desk which goes off after 2h to remind me to get up (which I happily ignore once I’m into the vortex)\n A tool on my computer which actually blocks the screen for 5 minutes to force a break (which annoyed me too much when I was deep into something or in a meeting)\n Countless of post-its to remind me of breaks (which you guessed it, I ignore)\n  \nHave any of you experienced the same and found a solution to this?\n PS: I should mention that neither my boss or any external factor are forcing this behavior on me. While I had jobs in the past where that was the case, today it’s not.\n    submitted by    /u/Puzzles9193  \n [link]   [comments]",

MX->Barracuda->O365.\n The only inbound connector we have is scoped to only accept mail from Barracuda IPs.\n Mail Rule to set the SCL to -1 when mail is received from Barracuda IPs to ensure O365 scanning is bypassed.\n We recently upgraded our Microsoft Licensing which allows additional email security on the O365 Side. \n While Barracuda does a pretty good job at keeping the bad-guys away, I'm considering layering *some* of the scanning/security such that any email that comes into our organization, first passes through Barracuda for Scans, then an additional scan is done at the O365 level before delivering to the user mailbox.\n Seeing the recommendation is to enable Enhanced Filtering.\n https://campus.barracuda.com/product/emailgatewaydefense/doc/96023002/enhanced-connectors-vs-mail-flow-rules-for-spam-filtering/\n ​\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/enhanced-filtering-for-connectors#what-happens-when-you-enable-enhanced-filtering-for-connectors\n ​\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-mail-flow-using-third-party-cloud#scenario-1---mx-record-points-to-third-party-spam-filtering\n ​\n I'm assuming this is a modification to the existing inbound connector to enable Skip Listing, and the SkipIPs then become a list of IPs that Barracuda uses - essentially allowing us to keep the scoping in place for the connector to only allow Barracuda IPs. We would then 'remove' the SCL-1 rule.\n While this might come with some additional management - I can see the benefits of having an integrated filter in place (Impersonation etc etc).\n Anyone else setup this way?

I was hired to manage a Windows environment and some small Azure related projects. Down the road last year, a few key people in the company quit and I had to step up to take more responsibilities especially for managing other cloud environments (AWS/Linux and some DevOps) and I was told at that time that they'll look into getting a raise for me. I also got a few Azure/AWS certs and spent many extra hours to learn and manage these environments. Although, besides the regular 5% annual raise, there haven't been any discussions around the raise. I really enjoy my time working here but I have been told by others to start looking somewhere else but my experience has been very good with the company, and also having imposter syndrome to apply elsewhere. Would like some advice on where to go from here. Thanks! Location: ON, CA. Sal: C$60k\n    submitted by    /u/informate11  \n [link]   [comments]",

Early in my career, I was advised to never bother, and just use nano instead, which works enough like a regular text editor that anyone can use it with no special training. \n The problem is I now catch a lot side glances from the career Linux guys for using nano. The people who have primarily worked in Linux all seem to be VI guys.\n I haven't really put effort into learning it, my vi knowledge is basically :q! If I accidentally open it.\n What do you guys think, is it actually something worth learning, or is it just a preference thing? Alternately, is it worth doing just as a marker for being a Linux pro?\n    submitted by    /u/DJDoubleDave  \n [link]   [comments]",

For those that don't, it is a security awareness training program that helps users to take extra precautions when it come to opening emails and trickery of phishing and whatnot. \n When we sent out a test campaign, and a user falls for it, they user will get a training class assigned to them where they'll have to watch it and take a quiz helping them not fall for it again in the future. \n We started this about a year ago, but lately we have users who get supper offended when they fall for one the campaigns that get sent to them and get really upset that they have to do the class and quiz. It is starting to really piss me off. They're thanking we (IT) purposely are trying to make them fall for it so we can give them a shitty day. That isn't the case. We are better safe than sorry. \n What I need help with is who can draft me a crafty email explaining how it isn't us against them and that this tool is there to help us all take extra precautions rather than feeling that IT is trying to make you fall for those tests. \n Because as I am drafting the email, I finding it to be in a very pissed off tone which is making me hesitant to send it to the whole company.

All DCs support only \"RC4, AES 128, AES 256\" encryption types (no DES). \n Some AD accounts (mostly computer objects for Linux systems with Centrify agent installed) support only \"DES, RC4\".\n Some other accounts (also Centrify systems) support \"DES, RC4, AES128, AES256\". The rest (vast majority Windows systems, nothing lower than W2K12R2/Win10) of accounts don't support DES at all. \n Question 1: Without the DCs supporting for DES, is having \"DES\" as a supported type on a bunch of computer objects an actual risk item? We are logging everything into Splunk and there are zero events indicating DES is in use. These accounts turned up in an internal audit, but the actual risk seems non-existent. We will remediate them anyway but I'm wanting to be clear on the risk for management discussions. \n Question 2: Right now in Splunk I see AES in use, but also RC4 being used, even involving systems that have support for AES128 and AES256. I think I've read that once we switch to W2K19 DCs this behavior will change, and the DCs will start negotiating with the highest encryption level available. Is that accurate?

Obviously we've been adding the mail servers into the block lists along with the domains as they come in.\n We've had KnowBe4 running campaigns for years now, so our end users knew what to do (don't open anything, report it, etc.). We sent out an email to all users, just informing them of what is happening, and to be vigilant.\n I don't think much more can be done to prevent this, other than keep up training for users, keep them informed of threats (as we've done).\n All the mail servers aren't within our country and we don't do much business outside of this country, so I could restrict all inbound mail just to our country (then just allow through what's need when it's needed).\n I have got a support case open with our Email Gateway provider, as a few of these emails used the name of end users and should of been caught by \"Impersonation Prevention\" but it marked them as \"Legitimate\".\n Any suggestions?

I have been tasked with creating an automatic warranty checker for Dell servers, and I am hoping to use Nagios to achieve this. I have found an API for Nagios that was created in 2012, but unfortunately, it is no longer functional. I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with creating a Dell server warranty checker using Nagios and would be able to offer any guidance.\n The objective of this project is to create a system that will allow Nagios to self-check the Dell website by service tag and display the warranty status of the server in Nagios, or alternatively, send an email notification. This would help us keep track of the warranty status of our servers and allow us to take action before the warranty expires.\n I would appreciate any help or guidance on this matter, whether it be through pointing me in the direction of helpful resources, providing suggestions on how to tackle this project, or sharing personal experiences with similar projects.\n Thank you in advance for your assistance!\n    submitted by    /u/RelativeStatement341  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since last Week users complaining that they cant open some PDF Files. I got the ticket now from my colleague to help him.\n I analyzed the problem and found that all files that wont work have the DataStream ZoneIdentifier tag set that they are from the internet and could harm the system. If i rightclick the file it show the info box \"this file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer\".\n So far so good. If i click on allow and therefore remove the Zone Identifier the File opens with a double click. \n I checked other file types aswell. The same Problem with word files, and image files. So its not a application problem. It seems to be a windows problem.\n If i change the internetoptions-> security -> Internet Zone -> Start unsecure applications and files : from confirm (recommended) -> to activate (not secure) the problem is gone also. But i dont like to change this setting.\n What could cause this problem? Can you help me?\n    submitted by    /u/jimstar95  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was ready to decommission the final 2012R2 DC but when testing via a shutdown, I experienced an outage. \n Our intranet, hosted on Google Cloud on Ubuntu, requires a sign in with an active directory credential to access (email address + password via LDAP). Despite changing the IP of the VM's DNS server to match our new DC's (one on GCP and one on prem), the moment I turn off the old DC is the moment authentication on this server fails, and staff instead get an \"Internal Server Error\" page from apache. \n Digging into the apache config, I can see the authentication is using LDAP, with the following section;\n ## Active Directory AuthBasicProvider ldap AuthLdapBindDN readonly@int.domain.net AuthLdapBindPassword AuthLdapBindURL ldap://int.domain.net:3268/?userPrincipleName?sub \n Three things about this;\n 1 - Even though the AD account it's using to authenticate has the absolute minimum access, I don't like how the password is stored in plain text. Is this a requirement for such a setup?\n 2 - What configures that ldap:// and how do I get it to point to the new DC's? Is this configured vía our public DNS instead? Or is not DNS at all?? \n 3 - Doing some digging online I discovered that it's possible to \"automatically authenticate\" via their user account if the credentials match (meaning they don't have to enter them in).

They have passed along a job opportunity to be the IT Manager at a Non Profit for me to look at. I would be the sole IT person onsite and the description lists everything from on boarding new employees for training to writing and implementing policy. Apparently there is a significant level of vendors leveraged right now, but it still seems as though the job might be punching a bit above it's weight class in terms of expectations and salary. The network size is approximately 100 end user devices according to the recruiter (computers). \n What are people's experiences working in an environment like this? Is there a chance it could be good? Or will it be an extremely overworked shit show? \n I will also add I have previously been a network admin and systems engineer and feel as though my only weak point skillset wise will be the HIPPA stuff. I do have experience working in a heavily controlled and audited environment so I think it will be more so based around learning the new intricacies VS entirely new concepts. In the listing they specifically call out that they will send people to training to ensure their skillset stays sharp. \n The salary is more than livable (85k) as it will be a great resume builder and it's similiar to my current role as an engineer.

          "description": "Hi guys,\n We have been having some issues lately with outlook losing connection for some people in the company. It just sometimes loses connection randomly, and it's not really something people notice right away, so sometimes an e-mail will just be stuck for a whole day. So a lot of people have swapped to browser since the issue does not seem to appear there.\n Some more info on the issue.\n There can be days between occurrence\n It seems the only way to fix this is restarting the pc.\n Multiple people are impacted (Two guys with completely new workstations)\n ​\n I've tried all the common fixes.\n Check Connectivity and Mailbox Server Status. The first thing to do is check your system's network status.\n Check Work Offline Status.\n Restart Outlook in Safe Mode\n Fix Certificate Issue\n Create New Outlook Profile.\n Rebuild Outlook Data File.\n ​\n I've been going through a SaRA Advanced Diagnostic file and found this event log. I was thinking the credentials being rejected might be causing some of the issues.\n The BITS service provided job credentials in response to the UNIDENTIFIED authentication challenge from the Outlook.office365.com server for the microsoft Outlook offline address book xxxxxxxxxxxx transfer job that is associated with the following URL:/OAB/xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/oab.xml. The credentials for the S-1-5-21-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx user were rejected.\n ​\n If anyone has had this issue before, or might know a fix. Please guide me. All help is appreciated.\n ​\n Cheers guys\n    submitted by    /u/Savings_Produce2326  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am working on turning it into a truenas box but keep running into an issue. I want to add a dual 10g nic and 8 port sata card in the spare ports on the riser card. My issue is that they are not being recognized. The lights come on but they are not seen in bios or truenas. There was already a sata card installed in one of the ports that work but adding anything new does not seem to work. That card was already there. I am new to riser cards and unsure what to do next. Below are some troubleshooting steps I have taken.\n  \nSwap in the new sata card into the working port..... guess what... it works.... so I know that slot accepts anything. The other slots do not work on that riser card.\n \nReset bios... nothing changed. The other riser card is not accepting anything. Still just that 1 slot on that 1 riser card.\n \nEnabled and disabled almost everything in bios. It never sees the new card on any of the other slots on that riser card or the other riser card. Just that one slot on that one riser card.\n \n Thank you for any help... I want this to replace my current usb hard drives asap...\n Edit 1: in the bios it talks about 2a and 2c being enabled.

          "description": "Like the title says I have a set of workstations at work with an unusual setup. These workstations are a 911 dispatch center and each station consists of 3 separate PCs, 5 monitors (2 PCs with 2 each nad the 3rd with just 1 monitor), all connected together with a type of KVM switch that allows users to control each machine with just one keyboard and mouse and have the desktops act as if they are all on one machine.\n The KVM device is called an Adder CCS controller and the way it functions is each machine is connected to this controller via USB and the kb/mouse connect to it. The controller allows you to move the mouse from one screen to another but in doing so switches the input of both kb & mouse to the corresponding PC. The reason why we have this odd setup instead of just consolidating the functions to one PC is that we do not own two of the PCs as they are provided by external entities to be used with their specific software product.\n This all works perfectly fine on 3 of the 4 stations but the 4th has had literally everything replaced and it continued to cause the mouse to randomly jump around, the browser windows to refresh or close and lose any info that had bene typed in, and other odd ball issues. Currently we have it setup where the one PC that had the odd issues completely separated from the controller and other systems but this is not ideal as it requires the use of two sets of kb/mouse.\n Has anyone used a setup like this before and if so do you have a recommendation for a replacement product? A traditional KVM or USB splitter is not an option as they cannot rely on needing to use a button to switch inputs, nor is a USB hub as they need the kb/mouse to only function on one screen at a time.\n So far the only thing I have been able to find is software products but we would prefer not to use that and stick with a hardware physical connection.\n    submitted by    /u/fuzzusmaximus  \n [link]   [comments]",

When talking to the users, we're finding that they're not clicking on anything in the emails, but still failing the click through test. If it was just a handful, we'd say \"users be users\", but they swear up and down they're not, and when we look in KnowBe4, the logged IP isn't from our range and shows as owned by MS.

There's a view among the exec team that having someone manually go through the shared drives for each department would be too time-consuming and that there's a technological approach that would eliminate most of the grunt work by automatically categorising the various files (i.e. by identifying PII content, for example).\n I know there are tools that can do this - we've looked at them in the past - but my take is that the grunt work still needs to be done. All you've really done is come up with a way to prioritise what you look at first.\n - someone needs to check the files that are identified as PII to confirm that they contain PII.\n - someone needs to check the files that haven't been identified as PII to confirm that they don't contain PII.\n In both cases someone needs to decide whether or not the files need to be kept, or if they need to be deleted in line with data retention policies.\n Am I thinking about this the wrong way?

So, fine, I got a bunch and then supplemented that with the Juniper MIBs I could find from LibreNMS's GitHub.\n After doing that the 1.3.6.1.2.1 OIDs resolve, but the enterprise OIDs (1.3.6.1.4.1) still don't -- I see this:\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.8.5.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.12.2.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00\n The SNMPWALK command I'm using is:\n snmpwalk -M \"C:\\MIBs\" -v2c -c myjunipercommunitystring the.firewall.ip.address \"1\"\n Any insight on this would be hugely appreciated.

I took over a very small company where I need to setup all PCs and accounts from scratch, since the existing setup is horrible.\n The situation: I have 5 work stations that are shared by many employees. They do not need own users, just an \"employee\" user to access office and the NAS, because they are in general not doing typical office work. So no individual mails, onedrive, teams, etc necessary. \n If you could create this from scratch how would you do it?\n I thought about getting 5 win11 pro licenses and 5 device licences for office 2021 and then create the same local users (Admin and employee) on every device. Could I also create those users in Azure ad and manage them there, so I do not have to create the users on each device individually? How can I setup the printers for everybody without doing this manually on every pc? What is needed and are there any monthly costs to expect?\n Looking forward to hear from your experiences and recommendations!\n    submitted by    /u/toto290  \n [link]   [comments]",

When we moved in we installed a small wall mount enclosure with a lock for our equipment in that room. It is well marked that it is our property.\n About two year ago we found somebody popped the lock and installed their own equipment in our cabinet. We rose hell with the landlord and got it removed.\n Fast forward a couple month the same thing happened and we suspected it was the carrier tech but couldn't prove it. Since we are closest to the room our business lead on-site is often asked to allow service people in the room and we inform him under no condition should any carriers ever be given non-escorted access.\n A few weeks later we get a call that a carrier tech showed up unannounced on a Friday afternoon. He was informed we would be happy to schedule to have him return on Monday to be a good neighbor but if they couldn't escort him we didn't have time. They tech was pissed.\n When he returned the next week he still wasn't happy. Now we are in a small market so there are not a lot of local techs so we will run into him over and over....he doesn't provide service with a smile.\n Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and we have power outage and telecom issues. We arrive at the facility and find someone popped our lock again and unplugged the fiber from just our equipment (none of our neighbors).\n Before this incident the landlord refused to allow us to put our own surveillance on this common space. After explaining to him we would hold his company liable for any business losses due to their negligence to secure our equipment in a shared space we finally have a camera installed. I'm low key hoping the person who has been doing this is the person we think--we will have video evidence this time to take action.\n I hate having shared equipment closets of any type.\n    submitted by    /u/grepzilla  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each phone draws about 3W, though each advertises to the switch that it needs up to 7W.\n However, powering more than 5 phones simultaneously results in a complete POE failure. The instant a sixth device is plugged in, all POE goes completely offline. None of the phones advertise that they're pulling more than 3.7W at the time of failure. Looking at the power status page for the Meraki switch shows that it's using 13.9 W of 1612 W (???) available prior to its failure.\n I've contacted Meraki support, and they thought it was \"weird\" that the switch shows 1612 W available, but they haven't provided any tips or thoughts on why that is. Thinking the switch was defective, I replaced it with another Meraki 120-48FP, but the exact same problem occurs. I've experimented with different ports (including powering up the devices in different order), but the same problem occurs. \n The TL;DR version: Any five POE phones can be active, but the instant I power up a sixth POE phone, all POE goes offline.\n Has anyone seen this or something similar to it?

          "description": "Reflecting on my career one truth has always emerged: \"The harder I worked, the more they took me for granted.\"\n It seems counter-intuitive, frustrating and demoralizing, so why is it?\n Well, simply put: They get used to it. When you consistently deliver high-quality work or go above and beyond what's expected, it can become the new norm. People may come to expect this level of effort from you without recognizing or acknowledging it.\n Another reason is that people may not realize how much effort you're putting in. If you're not vocal about your accomplishments or don't receive regular feedback or recognition, others may not be aware of the extent of your hard work.\n And lastly, you're running around all stressed out and scaring the commoners. Relax, everyone likes Tony, the IT guy who moves like a sloth, and doesn't react to anything, we love Tony! But then there's Marc, running around, always walking fast in the hallways, slow down Marc! His clothes are a little too tight, go up a size Marc, it's okay, relax.\n So what can you do about it? The answer is obvious, don't give so much, pull back a little. Now mind you, and put down the pitchforks, I'm speaking to my IT heroes out there, the ones who go above and beyond, answer the phone during Thanksgiving dinner, or Saturday morning at 2am.\n IT admins work in the background, they get no recognition or praise, we work in the shadows, in the server rooms and IDFs where no one can see.\n When things are working, great! \"So, what exactly do you do here again?\" And when things aren't working: \"Hey, are you working on this or what is it you do here exactly?\"\n So relax, and don't be a hero, they don't give a damn either way.\n    submitted by    /u/paperlevel  \n [link]   [comments]",

That said, I am running into issues with a boss ask: Separate Domain Admin level ability (eg: GPO changes, ADUC, etc) from our existing Admin accounts. \n Quick background of our environment:\n  \nLarge enterprise with thousands of accounts and servers globally.\n Currently, privileges are tiered out like: \n Admin Level Accounts, Admin rights on \"high security\" systems (eg:domain controllers, SCCM, core infrastructure, Active Directory / group policy management)\n Server Level Accounts. Admin rights on Utility or Application host boxes. \n Branch Level Accounts. Unprivileged workstation accounts. \n Tiered accounts only have logon rights to their respective Tiered Servers.\n \n Domain Level Servers require MFA for Local/RDP access. Our MFA solution uses federation out to Azure to authenticate. \n  \nNow the ask: What would the best way to split DA functions to its own dedicated account, but will not have admin rights over anything but AD itself. \n My idea was to Remove DA from the existing Admin Level accounts and create a dedicated \"DA-Only\" account that would not have login rights to any server (or only to a utility box), use the existing admin accounts to log into a jumpbox, and utilizing runas to open any tools needed to perform AD administration. That said, I am running into the problem where I cannot restrict the \"DA-Only\" accounts from local and TS login as that prevents that account from any sort of interactive login. \n I would love to know if anyone else has done something like this or could point me in the right direction on how to implement.

In a configuration-as-code model (which will soon be mandated if you are working in the US financial sector), many organizations are necessarily moving to Intune or other \"DevOps\" tools to do post-OS configuration and state management. What these tools lack is bare metal provisioning and native WDS fills this gap perfectly.\n And while I've always been a huge fan of SCCM/MECM, it's doesn't make sense to support that scale of infrastructure just for OSD. Likewise MDT also has a great many extraneous features and is, frankly, not suitable for the enterprise.\n I am aware that you can create a custom PE image that will boot to WDS but recent PE Setup OCs seem to lack some of the command line parameters that were present in earlier versions, and I feat that w/o official boot.wim support, custom PE support cannot be relied upon in a mission critical environment.\n And while third party and even some open source solutions exist (in fact I wrote my own a few years ago), using an MS provisioning tool to deploy MS operating systems is optimal in terms of streamlined support and vendor management.\n I created user feedback item here, Please upvote if you'd like see continued support for WDS.\n    submitted by    /u/1sttec  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't know, if I need a fully blown ticketing system yet, since there won't be too many inquires in the beginning, but something, to create projects with and manage all steps of the way, keeping track of steps in between and also logging all activities, I've written down, without having to manually save them, would be fantastic.\n Keep in mind, my former employer already had all the tools, but they were enterprise solutions for keeping tracks of dozens of customers. \n If you have any recommendations and have been in a similar situation, I would appreciate any and all tips for my future work here.\n Thanks a lot and have a nice week!\n    submitted by    /u/xdernomad  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm posting here in hope some people better educated and more knowledgeable than I am might be able to help with a bit of a technical headache I have!\n I play Rocket League professionally and I'm based in the UK. Rocket League is extremely sensitive to jitter for whatever reason and I'm having a real issue with it at the moment. Unfortunately, playing at a high level requires very low jitter.\n I currently use Zen Internet (FTTP) and have a high-end router and have noticed my routing to the Rocket League servers is pretty bad. Here's a link to a WinMTR showing the issue: Routing\n The first few hops always have pretty bad jitter along them and it's incredibly annoying, resulting in a lot of in-game issues. It gets worse at peak times. \n I have contacted Zen about this issue but they won't — or can't — do anything. I use WTFast to circumvent further bad exchanges and that helps a lot, but there's still significant jitter and I feel this is because the first few hops are still used when routing. If I'm wrong about that, please let me know.\n Ultimately, I'm looking to change ISPs because of this. It's losing me money and time and is negatively affecting my mental health. To my understanding, I can't really know whether the routing of an ISP will be good or not without purchasing it first. What are my options here?\n I'd be very grateful if anyone from the UK can run a WinMTR to the same server and list their ISP alongside.

          "description": "Hi Reddit!\n I'm gonna get straight to the point on this one.\n I work for a large company with 2k+ employees, obviously we have quite a huge load on our HR and Salary department with all these employees. Currently whenever someone needs to hire someone, onboard someone, change an employeement agreement etc they do it via Microsoft forms that are connected to PowerAutomate to send the information to the correct place / inbox, this has been quite chaotic and we are looking into getting a proper \"HR Service management\" or ticketing system for HR and Salary instead.\n We have looked into the Freshservice HR workspace but since Freshservice is built for IT first it makes me quite sceptical, we also need to be able to easily create HR processes for recruitment orders, workpermits and employee changes and this has proven quite troublesome in the Freshservice demo I've worked with setting up. A lot of bugs and the documentation for Fresh leaves a lot to be desired.\n Therefore we are looking at other solutions but it's difficult to find out there, any tips or pointers?\n Our biggest needs are:\n  \nUsers being able to submit tickets to HR, and HR being able to easily view and process said tickets.\n Users being able to order new recruitments, HR then needs to be able to view current ongoing recruitment processes in some sort of list or \"view\" listing all ongoing recruitments.\n Users being able to send in work permits with HR being able to track current workpermits, aswell as being alerted when a work permit is about to expire.\n Integration into Salesforce and Azure is a must.\n All of the above needs to be exported once a month as a .csv to our HR master so it can stay up to date with the changes.\n Bonus if it has support for integration / APIs with Teamtailor.\n  \nThank you very much in advance Reddit, any tips are helpful and very much appreciated.

The company makes all new hires contract to perm and the track record is, if you make it 6 months, you are converted to salary (I have been here for ~2 months). I currently make $80k as a contractor but have little to no benefits to speak of. When converted, the salary is $70k. As a caveat, I am not really enjoying the work and can see why the turnover rate is sky high. \n I have been contacted by a company that I applied for shortly before starting this position for an interview as a system administrator. The company is in the aerospace and defense industry and the programs it supports are very intriguing to me. The role also comes with a top secret security clearance. I would also be getting hired on as a salaried employee with full benefits and a starting salary of $65k. \n My career goal was to become a system administrator and an engineer following that. So I could also see myself moving up or out of the Sys. Admin role within the next 2 years as well (if all goes well of course).

Long story short - we recently had a cyber attack that resulted in us rebuilding our network/servers and we lost a couple of staff along the way who were the ones who usually handled our imaging process. On top of that our software packages have broken links and don't run correctly with the network rebuild, so we're not in good shape.\n The good thing is, most of our staff use the exact same base build on their devices, so if there is a way to clone one good image to multiple devices that are the same model, that would be ideal for this project. We have the software install packages, but manually pushing them can take 2-3 hours per computer and requires a few reboots. We have been lucky thus far to not need to replace a lot of PC's since the outage, and I was able to build several of them as spares to swap out if needed using the manual process.\n I know there are multiple tools out there that do many things, so I am mostly wondering what some recommendations are for something that will get the job done. We do have a couple KVM's so can image multiple at a time - but how do we package a clone of an image to push out, and what does that process look like - especially with joining devices to the domain.\n In my old job at an MSP, we just manually installed everything per device as we had a lot of small companies that requested maybe 2-3 computers at a time on average, so it was not a big deal. Prior to that I worked for a large hospital that had SCCM set up to deploy Windows on PXE boot, which was very nice, but I have no idea how that process was set up.

I was hired into this company last year specifically because they had no one filling the role of Cybersecurity. For a year, most of my security recommendations or critical flags have been met with “that is too much work and we can’t afford to possibly break systems to implement that”. I love the job otherwise and have so much freedom and truly little stress of other tasks or expectations. How do I get over my ego and stay with a company longer?\n EDIT: I didn’t want to spark a debate about the cybersecurity vs sysadmin war. I value people’s time and a business’s right to say no. A few have answered my question perfectly, but the goal here was coaching on being satisfied with a job that has value, but I have a problem when I see need/urgency but leadership sometimes ignores core security for paths of least resistance.\n    submitted by    /u/marknate985  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When I have multiple computers I can create clusters (maybe with a technology like k8s), and with a bit of work, I can be sure to have near 100% service uptime. Meaning no matter what, even if something happens, another computer is going to handle the requests and everything will be 100% transparent to the end user. That's because the service was designed to handle such cases, maybe by running inside docker, allowing state recovery, and whatnot.\n But here I am wondering about cloud services (AWS and Azure for example). If my knowledge is up to date, these guys have big machines (like terabytes of RAM and tens of cores on a single motherboard), and they use a hypervisor to split these into smaller VM, that they can then rent.\n But in such a case, they cannot run a single VM on different computers right ? So what do they do if one of their computer suddenly has a break down ? If their architecture is designed like I described in the previous paragraph, then all the VM on that machine suddenly shutdown, and their services are no longer available ? So there is now way that they can promise near 100% machine uptime ?\n And even if you keep your machine 100% healthy, with zero internet downtime, you have your own generator in case of electric failure, how to you update your hypervisor ? Wouldn't they need a reboot from time to time ? And if you need to change components, how do you move a running VM from one machine to another ?\n I am not a sys admin btw, I do datascience and AI, so way more math and way less programming, but I am deeply interested in how they solved the problem, so don't hesitate to start from the basics, and many thanks for your time.\n    submitted by    /u/prumf  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Edge Sync has always worked fine, bookmarks, etc.\n Suddenly I have all of my existing users still syncing, even if logging into a workstation they have never used before. But somewhere along the line new user accounts after \"X\" date are not syncing. It shows the following in edge://sync-internals/ \n DISABLED_BY_ADMIN, STOP_SYNC_FOR_DISABLED_ACCOUNT, Microsoft Information Protection service is disabled\" \n So after a bunch of trial and error, the only option I had was to do the P2 License Trial just to see what happened and enable ESR. And of course that works, the new users are now able to sync.\n So my questions are, \n 1: Has anyone seen or run into this before? I am seeing conflicting info about how we should not have been able to sync at all without a P1/P2 license to begin with, and other places say no that basic sync was enabled a year or two ago.\n 2: Since I have the trial P2 license, I have not assigned any licenses to any users, just enabled ESR.

How do I go about not fucking this up?\n Edit #2: this is some of what I did previously...\n SSL cert updates\n Set up scheduled task with PowerShell scripts,\n IIS configuration\n Configured SCCM update roll outs\n Configuration management\n managing production servers\n Set-up Azure VDI\n Group policy management\n ​\n Edit #3: the new position seems to be heavy on cloud platforms, some scripting, and project work, my last job was project heavy so nothing new there.

          "description": "Sorry if this question isn't super high level, but it's a bit more complex than r/iphone would be able to help with. \n At my job we had a bunch of iPhone users lose a good portion of their contacts. We have corporate Gmail and originally their email/calendar/contacts were set up in iOS Mail using Activesync. Everyone assumed that this information was a 2-way sync, i.e. for example a contact entered manually on the phone would automatically sync up to the cloud, and any change they made in the cloud contacts would sync down to the phone. Seems like this was not the case though and manually-entered contacts were only getting stored locally on the phone, yet they were still attached to the contact list associated to the Activesync account.\n Recently the Messaging Team decided to phase this out and have everyone use the Gmail app instead. Problem is someone accidentally cut off the Activesync access before End User Support had a chance to migrate their data. Users started getting a persistent prompt to update their password, but this didn't work because the account was gone from the system essentially. People got fed up and just deleted the account, this process does not offer any option to keep stored contacts, you have the ability to either Erase or Cancel.\n Now in the texts and other apps there are phone numbers with no name attached. In some cases it's hundreds/thousands of contacts. Is there any recourse to get these back?\n    submitted by    /u/greggerypeccary  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you are one of those \"QB doesn't work on a VM\" people, please do not respond to this thread. It normally works fine, I have many customers on this scenario, including other DC/RDS combo VMs and the only issue is the conflict with the DNS server service. \n Anyone familiar with this topic knows there are two fixes to the service conflict:\n 1 - netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange commands\n 2 - script having the QuickBooksDB## service start BEFORE the DNS Server service\n ​\n OK, so hopefully we're on the same page here. Now to the NEW issue.\n For this customer, an earlier version of QuickBooks was working fine with the script-service-start-order workaround, for years. Then we upgrade to QuickBooks 2023. I know the number in the service name changed, I accounted for that. \n The new issue with QB2023 is not that the QuickBooksDB33 service doesn't start - it does. The issue is severe slowness in the QuickBooks program when the DNS Server service is running. Stop that service, QuickBooks runs well again. I have tried the excludedportrange commands (yes for the dynamic port listed in Database Service Manager) and port 8019, both TCP and UDP. I have tried the \"starting services in the proper order\" workaround, this does not work either. \n I've researched and beat up on this issue for hours. Asking other Redditors is my last attempt before telling the customer they need two hosted servers so I can move the AD roles and DNS off of the RDS.

Is it good enough to give static IPs to some devices on my DHCP server and leave the rest dynamically allocated or is it recommended to also use subnets e.g. with subnet mask 255.255.254.0 to then potentially have 4 subnets\n 192.168.0.0/26 192.168.0.128/26 192.168.1.0/26 192.168.1.128/26\n so I can give devices in different subnets? What would be the advantages of that? Is this more secure and faster? Or am I thinking wrong and I do need VLANs to have those advantages? I know I can use both in that they do not exclude each other because they act on different layers. But other then that I am a little confused.\n I am very helpful for any links and resources to learn more about this topic or any hints what is best to do. I am not fully understanding the implications here yet I guess.\n Many thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Stranger-Stick  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm hoping this is a super easy question...\n We're currently in the process of moving away from Sophos to Microsoft 365 Defender for all of our fleet, and my question is whether I am able to combine onboarding methods without running into any issues? \n Current thinking is to continue onboarding via SCCM and Intune, but then I'm hopng to also deploy a GPO to catch any machines that aren't communicating back, or for those servers and other edge cases that have been kept off management systems intentionally. In these instances, the GPO would likely hit machines that have already been onboarded via one of the methods above. Has anybody run into any issues doing it that way?\n Side question... for the \"local script\" onboarding method, Microsoft states that it has been optimised for ten machines only, due to some settings that expidite telemetry data from the machines, so suitable for pilot groups only. Is there a version of this that I can run that would just onboard them with the standard settings in the other packages? My google skills appear to be lacking...\n Thanks all!

It is sporadic and doesn't happen on any particular websites. It can be one website sometimes, then it works fine 5 minutes after, and then five minutes after the website working before, times out now. One thing that seems consistent is when a website times out, it seems to be able to load afterwards.\n ​\n There is no real other network impact, internal seems to be fine, servers seem to be running fine internally. \n Pinging is no issue, NSlookup is no issue.\n I've noticed that when trying to load a website, it may be very slow but connecting anyway. In Devtools it will have a stalled time on 15+ seconds and the rest seems perfectly fine.\n We have a setup of 4 MS250, 2 MS425, 2 MX84. Everything is completely firmware updated and have tried restarts just to make sure. \n We've had 2 different network consultants come and have a look at it, with no luck. I've written to our ISP but the issue seems to be non existent when connecting directly to our Edge router, so they're positive the issue is at our end, and the consultants are positive the issue is at the ISP end. \n We are at a loss, and this is why I turn to reddit in my final hour of sanity.

I've been tasked with data migration in SharePoint online sites, initially the \"guru\" admin said automation is not possible and we've all concluded that I can do this in 3-4 months, and during a couple of weeks, I was able to create a small script that can almost automate the entire process. With this script, I could move thousands of sites in just a few days, possibly even over a weekend.\n Here's my problem: I'm not sure if I should tell my boss about this script or not. On one hand, it could save the company a lot of time and resources, and I believe it's something they should know. On the other hand, I don't want to risk getting only a pat on the back for all my hard work.\n So my question is, should I tell my boss about my script? And if I do, how do I approach the conversation and ask for some sort of bonus or remuneration for my efforts?\n Some important context that I've missed out:\n  \nI work for a subsidiary company, they pay me and my salary is almost x3 time bigger than it was a year ago\n Theres an ongoing discussion of invoicing my time for the parent company since I've already helped them a lot and they realised that they need me.

Granted he's pretty good at tricking out his desktop theme but his 'ideas' are usually VERY bad. In this weeks drama, I have setup our DNS servers with load balancing and a 5 second health check. Boss wants to set our TTL to 6 seconds with the argument people using the site wouldn't notice the 5 second outage before the LB updates and we can be more nimble with DNS changes.\n Next up is a project manager that wants the TTL set to 12 hours so we can fix any DNS issues before anybody notices.\n I have spent 3 hours in a meeting with both of them trying explain why we want longer ttl than 6 seconds, but less than 12 hours. Once I address the ttl that's too short, the other says \"great, set it at 12 hours\". Then while I'm explaining why we want it less than 12 hours, the other says \"great, 6 seconds\",\n It's currently at 10 min because the PM's project makes alot of changes to their site and want the changes to take immediate effect for all of the public, but doesn't understand that the 12 hour TTL is completely opposite of that.\n The EE doesn't understand the additional latency of clients having fresh dns queries every 6 seconds. \n They are wearing me down and one of the stupid ideas is going to win.\n    submitted by    /u/jack-dempsy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Windows Firewall configuration is identical, the servers are even part of the same domain, have the same GPOs applied etc.\n We have three questions and would appreciate any feedback on either one:\n  \nIs there something we can do to make BatchPatch continue to work? We thought it was the vendor's responsibility to make sure that their tools continue to work post DCOM hardening. And it does work, in one of the subnets as per BatchPatch documentation.\n If there is something we can do, should we avoid that due to security concerns? \n Are there any other tools for Patch Management you recommend that work 100% post DCOM hardening? Preferably in-house/on-prem tools due to legal constraints. Must be able to schedule when the Servers reboot, automatic reboots are out of the question. The tool should preferably be agent-less but if agents are the only way (or a much better way) we'll go with anything that works. \n  \nThanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/dassruller  \n [link]   [comments]",

So we get X amount of GBs per month. If we use them up we need to purchase more (that's expensive af!). I have a Fortigate 100E which does all the content filtering. Students access the Internet and internal resources through a Aruba 505 cluster.\n We have enough data quota but these kids are using different kinds of VPN software to circumvent firewall restrictions. Before you ask, I have blocked all these in multiple levels (application filter, Web filter, and DNS filter). The only opened ports for them are 443, 80, and few other ports for internal systems. This setup blocks all well-known VPNs and proxy tools. But these teenage buggers always find some crappy VPN app or a proxy site that is conveniently not included in Fortigate blacklists. I usually monitor the usage patterns and identify these. Then I block them manually. It has been a game of whack-a-mole for a long time and I am getting tired. How do ya'll block these kinds of things? Is there any one-off way to do this? (policies are already in place but it's really hard to make teenagers comply with them.

Database is closed for internet, only available localy and web applications only 80 port. I have a openvpn server on smallest vps just to have an access to servers 22 by ssh and marketing guy could have an access to database directly (Before you will scream - the guy knows what is he doing and his user have only read access on sales table). So yesterday he visited competitors website to check their prices (literally clicked 1 link and left) and they sent abuse email that someone from our network IP visited their website ONCE and he wasnt on site for 30+ secs so search engine thought it was a bad visit and could derank their website. It's not a problem for this case, but they sending abuses on weekly basis like we have pirated scripts (that I wrote myself, just some JS popups), non licensed windows (but our servers are linux based), etc.\n We cant go against them in legal field since their legal entity placed in different country and just not worth it. \n What can we do or there any option to report it somewhere that they are sending abuse mails with no reason?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Zhuzha24  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I just inherited two Apache Tomcat Installations (prod and test) running on Windows Server. Since installation was done in a couple of years they received since then zero updates and running diffrent versions (9.0.31 on test and 9.0.27 on prod). Before adjusting the tomcat config itself (Disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1, disable weak ciphers etc.) I would like to allign the Tomcat Versions and update them to version 9.0.73. \n I found a couple of different ways how to do this minor update and would like to receive your feedback.\n First Approach Idea: \n  \nBackup current configuration\n Remove the complete tomcat installation\n Install the new version from scratch\n Adjust configs like server.xml, web.xml etc.\n Copy from backup the relevant webapps / certificates etc.\n  \nSecond Approach idea:\n  \nBackup current configuration\n Replace only the files inside the folders /bin and /lib folders\n Don't touch the rest of the config .xml Files\n  \nI found various diffrent approaches online from diffrent vendors and now i am litle bit uncertain how the \"correct\" approach would look like.\n    submitted by    /u/ProxyOps  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m asking because I’ve noticed a recurring issue with all US-based ISPs periodically losing all DNS information for an entire TLD, and all domains on that TLD (including mine) appear to vanish and go offline. \n Ping, nsloookup, and dig can’t resolve the domain to an IP. The entire TLD is gone, while all other domains remain online. \n Multiple third-party products, tools, and services confirm that the entire TLD ceases to exist for several hours at a time, which is very puzzling. Many alerts and notifications from our vendors arrive when this happens. \n I’ve reached out to ICANN for some information, but they are apparently not an authority for this TLD (it’s one of the newer ones that’s country-specific). \n The registry for the domain says there’s no issue, but they aren’t testing through any US-based ISPs. My offshore team can still access our infrastructure, while myself and all our US-based customers cannot. \n The registry’s website is also offline to all US-based traffic when this happens, since it uses the same TLD (*.et). Sites like downforeveryoneorjustme.com show their site as down when this happens. \n Very strange. Not sure where to look for answers. Thanks!\n Update: I’m realizing that troubleshooting this issue will require more experienced folks in networking. Terms like Bogon Routes, Looking Glass, ASN, IANA, and others mentioned here are new to me. If you’re particularly experienced in this space and are available for some consulting, or on-call emergency troubleshooting next time it happens, please send me a DM. I’d like to assemble a small group that can help get to the bottom of this US-only ISP / TLD issue.

We have 65 VMs (VMware environment) spread across multiple locations, Cisco switches, Fortigate firewalls and APs, UPSs, EMC SANs, Dell servers, Veeam Backup, Wasabi, SharePoint, OneDrive, O365 Mail (hybrid), Power BI, and 100 iPads (with a subpar MDM). The list could go on and on, and my point here is that we have only one IT director, one system administrator/network administrator/security person (me), and three helpdesk folks. One of the helpdesk people is amazing, but the other two just float by.\n My question is this: I've been here for 8 years, and I've noticed that we get zero training, everything is a dumpster fire that needs to be put out, management doesn't listen to important security changes that need to be made, and there are no policies in place, such as an email policy, internet policy, BYOD policy, etc. (I have sent all of these to management and HR for approval, but they just don't write back.) The culture here, as in the people, is great; I've never worked with such an array of awesome people. However, they don't seem to care about any structure or advancement of learning of any kind. I just constantly feel behind the eight ball and can never get caught up to even have time for training. \n Has anyone else's workplace been like this?

They offer 6.000€ more per year than my current wage working usually on remote but required to work occasionally to a warehouse that is an hour away in by train and another 15 min walking from the station, and doesn't seem to be a comfortable place to work in, besides they haven't confirmed if would be working on shifts and weekends which would be the worst. \n I'm not sure how to explain that the position would mean a worse quality of life for me and reject it but without losing face with the corporation which i would like be to work with in the future, or just ghosting them and saving the effort. \n Thank you for reading, and excuse me for any grammar mistakes.\n    submitted by    /u/Linker271  \n [link]   [comments]",

All of our printers have been in place for almost 10 years, I am taking this opportunity to hopefully standardize and improve the naming convention. If I can get examples of current names and why they are named that way I would greatly appreciate it.\n Edit 1: to provide an example of what we are doing, the printer refresh walkthrough revealed 324 printers, we have managed to reduce that down to 300. There are departments that have a single location like one suite and is somewhat simple, there are others that have multiple locations throughout the city. We currently have the implementation of the Follow-me printer and have many staff that use it as was suggested in the comments. One example I can provide is the Police Department and the many building they occupy and the multiple units within their headquarters, for instance I’ll make a couple up just for example: PD-224MFP01 or FIN-MFP02, for the first example Police Department/building/Multi-Function Printer/1st out of 2 printers.

I can't say if MRP speeds are faster as we have only had the MRP system recently so it was just being implemented when the lines switched, , but the CAD stuff would work almost as quickly as if onsite\n ​\n Now, what takes milliseconds onsite is taking 20 or so seconds (this is just opening windows, no manipulation of the MRP/CAD files). Speaking to our MSP, they have said that it's due to the XG overhead on processing and routing the data. But I genuinely struggle to see it slowing speed down so much. Especially as the CAD stuff worked file over L2TP \n If correctly configured, should we be seeing such delays over VPN? Onsite, everything is fine.

          "description": "I want to hear your opinions and best practices how to securely send out new usernames and initial passwords to about 1000 external users. \n My first guess was to make the announcement of the account migration, tell them the new format to figure out the username themselves (it's just firstname.lastname@domain) and send each an email with just the password without further context, so the information from one email is not enough. If I could encrypt the emails, it would be perfect, but I don't have the users public keys, as they are external. Though I have limited knowledge about email security, so please educate me. \n Is there another way to get the passwords to the users securely or is it \"good enough\" to just send them separately? (Passwords need to be changed upon first login.)\n Thank you! \n Disclaimer: I'm not the one responsible for the user migration, I just administrate the first service that wants to use the new AD.\n    submitted by    /u/Aveludic  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far I've managed most of what I need to do without much issue, but I'm running into some confusion when it comes to the Custom Logon and embedded boot features on enterprise. To a degree this is a (multi-app) kiosk deployment, we don't want it especially obvious that it's running windows, so we want to suppress all the boot UI and windows logon UI with autologin to a locked down account, we have an application we want to use for the shell in place of explorer and lock down any breakout keys.\n I've made a few custom images and managed to sort out all the users and automated oobe features I need, now I'm moving onto the lockdown/embedded features portion. Pouring through the documentation on all the customlogon and embedded features from Microsoft, I'm not getting much of a direct answer as to when and how to deploy them, has anyone here worked with them before?\n Will these deploy properly if they're apart of an answer.xml configured in WSIM and installed from a custom image? Do they need to be configured in WinPE and built into the image from there? Can they be implemented to the OS from a provisioning package after initial deployment?\n Any help is greatly appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/Miserable-Entrance-8  \n [link]   [comments]",

My problem comes in when they said they'll be outsourcing their work from other countries by offering their pc as a service to them. They want to restrict them from copying data / files from their pc and would only allow them to use the graphic design software. I'm overwhelmed and i am not sure where to start.

They recently moved to another office and finally made the choice to put some money into new server hardware, so we migrated their Srv2016 DC from an old ESXi to a new one. We didn't do a V2V (for various reasons) but chose to simply make a final Veeam backup and restored it as a new VM on the new host.\n At first boot the machine went into safemode (with AD repair) as we've expected. So we logged on, changed boot behaviour back to normal and rebooted several times to check if it's running correctly.\n Now, ~2 weeks later, users complained they didn't have access to a share anymore.\n So we've tried to login on the DC using our Domain Admin user and realised it isn't working. Screen says \"user can't login due to account restrictions or maybe wrong characters in password - as a blank\". That's nonsense. So we tried to login using the local admin account and there it says the account would have been deactivated (which isn't true either).\n Now we're stuck except for having remote powershell access (as system user) with our RMM software.\n I already used it for checking if some safemode has been activated (bcdedit) - which isn't the case.\n We also restarted the machine twice yesterday evening. Startup takes ages, but eventually it comes up to the same state.\n Anyone any idea?\n Cheers\n Jay\n    submitted by    /u/jay-from-the-bay  \n [link]   [comments]",

It disappears too quickly for them to get a screenshot. They said it says \"Error Printing\", followed by the file name and I think it is popping up from the print task tray icon. There is nothing in the event viewer for these that I can find.\n ​\n None of our Windows 10 boxes are experiencing this issue but all of the Windows 11 machines have at least once. Our printers are on a 2016 print server. We've reconfigured a couple to go directly to the printer instead but that didn't seem to help any. I believe it is happening on all of our printers, but the Ricoh is the only one I have log proof of.\n ​\n Googling \"Error Printing Windows 11\" isn't really giving me anything useful as you could imagine.

My successful rule looks like this in the M365 Exchange Admin:\n Apply this rule if Is received from 'Outside the organization' and has an attachment file name that matches these text patterns: '\\.htm\\.$' or '\\.html\\.$' or '\\.inetloc\\.$' or '\\.htm$' or '\\.html$' or '\\.inetloc$' \n But now I'm seeing another edge case where attachments with encoded filenames are also bypassing the rule. I determined that the encoding for .htm and .html are \"odG1s?=\" and \"odG0=?=\", so I added them to the rule, but they are still getting through:\n Apply this rule if Is received from 'Outside the organization' and has an attachment file name that matches these text patterns: '\\.htm\\.$' or '\\.html\\.$' or '\\.inetloc\\.$' or '\\.htm$' or '\\.html$' or '\\.inetloc$' or 'odG1s?=$' or 'odG0=?=$' \n The email source looks like this:\n ----==_mimepart_63f7bea11ed79_334ad8611585 Content-Type: application/html Content-Transfer-Encoding: UTF-8 Content-Disposition: attachment; Filename=\"=?UTF-8?B?NjUzNC5odG0=?=\" <script language=\"javascript\"> document.write(unescape('<redacted>'));</script> ----==_mimepart_63f7bea11ed79_334ad8611585-- \n Any ideas on how to get the existing rule to recognize these types of attachments?

I installed the latest update, for Icen version 1.11.3.0, irdman 1.4.3.0 and for Huawei Dorado 6.1.5. I made the configurations based on the Huawei guide. ROCE interface are connected directly to the server. The ports have VLAN 55 for controller A and VLAN 56 for controller B. I created logical ports to which I assigned physical ports. On vSphere I created virtual switches for each VLAN, next created storage adapters with NVME over RDMA. The problem occurs when I try to connect the controller.

But documentation indicates that shared mailboxes are limited to 50gb. Historically, when we would offboard a user who's mailbox is bigger than 50GB, we would add in an Exchange E2 license to allow access to the mailbox.\n If we DID have an archive policy in place, presumably after we converted the users mailbox to a shared - the archived mailbox would disappear at some point?\n These discussions happening as we determine the best path our our existing LARGE mailboxes (who are licensed with E3) - that we want to get licensed for Business Premium. Initial thought is toss on a Business Premium AND an E2 as a top up to 100GB - BUT the Business Premium licensing DOES allow for very large archiving...

Specifically, for an interactive art installation. What I am going to present is a \"trojan\" (not malicious) written in .VBS that takes control of the system and displays visual content as if it were a movie. The thing is that since I want to maintain the interactivity, being a public space, I need to isolate somehow the system and restrict unwanted activity (avoiding having to go to repair it continuously).\n I had thought about Microsoft's Kiosk mode, but I have Windows Home and I can't use it. With this, I thought of virtualizing a machine, but if the software crashes I don't know how I could automate the execution. Finally, I thought of using an isolated user and through UAC limit its range of action, but I don't know.\n What do you think?

Some layoffs have been 30 days, some have been 60 days, some have been two weeks. But while you're \"counting down,\" you can take all the paid time off you want to look for a job. Some managers let you go home with your laptop and just WFH till your last day.\n Now, as generous as this sounds, they do this for a singular reason. If you find another job during your countdown, you're not eligible for the severance package.\n Well, we had one guy that had been there FOREVER and got laid off. He was eligible for well over 6 months' salary in severance. Out of respect for his long history with the company, his manager let him WFH during his whole 30 day countdown...\n 28 days into his countdown, someone from my company goes to another company to have lunch with a friend. And he sees his old coworker working there at a desk, with our company laptop with the asset tag clearly visible on the open lid. When the guy walks away from his desk, sure enough, it's our laptop. The guy is VPNed in, and logged into Outlook and MS Lync (This should tell you how long ago this happened).\n The guy comes back from lunch and tells his coworkers about how the guy they lost on the team landed at a new company where this guy they know works. Sadly, the manager overheard them talking. He called HR. And the guy lost his severance package.\n So damn close...\n    submitted by    /u/plazman30  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are never onsite, they move around reservations DHCP and change scopes due to lack of knowing the firewall, and generally cause the site a lot of issues. Which is great for me right, i make a ton of money off their mistakes. Sorry but that isn't my game. I like good business and administration, not causing a hedge fire and saying o well #xyz is just another client. Recently i did a large overhaul and installation of new networks, vlans, wifi, ect... Today i get a call they made more changes and now changed the firewall password essentially forcing everything through them which for me means extra hours billing to wait on a tech. Is it time to just let the clients turn into an inferno and go about my day or should i be grateful my income is probably going to double from them and just shut up and color?\n It just really freakin urks me how bad they are for such a large company taking care of a small hotel which is literally nothing to manage.

However, we want two stations in our office to be available for remote people to use when needed. In an ideal world, those two stations could be connected to any of the Mac Studios at any time. The Macs would live in our data closet, and the stations would be about 30 feet away near a fiber-connected switch (if that makes a difference).\n My first thought was a KVM, but I’ve heard that these are not the most reliable in terms of latency. Each station would have two monitors, mouse, keyboard, and headphones.\n Does anyone know if this is viable with hardware? My backup solution would be to use Jump desktop to remote into the stations via LAN, which I think would work just as well.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ReelBack96  \n [link]   [comments]",

When the process completed all staff were on E5 with ALL E5 features turned on including Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing.\n Evidently, Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing once enabled does the following:\n  \nSends an email to all staff with their personal Audio Conferencing pin information (most of my staff thought this was a phishing email).\n Updates all future and recurring Teams Calendar meeting entries with the new Dial-in features. This uses the Meeting Migration Service (MMS) - Link\n Sends a meeting invite update to all attendees for each updated meeting\n If the recipient has their OoO on, an auto response is of course sent back to the organiser\n  \nThe above has caused mass confusion for our staff and in some instances, users have 60+ meeting invites and auto response/OoO messages all at exactly the same time.\n It's on us for not looking into this more but evidently its caught other people out as well.

We are expected to review any tickets that come in and work on them if they are deemed by either the customer or us important enough to service outside of normal hours, permitting their company has a proper contract for after hours support or they get approval from someone willing to pay the premium. This on-call included driving out to customer locations if the issue is of a truly critical nature. \n The on-call rotation is a full week from 5PM Friday until the following Friday, and then 2 weeks no on-call for the other 2 on-call technicians, thus a 3-week cycle. The compensation for this on-call is 80 hours of vacation time that is awarded immediately on your start date with no rollover. \n IF they hire additional Tier 2+ technicians then the rotation would be divided among all applicable techs but it's already been six months and it doesn't seem like they will be getting more people. \n So yeah let me know what your on-call experiences are like and what you think of mine.

I have the GPOs setup and 90% of the machines check in and install fine. I have adjusted the GPO so the machines check in every 3 hours to try and force them to download while they are online at some point throughout the day. Previously was set to every 16 hours by the previous guy. \n I have noticed the GPO was setup to auto download and schedule the install. The schedule install day is everyday and install time set to 10am. \n Is there a way to get the updates auto install at any time in the day when they are available to the endpoints instead of the set 10am schedule. If a laptop comes online after 10am the updates won’t install until the following day assuming it’s online before that time. \n Is there also a command I can run to force a machine to check for updates? I have used pswindowsupdate before using PDQ inventory to run a remote powershell command to check and install updates to the endpoints but from my understanding that doesn’t log in the update history under the updates settings tab in Windows.

We have a few enterprise applications that can only be managed by the vendor. \n We have LPA enabled with policies in the FW, but it is cumbersome and time consuming. \n We've been looking at StrongDM, BeyondTrust, and I heard SecureLink out there too.

However, we do not want the user to navigate manually to the path \\\\server00\\folder\\file1.pdf as there maybe something within \\\\server00 that we do not want the user to have access to.\n I can *probably* do individual permissions per user and it will work however...it's over ~400 users and managing that will be a nightmare...\n Ideally, I'd like to turn off UNC path access but allow it through the ERP application access. I know you can turn off UNC access via GPO and I tested this already but then it breaks the access through the ERP application when the user is logged in as well.\n Thanks for any feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/ryujin350z  \n [link]   [comments]",

Preferably we would like to use the Windows firewall for this, because we have no control over home routers and blocking these connections from home workers using company laptops. We can however control the Windows firewall rules using powershell on all of our endpoints, but I cant seem to block outbound SMB connections at all. We want to deploy firewall rules using this example powershell:\n New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Block SMB connections to public IP subnets\" -Direction Outbound -Protocol TCP -RemotePort 139,445 -RemoteAddress \"0.0.0.0-9.255.255.255\",\"11.0.0.0-172.15.255.255\",\"172.32.0.0-192.167.255.255\",\"192.169.0.0-255.255.255.255\" -Action Block \n It adds the block rule on top of the list wwith outbound rules, but somehow SMB connections keep working, even if I add our local NAS device to the RemoteAddress list.\n  \nWindows firewall is enabled\n Rule is present in all profiles\n ChatGPT had no useful tips for me 🫣\n  \nAnyone know how to do this using Windows firewall?\n    submitted by    /u/cfvr  \n [link]   [comments]",

As part of our degree program we are required to complete an internship. I recently received a job offer as an Intern where I will be working directly under a Senior Sys admin. I am a little bit nervous as this is not only my first job in IT but also my first Job in a professional office environment. I really want to do a good job and be a valuable member of the team but I am a little bit unsure what skills/technologies I am expected to be competent in as the job description was quite vague. I feel comfortable with basic stuff like configuring VMs and basic network troubleshooting but I definitely still have a lot to learn. I was wondering if anyone here could give me some advice as to what I should become familiar with before I start in May? What tools/technology’s do sysadmins use daily that would make me stand out if I am familiar with? Any advice anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.

Running windows xp connected through USB to some exact measuring large machine and having license usb dongle plugged in the usb.\n A quote came back from the company that installed it and its like 15,000€ for upgrade. This is eastern europe so multiple it by 10.\n Waned to give it a try and move the machine to a VM, and Disk2vhd worked and I am playing with windows xp in a hyperv. \n But apparently hyperv sucks when it comes to passing through USB. So next try is virtual box or esxi or proxmox/qmeu/kvm,... which with me having vhdx should not be difficult to move to.\n So anyone got some experience with usb passthrough in to VMs that is most reliable? I am thinking that option is also to get some PCIE usb card and that could be passedthrough too, As it works nicely with esxi and HBA cards in IT mode.\n    submitted by    /u/PrimergyF  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I'm more geared towards using it for automation and DevOps kind of stuff, though I am also learning Django for a possible business idea, and I have an real interest in ML.\n Anyway, back to my original thought, my interest in networking has seriously waned over the last few years and was looking at cloud.

So, I am afraid I will have to reach out to each user and ask them to registration their auth method as Microsoft authenticator before turning off legacy auth and moving over to the new Azure authentication gui.\n Is there an easier way , to go about this migration?\n If I turn off phone registration as a option in legacy mfa portal in o365 , is there a possibility it would only be forward facing for new users, and people who still have SMS auth will still be able to sign in to m365 services ?\n Again, we want the only option as a registration method to be passwordless mfa with Microsoft authenticator .\n    submitted by    /u/esisenore  \n [link]   [comments]",

The company swapped the motherboard in all the Chromebooks with another. To get the motherboard to sync with the Chromebook, they entered Dev Mode and switched the serial number to match the original Chromebook.\n When we got them back, it prompted us to re-enroll them, so we did. Now, the Chromebooks all have the same issue. When using wireless, it does not auto connect like it is supposed to. You can manually enter the CBNet Wi-Fi and password and use the Chromebook, but once you power off an on again, it doesn't auto-connect (although you can still click on the network and connect because the SSID and password are saved.\n We called the company, and they said that it is not an issue they've had, and they bought their motherboards from different manufacturers for the 3100 and 3100 2 in 1. We have tried an OS recovery, but we can't powerwash because we had it disabled in the Admin Console (it still appears to be disabled). We also can't powerwash through the console. It shows the last activity on the Chromebooks as months ago. When connected to the network with an ethernet to USB adapter, you can login to the Chromebook and use it.\n We have tried manually connecting to other Wi-Fi's, and that works the same as with CBNet. The only difference is that when connecting to the CBNet network, there is an exclamation point to the bottom right of the Wi-Fi symbol.\n ​\n Any help would be appreciated!!\n    submitted by    /u/StudentTechMV  \n [link]   [comments]",

We were advised by Sage's business partner in my country to set up a cloud instance with 16 GB of RAM, 4CPUs and 120GB SSD storage which we did. However, we logged in four simultaneous users and it seemed to be a bit sluggish. Given that during normal business operations, we'll have more than 10 simultaneous users logged in, this didn't seem like a good fit. Now, the confusion is this, the business partner had asked for a lot of money to set the server up. They say that there is a way you set up the server so that it becomes faster, he even mentioned that he has a server with the same specs handling more than 18 simultaneous users logged and working seemlessly. The question is, what is this \"way\" they are talking about? From my understanding the steps of setting up a server are pretty standard, I mean, chose the package (In my case AWS Lightsail) and then launch it. Are there any tips and tricks I am missing? A new installation I believe doesn't come with heavy and buggy software that would slow down the server.

The switch itself is member of a stack, but with only two members (one commander and one standby) which means both switches are actually active, so I cannot simply unplug it or it might cause outages and it's especially dangerous with the storage for our VMs. \n My question is : what would be your approach to unplug that switch with minimal impact for the end user ? Is there a way from vCenter to pause the infrastructure easily, and resume, and will that be enough to safely unplug the switch ? \n I don't have much knowledge and I'm the sole IT for a medium size company, and I have no experience dealing with this. \n Pausing the infrastructure is acceptable for a short timespan but I want to make sure that I am doing everything that is needed to ensure that no Vm integrity is at risk.\n    submitted by    /u/Alzzary  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a desktop guy at a small org, doing everything from help desk to server work. Intune management, laptop, phone setup, on off boarding, printer management, paper refilling, swipe card setup, desk relocations, visitor queries, water cooler repairs, the whole shebang.\n I have real problems with getting busy and forgetting what I was doing and I'm wondering how to manage this.\n I had a user ask me to do something, and between walking from one end of the office back to my desk and sitting down, I'd forgotten what it was was sitting down to do and proceeded to instead do the other two things I got asked about on the way. Sometimes I'll read an email and go to action it then forget what I was doing halfway through, or answer a question and then forget about the email completely. \n It's this kind of forgetfulness that keeps getting me in trouble with the boss. How do you guys manage this when you run into it? I have rules on my inbox to flag emails as they come in now, as well as a task planner in teams, but I still keep running into these issues whenever I get busy.\n I've mentioned it to my boss before, but short of moving to paid overtime to clear my to do list I'm not sure what I can do. I'm one of the lowest salaried staff at my org from what I understand, but I can't move jobs because I otherwise like my job and can't do things like that in my life (if someone had a gun to my head and told me to move jobs or stand up for myself I'd just take the bullet)\n Anyway input on how to not forget things would be great.\n    submitted by    /u/8ftmetalhead  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the carelessness is deliberately filtering for victims already. \n I have seen some very high quality spear-phishing attempts recently, that don't have \"mistakes\" in them. They have email addresses that look very plausible - sometimes spoofed, sometimes belonging to the .co.uk for a .com or similar.\n Occasionally coming from a personal email that looks like it could be a legitimate member of staff. Etc. \n But elegantly crafted, personalised and a very plausible sort of request or warning. \n The only way to spot these is to be skeptical about all of them. Don't rely on lazy scammers to be obvious about it, because that makes you vulnerable to the ones that aren't.\n If you want an analogy, then lets go with foraging for mushrooms.

          "description": "Long story short, we have a very remote site with two DCs and a handful of workstations. Everything has been powered off and is now reaching the 180 day mark, so we expect it to be tombstoned when the equipment is all started back up.\n For logistical reasons there may not be a way to get personnel on site before the equipment needs to be powered back up, and it may be a PITA to resolve the AD issues remotely as the only means of access is via relatively slow satellite internet. It's doable but not fun at all. \n Is it possible to \"trick\" the domain into avoiding the tombstone at powerup? Say for example, going into each machine at initial powerup before the OS is loaded and setting the BIOS clock back close to the last time the domain was live, and then moving the clock forward after all the machines have synced up? The machines will not have an external NTP time source initially so we don't expect that they will magically fix their clocks until we do it manually.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/wysoft  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the same time, he also insists on running BIND DNS inside a FLAR container on Solaris, when he is the only one that knows Solaris - these boxes also haven't been patched in years and run insecure versions of BIND.\n What do you call these people?

The server was hosting six production VMs, and due to a single PSU failure and motherboard issue(My finding), it completely failed. The worst part was that the previous system administrator had not backed up the critical databases.\n As the new guy, I was tasked with recovering the databases, and I was totally freaked out. I tried to recover the databases, but the server was unable to POST the ESXi, which made things even more challenging. After some trial and error, I decided to unmount the server from the rack and take it to my desk. I disassembled the server, removed the RAM, cleaned it with a vacuum, and rested it for over 10 hours.\n To my surprise, the hypervisor loaded successfully, and I was able to dump the six database files from one VM. However, the server suddenly went down, and I was unable to shift the dumped files. I tried again, and after a few attempts, the server worked for two hours before crashing again.\n At this point, I knew I had to act fast. I backed up everything and restored the system the next day, which was a challenging task, but I managed to get it done.\n I'm curious to hear about your experiences with server failures and database recovery. What are some of the worst cases you've encountered? And how did you handle them? Let's share our stories and learn from each other.\n    submitted by    /u/prosaugat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all- We have an existing RDS cluster with 8 session hosts and FSLogix that works reasonably well for ~80 users. The customer is interested in a RDS load balancing option that will consider CPU/RAM utilization on the session hosts in determining which server to put a new connection on. The built-in load balancing that the RDS gateway does is basically only number of users, with no consideration around metrics. It looks like there are a few third party apps that do this. Does anyone have a recommendation around this, and most importantly - can it be added on top of an existing RDS deployment? We're not interested in rebuilding things if we can avoid it.

The system is setup with C: as the OS and D: as has the Hyper-V files.\n Typically, a rebuild for this array takes about 12 hours. Right now, it's estimating 12 days! The odd thing is, the entire system has slowed to a crawl. Any IO on C: or D: brings the system to a crawl. Programs lock up for a few minutes.\n Looking at the event logs, and I'm getting a bunch of the following events:\n  \nEvent 9, Hyper-V-StorageVSP - An I/O request for device 'C:\\Virtual Hard Disks\\XXXX.vhdx' took 10675 milliseconds to complete. Operation code = READ16, Data transfer length = 4096, Status = SRB_STATUS_SUCCESS. We are getting this error for both C and D drives.\n \nEvent 129, percsas2i - Reset to device, \\Device\\RaidPort0, was issued.\n \n We also use VeeamOne and are getting disk latency alarms for both drives.\n I am able to export the VMs across the network to a different system without any issues.\n At this point, I'm thinking maybe a raid controller or backplane issue. Any thoughts? I'm super tried so pardon my if my post didn't make sense.\n Notes: Yes, I know the R720 is ancient.

Their brains bar for stress is much higher and it's usually chalked up to that. \n I want to thank /u/sobrique for bringing this topic up and leading me down an enlightening path. \n I have recently seen on reddit posts after the above post that ADHD is very heavily linked to alcoholism and I with alcoholism. I don't drink during the day( or even think about drinking alcohol), and only at night a little too much and things have become unmanageable with relationships in my life. I have been seeking help with alcoholism for quite some time, I had a long hiatus from alcohol and fell back in recently after some stressful situations. I am hoping that this diagnosis, with a coupled medication(dopamine levels normalizing, and not partaking), can help me get off of alcohol and get the old me back. \n I have blathered on too long and need to go to bed now.

In the process of replacing it with a 7600 ES+ card (76-ES+XC-20G3C) I had both in the chassis and pretty much copy pasted the config for each interface in use and unplugged the cables and SFPs from the old card and plugged them into the new one.\n Apr 15 10:24:24 EST: %TRANSCEIVER-3-OPER_ENABLE_FAILURE: Detected for transceiver module in GigabitEthernet4/10, module disabled \n Some SFPs were disabled. A few SFPs, I only noticed after I took another look at them are actually DS-SFP-GE-T, not SFP-GE-T.\n I added service unsupported-transceiver and no errdisable detect cause gbic-invalid, but it made no difference.\n Is there no workaround for this? In the first place, what is DS-SFP-GE-T?? It doesn't show up in the Cisco transceiver compatibility tool, DS makes me think mds9000 maybe? But it worked without complaint in the older linecard while it won't work even with unsupported-transceiver in the ES+ one. \n Right now I have both still installed until I probably end up getting the right SFPs, wondering if this was to be expected, on switches the hidden commands pretty much let you use any standard SFP with a scary warning prompt but on this platform it didn't even show me the warning, though it didn't have any effect either.\n    submitted by    /u/kumowoon1025  \n [link]   [comments]",

Simply trying to share my experience so that it can hopefully help others.\n For background, I have 1 year (three 4 month co-ops) internship experience, and have been working at my full time role for 3.5 months.\n Before anyone says anything about the 'validity' of the role/company, my new company is a huge employer and big bank.\n I understand this is Reddit and you should take my post with a grain of salt. You might have huge skepticism over if this is a true post or not.\n Luck/timing plays a big role. Clearly I don't have 'senior' level experience, but I do interview well, do have some work experience, but most importantly, I have my CCNA and DevNet, along with some network automation projects I listed on my resume (and no, not just simple projects from school. These are my own individual projects). I believe these factors were a massive help in me landing the role (the role said CCNP would be a nice-to-have and that automation experience was a plus).\n Another myth I want to shatter is about applying to jobs 'out of your league'. Again, by all accounts I should not have landed the role as I am only 3.5 months into my full-time career. But clearly there weren't too many eligible candidates and my new employer is deciding to take a chance on me.\n So just apply to any and every job that catches your eye.

I was hoping someone smart here could help me with the puzzle I have.\n Preface: Long time ago a very experienced networking engineer told me to never run a single ping packet. This is because, even aside of packet drops, there could be some other problems (if I recall correctly, related to ARP resolution) that may fail connection on the first ping, but succeed on subsequent ones.\n Some facts (all of this is true with default parameters): * When in Windows I ping something it runs 4 pings. * When in Linux I ping something it pings continuously. * When in PowerShell I use Test-Connection it runs 4 pings. * When in PowerShell I use Test-NetConnection it runs one ping (validated with WireShark).\n Question: Can someone tell me if that networking engineer was right?\n Bonus question: If that networking engineer was right, does that mean that Test-NetConnection is a bad command?\n (Please don’t dig deep into command parameters, ports etc. - the question is about icmp)\n    submitted by    /u/LengthinessPure3558  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey Everyone,\n Sorry if this isn't quite the right sub for this post. I have a question about a setup I came across at a small business. I didn't set it up, but the current setup doesn't really make sense to me so I'd like some help understanding.\n The business has two DSL connections. The first one is their internet connection. \n The second one is just creating a secure connection to a remote server that they need to access. The remote server they are accessing is at 100.100.0.1. This DSL modem is expecting a client to connect on port LAN4 at a client IP of 100.50.50.254, with a default gateway of 100.50.50.1. If I connect my laptop to LAN4, assign a static IP of 100.50.50.254, and a default gateway of 100.50.50.1, I can ping 100.100.0.1 no problem. That all makes sense. \n They are using a Cisco RV042G as their primary Router/Firewall. This router has a WAN port and a WAN/DMZ port. Currently it is configured in WAN + DMZ mode. \n The WAN port is connected to their first DSL modem, the modem is in Bridge Mode, and the router is setup to login using PPPoe. All internet traffic is routed through this connection.\n In the settings for the DMZ port, it has the option to select a subnet or range. Subnet is selected, and an IP of 100.50.50.254 is inputted in there. There is then a static route setup for 100.100.0.1, to be routed out the DMZ Interface. \n My understanding is the DMZ port as configured is supposed to be used to give a direct internet connection to a specific device, keeping it seperate from your LAN, and bypassing all firewall rules. \n But how it is being used is more like a dual WAN setup, with no Failover or Load Balancing, but where all internet traffic is routed out one WAN port, and only specific traffic is routed out the second WAN port. \n Can anyone help clear up what is going on here, and what would be the preferred way of setting this up? Thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/cd36jvn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Our telecom team is moving off of our old on-prem VoIP and going to a cloud hosted solution. We tried to future proof ourselves years ago so we have ample campus bandwidth (small user count, 10G everywhere, DC and user traffic totally separated) so we never had a real reason to try and shoot ourselves in the foot with a bad QoS policy - but now with projects winding down we all collectively decided that now is a good time to take a look at it.\n I've been going through Cisco Live's breakout sessions and am starting to get a grasp, but the whole \"cloud hosted VoIP\" piece is throwing a wrench in my machine. Below are the guidelines that I'm trying to follow:\n  \nMarking DSCP as close to the source as possible - We're moving off of Cisco phones, so part of my testing is to use \"auto qos voice trust\" and see if the DSCP values stick with non-Cisco phones at the access port level, not just uplinks.\n QoS policies in hardware, not software\n Specifically call out VoIP as EF/AF46/COS5\n  \nWhere I'm really lost is the cloud bit. As far as I know, ISPs don't give a toss about your DSCP markings and we aren't peering directly with this cloud service, so while the QoS that we haven't needed before would (well, might if we dont mess it up) work internally, all this work is going to be for nothing if we ship VoIP packets out into the wild internet and they get trampled.\n Is this just part of the known risk when going to a cloud service? I've asked for some technical documentation from them and we will have meeting where I can pepper them with questions, I'm just trying to get my ducks in a row and not be an IT dinosaur. \n VoIP in the cloud, exciting times.\n Quick edit, I'm heavily leaning on this Cisco Live BRKCRS-2501 session and have a QoS book queued up in O'Reilly Books that I'll chew on over the next month\n    submitted by    /u/CleverSocialExperime  \n [link]   [comments]",

At best with no congestion from neighbors sharing the OLT port, an XGS-PON user should only be able to get about 8.5 Gbps in either direction due to FEC and other overhead. I can't find anything anywhere talking about Ziply starting to deploy any flavor of 25G PON or active Ethernet, so what gives? Is this just another example of a company's Marketing department having no idea what they're talking about? I'd love to hear from any Ziply engineers if you guys are lurking here, particularly about which PON platform you've deployed.\n EDIT: Mystery solved. Ziply is in fact doing active Ethernet for their 10G tier (this is the transceiver they use). Kudos to them!

Normally, we use PLC splitters, but a manufacturer proposed an FBT splitter so we can daisy chain our taps (ie: 10% of light going to the tap splitter, with 90% of the light going to the next tap). These particular FBTs are described to work in the full 1250-1650nm range, which is unlike anything I've read, but great if it works.\n I'm worried about temperature. Everything I'm reading says FBT splitters work from -5 to 75 Celcius, where PLC's can go down to -40 Celcius operating range. The buildout is in New England, so temperatures can definitely get down to -20 celsius. Does anyone have experience with this?

Please bear with me as I am not an expert in networking.\n I have a Synology 802.11ac router with roughly 60 devices connected. Guest network is turned on.\n About a month ago, devices in the main network started to not have internet connection unless I assigned a static IP. I don't understand why but this has just been the case. Almost every device in the warehouse is now on a static IP. The guest network however is able to assign an IP naturally and the devices work without static IPs with no issue.\n That all being said, I have an alarm.com svr and cameras that I had to connect to the guest network to get them functioning at all which is not what I want. The svr is plugged in via ethernet (it has to be) which tries to connect it to the main network. I cannot assign an IP to the svr in the app which leaves me with a dead camera system since it cant connect to the internet.\n I'm kind of just stuck and would like to figure out how I can get the main network DHCP server to assign good IPs again and get my camera system working.\n Thank you in advance to anyone who can help me solve this!!!\n    submitted by    /u/AlternativeTiger7649  \n [link]   [comments]",

He insist when he sets his laptop to a static IP, it works fine, but when on DHCP, no luck.

Got a problem here that I’m perplexed by and don’t really know where to start… at least before saying “the connection your using is garbage.”\n So last week we changed the domain we were using as a vpn endpoint… was a red tape thing after being acquired… We were told to add “vpn.domain.com” to our existing domain… Anyways the change went well… or so we thought.\n About 12 hours after the change about 90% of people could connect… Of the 10% that couldn’t we realized they ALL had Spectrum at home. No one had issues with Comcast or ATT.\n Now, we have two guys on a business trip to do some maintenance on our servers at an out of state colo. They too are also unable to connect and are receiving the same error message “Cant connect to the specified secure gateway.”\n My manager says its because we don’t have ‘DMARC’ set up for this new domain… Everything I’ve read on DMARC seems highly specific to email so I’m very confused how this would be relevant…\n Without going down a rabbit hole – does anything jump out here that I should check?

If optical, what kind of optical (DWDM? Something else?) and how was that optical fiber provided to your company? If copper, did it use RJ45 connectors? Something else?

It's connected to our network, so all of us on the staff wifi connection are able to print to it. The printer is a Toshiba eStudio3015ac, if that helps.\n ​\n The problem we're encountering is randomly, sometimes a couple times a day, sometimes weeks apart, we'll get a random print job come through that none of us sent. It'll be 100+ pages with random letters/numbers/symbols on the first page, tons of blank pages, then a random symbol/letter/number on a page.\n ​\n Our network security company wants us to call them when a print happens so they can check the packet (I'm thinking is what they said? I'm a tech guy but networking-wise I'm clueless) and see where it's coming from. Our copy company is stumped as to what's causing it--they thought it was a faulty print driver, but we've replaced them on all staff laptops and it's still causing issues.\n ​\n We've downloaded Wireshark to try and monitor the traffic, but I'm having no luck figuring out how, exactly, to monitor incoming prints on the network printer.

Unfortunately trenching is not an option.\n I have a couple of NanoStation M2 however, the needs will include video streaming and spectator wifi. Goal is is to add a small switch in the press box and an outdoor AP in the stands. Afraid the NanoStations would not be sufficient.\n Was looking ideally at something that would work in the 60ghz with 5ghz failover and could give me approx gigabit duplex.\n Found MikroTik \"wireless wire\" for about $200 which is the first time I hear of them, but is there anything similar in price and management that can be done with Unify? The \"building to building bridge\" is $500 and seems to need some sort of management console (I think it can run in a VM so plausible).

To the best of my knowledge, we don't use the object store browser on the leaves themselves, we really only use the web interface on the APICs. I reached out to TAC and they recommended creating a new set of contracts and EPGs for in-band and out-of-band, applying a filter to block HTTPS to the contracts, and adding the leaves and spines to those new EPGs for in-band and out of band.\n I went ahead and built this and moved some leaves into the new EPGs, and the block works for out-of-band (e.g. I can nc -zv <leaf_OOB_address> 443 and get no response), but not in-band, and it's not clear why. Initially my thought was to set the filter to block 443 as a source port and add the contract as a provided contract, which seems to be what works for the OOB port. On the in-band EPG, I did the same thing, adding a filter for source port 443 > any and setting my new contract as a provided contract. That did not work, so I've since tried adding a filter for any > dest port 443, changing it to a consumed contract instead of provided, etc. I've opened up a TAC case, but they took a look at what I had configured and said it seemed right, so they're waiting on feedback from a higher level engineer to see if there's something additional needed.\n Does it sound like there's something I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/AlmavivaConte  \n [link]   [comments]",

The first 4 years I was your traditional networking engineer/admin working mainly on Datacentre and a little bit of Enterprise networks which I enjoyed but found the pace and travelling a bit stressful, although I think that was mainly due to the work culture i was in. I left that role in a hurry as the company took a turn for the worst and I got a Systems Engineering role focused on communications(networks). I've been here for nearly 5 years now and I find it quite mundane and none challenging and the pay is quite a bit lower compared to engineers working in I.T.\n I have considered going back into I.T but as ive been away from the CLI and \"traditional\" networking for a while I feel like I won't be able to. I guess you could say I've traded my hands on experience for more theory knowledge, understanding protocol standards, more physical layer including RF and the innerworkings of network devices and how they are integrated into a system of systems rather than end users. I know this is quite a unique situation but just wondering if any one has done something similar? Or has any opinions on me being able to get another job in I.T.

I'm just wondering if my methodology makes sense. Obviously there are better ways to do this but I was not given the lead time to setup monitoring and gather enough data.\n First I take the counter uptime in weeks and days and calculate the total number of seconds.\n TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS = (((UPTIME_WEEKS * 7) + UPTIME_DAYS) * 24) * 3600 \n My goal is to get a rough idea of the usage per second. But most of this traffic is during working hours and the uptime above is 24/7. So I divide by 5 since after nights, weekends and holidays I figure the vast majority of traffic is generated in just 20% of the time\n TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS = TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS / 5\n Then I calculate the number of bits from the number of bytes in the counters\n TOTAL_BITS = TOTAL_BYTES * 8\n Then I calculate the bits per second by dividing by the TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS\n AVG_bps = TOTAL_BITS / TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS\n Obviously this is a very rough average not taking bursts into account but I'm also taking some random 5 min average readings will pad the result.

We did a lot of mesh IP networks matching SAN network meshes, and it was amazing.\n I'm now in a position and we are considering using Edgecore/Wedge with CumulusLinux for a network rollout. I'm trying to figure out if its possible to do a PoD type network mesh design, but I'm coming up short as I search the internet. We haven't purchased these so we also have no support contact as of yet.\n What I have is a group of 8x racks with two switches per rack, and I'm debating what will be the best configuration to avoid or at least reduce having to do the classic multi-layer datacenter aggregation of switches to switches. We also won't be controlling the upper networks, it'll just be going directly into an ISP from within each group of 8 racks, and I want them cross-connected for faster local networking.\n If anybody knows if this is possible, thanks!\n I know I can create bridges between switches, that's fairly normal stuff. It's when you get loops even within a mesh that I'm less certain about.\n [edit]\n To clarify: What I have in mind is a classic star-mesh network from the SAN world, but in the IP world. I don't know if this is possible with this gear. It is possible with FastIron, but that might be the extent of it, and nobody else has done this sort of thing.

It has a pair of 16xge cards in it now. We are planning to add another card later this year thanks to some growth.\n I didn’t realize one of those cards was damaged early on and wrecked two of the backplane slots (:() forcefully trying to get the xge card with slightly bent rear pins in. Rookie mistake. It also has only re-s-2000s in it. It seems to be doing fine now with the four full tables it gets but I know I’m pushing my luck, it runs 32 bit junos (and from what I can read, only supports up to what it runs now at 15.1), and we probably will be adding significantly more routes over next few years.\n I’d like to get something that is newer but still used and has potential for another 4-6 years of JunOS support. I’m happy with the mx480 platform and am not angling to change. Especially since if I get a newer chassis I can reuse my existing power supplies and have a spare fan module. Is the mx480- bp3 chassis with scbe2/re-s-1800x4-32g new enough to achieve that goal? Latest JunOS for a while, full tables, relatively newish.\n So far as I can tell, even the current MX isn’t stressed out at all…. I really am just thinking about the next half decade more than the now. Rather make the change now than when more people will be impacted. https://postimg.cc/GBxyfqj2\n EDIT: the big cpu spikes were me switching routing engines so I could reboot them.

I'm aware in long-distance networks, propogation delay is based around the speed of light (1ms of latency per 125km, *when traveling over physical media). However, the figures I'm observing in real-life are higher than would be suggested by this.\n Example: The RTT between New York and San Francisco should theoretically be around 48ms. However, the actual figures observed are closer to 70ms.\n With this in mind, where is the attentional latency coming from, and is there a good \"rule of thumb\" multiplier that I can use to estimate latency? I'm aware that serialization & processing delay is a thing, but given today's interface speeds, I can't see how that could possibly add up to anything significant. Does the added latency come from the fiber optic medium itself? The fact that light is not traveling in a vacuum?

So far this works for a dedicated NOC tech to turn up or down or apply different traffic shapers to the interface but that generates a lot of tickets for work that I don't want them doing all day long but I can't necessarily teach the customer service or billing people to do those tasks. \n ​\n Now we do run UNMS/UISP because we use it for managing GPON ONUs via UOLT, ERX, Air Cubes and other Ubiquiti products but I keep seeing stuff about the UISP Switch Pro being able to apply Traffic Shaper profiles and turn up/down interfaces with ease. Before I order one for testing, is it just as easy with the new CRM system to create a customer, apply a service plan and assign a port interface just in a similar fashion as the GPON ONUs? If so, that would alleviate a lot of manual work!\n    submitted by    /u/tallnerd1985  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I’m in an odd situation here. I’ve spent the last 15 years of my life buried in the CLI to become the best network engineer I could. I got my BS degree (bullshit degree I call it), I got my CCNA r/S, CCNA Voice, CCNP r/S, and I’m working to renew it into an CCNP Enterprise…. But I’m burnt out. \n I work so much that it’s crumbled my personal/family life. I’ve also grown into an alcoholic over the years. I’ve worked the 12 step program but with the stress of my job – I keep going back to the boos. It’s time to make a change. \n So I’ve been putting out apps for jobs that I’m essentially overqualified for – main reason is so I can go to work and not have to stress. I can set up a VLAN instead of design a whole VXLAN from scratch. I can make sure the link lights are up – instead of delve into the CLI for 3 hours trying to troubleshoot things down to the packet level… At least – this is my plan. \n I have a final interview for a NOC 3 position. The pay is surprisingly good for a NOC job and based off what I learned in my second interview – this job should be a breeze. \n So my strange question is – has anyone taken a step BACK from the hard charge “study everyday” mentality? If so – did it help your personal life? What’s it like working in the NOC from the perspective of a more senior guy? I ask because most NOC techs I’ve worked with were early career (justifiably so). I’ve never worked in a NOC but everywhere I’ve worked has had one – so I’m familiar with most duties. \n I’m doing this to save my marriage, personal life, and get my shit back together – and I’m blessed in that the paycut is not all that bad since I’ll be a t3… No they haven’t given me an offer but I told them my bottom line number and they still called me back 1 hour later to do the final interview.\n    submitted by    /u/Avionticz  \n [link]   [comments]",

This differs per connection, on my normal home wifi I see above behaviour, when connecting to a 4G hotspot (either tethered or via wifi to a 4G router), there are no ICMP replies from 1395 onwards. And pings with DF-bit set never return the Code 4 reply, so that might be filtered in 4G networks.\n    submitted by    /u/aloft050  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are a small company with little focus on security, but I'm aiming to improve our situation.\n Best practices are certainly not being followed and I'm just now digging into how to get us to a good spot. I've recently enabled URL and Application monitoring for our lan to wan policy. App monitoring is requesting deep inspection, but it seems the impact of doing so must be considered.\n - Any advice for whether to enable deep inspection or not?\n - Should antivirus be enabled on our lan-to-wan policy with out-of-the-box defaults? What about DNS filter?\n - Can I setup alerts to fire when a \"monitored\" category URL is hit? Or can you only fire alerts on a blocked URL?\n What would be your recommendations if you had a \"new\" Fortigate firewall dropped in your lap? I'm willing to consider some of the subscriptions Fortinet offers, such as Forticloud/Fortianalyzer, if the value is there.\n The current goal is to increase visibility into user activity. We don't regularly monitor, but in the event we want to check on someone's activity, we want that ability. Right now I'm struggling to glean meaningful info from our App/URL monitoring and can't find a way to filter by categories (such as adult categories or suspicious/blocked URLs).\n I'm going to be taking this one step at a time, so any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n (Let me know if this is far too broad a topic for this subreddit)\n    submitted by    /u/infosecspec  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi /r/networking\n I'm working with a client that's exploring options for SASE and SDWAN for around 200 branch sites. They don't run redundant internet circuits at the majority of these sites, so I have steered them away from expensive SDWAN solutions to accompany their SASE purchase; I don't see any value in branch SDWAN appliances if they are single-circuit for the foreseeable future.\n My question is: has anyone out there found a relatively low cost, IPSec capable, cloud-managed router with some level of enterprise support available? A good low touch provisioning workflow would be a big bonus as well. These devices would strictly be used to feed traffic from branch sites into the selected SASE solution via IPSec tunnel. We would either do a static default on the branch routers, or distribute a default via an IGP. The SASE solution will double as their WAN in this case, for branch-to-branch connectivity.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/tilphecklenburg  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example, a Wiki or handbook or something that goes over all the different equipment you use with reference configs and topologies?

We are currently in the process of upgrading our systems and I have been tasked with finding a way to setup our IP cameras on a VLAN using a \"router behind a router\". The equipment I have to work with is an IP camera (HikVision), a Ruijie router, connected to the office router and a Ruijie switch. The setup we currently have goes:\n Office router -> Ruijie router -> Ruijie POE switch -> IP camera\n What we are trying to do is set the camera up so that the office router could be on a network for example 192.168.1.1\n and the camera could be setup on 192.168.2.1 but still connect to the internet as it requires internet to be viewed remotely. I have managed to set this up fairly easily however, we also want to possibly avoid any rogue connections being able to access the office network if they managed to break onto the \"cameras network\". I am not entirely sure if this is possible as obviously the camera needs to access the internet. Right now, when connected to the Vlan that the camera is on (192.168.55.1), I am still able to access everything on the office network (192.168.1.1). Is there a way to avoid this?\n We also are trying to see if there is a way to access the camera wirelessly through being connected to the office network, however, again, I feel this may not be possible as right now, I need to be connected directly to the Ruijie router through ethernet to access the camera.\n Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/CMS03_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mostly because I vaguely know enough to break shit. \n Anyway the problem is that over the last couple of days I've noticed internet performance on WiFi devices has gone to absolute crap. I have a 1200 Mbps internet connection and from wired devices I can get a speed test showing almost 1 gig down. Wifi devices connected to my Cisco APs is something like 180 Mbps on 5 Ghz and on 2.4 Ghz the speeds are like 60 Mbps down. I can tell something has gone on with the Cisco stuff because if I take the xfinity gateway out of bridge mode and use that WiFi I get download speeds similar to the wired download speeds. \n Hoping some folks can give me some things to look at and hopefully get my wireless back to normal.\n    submitted by    /u/400HPMustang  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My company is in the market for a copper cable qualifier. We need a way to quickly, easily, and reliably test our primarily Cat6 infrastructure for bandwidth, packet loss, and continuity. Additionally, we don't have anyone on staff that is an expert at networking, so having a tester that is easy to learn and use is almost a necessity, as we don't have the time or resources to learn complex networking concepts. For the most part, everything is Cat6, but the cable certifier needs to support potential future infrastructure upgrades such as Cat7/Cat8. Based on the research I've done, there are a few options, but I'm not sure which direction to go. I really like the look of the Fluke DSX2-8000, but I thought Fluke sold off their network testing line to NetAlly, so am I buying into a dead ecosystem? NetAlly doesn't seem to have an exact replacement for the DSX2-8000, but the EtherScope nXG looks promising. There's also the WireXpert 4500-PRO and NetXpert XG2 from Softing, but I'm worried those will be too complicated to learn and use effectively.

          "description": "Ok. So, I currently have 144 small mini computers (actually, 2021 Apple TV 4Ks) with a bespoke app in single-app mode that are used on film sets for displaying graphics on computer screens, with remote loading of content and a control protocol for color correction, etc.\n Works great.\n The issue I have is with the # that can be simultaneously powered on at a time and associate with an AP. I have found that Qualcomm's Networking Pro 1200 platform within a (wait for it..) Ubiquiti Amplifi Alien on channel 165 works great for my use-case. Channel 165 is the only channel I have available for use on a film set. All others are unavailable, especially DFS channels. These are never available, because of Teradek Bolt camera wireless video systems.\n On the Alien, I can easily power on 100 or so Apple TVs and they associate fine. But, beyond this number, I need to space them out by several minutes. If I wait a few minutes, I can easily get 144 client associations and everything works fine and dandy. But, the inability to power them all on simultaneously could be a problem. On some sets, this would be impractical, because the power for the entire set is turned off at wrap, and turned on at call time the next day. So, ideally, I'd be able to have 150-200 associations happen seamlessly and without delay.\n So, question is: what other vendors are using this Qualcomm Networking Pro 1200 chipset with 8x8:8 MU-MIMO on 802.11ax in an AP that perhaps has a quicker client association time?\n Had my eyes on a Ruckus R850, perhaps with a Netgear M4250 AV Line switch (model # GSM4210PD-100NAS) which has a built-in DHCP server, as we've had very good results with this series of switches generally.\n Thoughts?

After that it's often quicker, which then makes diagnoses more difficult.\n I previously setup the old one up and think I had similar issues, but that was not too far off a decade ago!\n I have tried to copy the default gateway (and other routes) in each case\n Old one\n ​ default 11.11.11.11 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth1 \n (I have replaced the correct IP address with 11.11.11.11)\n New one\n default gateway 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth1 \n (The new one just has the word gateway, I entered it with the ip address.)\n Any suggestions of what I should be doing to work it out, or obvious reasons for this behaviour?\n    submitted by    /u/geeered  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to set up 802.1x authentication (using a RADIUS/NPS server) with dynamic VLAN assignment.\n I noticed that there is a limitation of 16 VLANs, but I couldn't find anywhere if this limitation is static or dynamic. In other words, is it possible to have more than 16 VLANs via 802.1x?\n Since I'm going to have to trunk between my switch and the terminal, does the limit apply at the trunk level or at the AP level itself? Or does it have to do with the number of simultaneously active VLANs?\n Thank you very much for your help.

I have up to 2 physical interfaces on each Nexus 3k's that I can use for these Layer3 links. The ASA has plenty of physical interfaces to work with.\n I'm looking for the most resilient configuration possible, with the hardware that I have, to advertise the default route from the ASA and the SVI's from the core switches. I would prefer to stay away from static routes (other than the default route on the OUTSIDE interface) if I can. EIGRP or OSPF would be preferred.\n There seems to be heavy debate about using vPC's for layer 3 links. Some say its possible, depending on hardware/code version, some say that even if it IS possible, its poor design. Some people seem to recommend ECMP from the firewall.\n To the community: Would you please loan me your experience and provide some advice for my scenario, with some configuration examples?\n Thank you all SO very much for your contributions. \n Mike\n    submitted by    /u/mike75020000  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe one of you can help me.\n For a shake test of an RJ45 to fiber optic converter, it must be checked for correct functionality during the simulated earthquake.\n What do I have in mind: My idea would be the following structure... Laptop -> (RJ45 cable) -> Converter -> (FO loop TX to RX)\n https://ibb.co/vLvQz5R\n Now I think I know that the UDP protocol is one-way and I can use a python script with the socket library to send a UDP packet over the laptop's ethernet interface to itself over the loop with the converter. If the packet arrives at the open socket, the connection is OK.\n Unfortunately this doesn't work. I receive the sent packet at any time. The packet is probably still delivered internally in the computer and does not leave it via the Ethernet interface.

On Cisco, I would configure an IP SLA, but this doesn't seem to be an option on AT. Is there a way, or do I have to load balance?\n I've never used Allied Telesis before so this is new to me. I've done some googling but there doesn't seem to be a tremendous amount of resources out there for this brand.

          "description": "Hi All,\n I'm encountering a strange problem with TACACS+ that I've never seen before (or at least never noticed). When an incorrect password is entered on a client device I would expect a 'Password:' request message to be sent by the TACACS+ server, a reply from the client containing the password, and then a 'password incorrect' message back from the server. This does indeed happen, but then immeadiately afterward the client sends the password for a second time, despite me only having entered it once. This goes to happen a further two times before the server eventually sends a 'authentication failed' and it all stops. Resulting in a total of 4 messages being sent by the client containing the password (again at this point I have only entered it once). \n This wouldn't normally be a problem except we are authenticating TACACS against AD, which locks out users after 3 incorrect password attempts. Because the TACACS+ client sends the password a total of 4 times, the users is immidiately locked out of their AD account if they enter their password incorrectly just once.\n I'm seeing the same behavoir on both Nokia and Juniper (mx, srx, qfx) clients, and have now replicated it in a lab using a completely different TACACS+ server (TACGUI) and the junos olive image. I'm also very confident it is not the SSH client as it happens with putty, secureCRT, mobaXterm, and the buildin ssh client on a Linux box.\n I'm really stumped as to what is causing these clients to send the password a total or four times, even though it has already been rejected, and the user is not entering it again. Is this expected behavoir? Can I stop it? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\n Regards,\n Frustrated Network Engineer\n    submitted by    /u/jnewto31  \n [link]   [comments]",

With the new design, we are considering whether to change this. The datacenter core will be formed by a vPC Nexus pair. The consideration is then to transfer all SVIs ( with HRSP) to the Nexus pair. ospf should then announce the routes to the Nexthop router (firewall) and vice versa. In this way, the north-south traffic can be regulated and monitored via the firewall.\n The question now is: how can I handle the east-west traffic? InterVlan communication can then no longer be monitored and regulated. One possible solution would be to use VRFs on the Nexus switches. These are then routed to the firewall via a separate transfer network.\n At the moment, the throughput of the firewall is not a problem, but since we can connect servers with higher speed due to the new hardware, there could be an increase.\n What is the best way to implement this in the data centre in terms of security?

I'm attempting to place ACLs inbound and outbound on all my VLANs, but I keep running into an error that there aren't enough hardware resources. In talking to Ruckus support, it came to light that the hardware limits on outbound ACLs are much tighter than inbound ACLs. In the Ruckus world (not sure if this applies to other brands as well) inbound means traffic going into the switch from the VLAN and outbound means going into the VLAN from the switch which brings me to my question...\n Is it normal or best practice to have ACLs on each VLAN in both directions? It seemed like the most secure thing to do to me, but if switches are built with more resources available for inbound ACLs (from the VLAN to the switch), is it best practice to only use inbound ACLs?

Slowness observed while surfing the web on phone/laptop while connected to wifi.\n He is in a remote site which doesn't have too many users and is connected via layer 3 Verizon epl back to our main site.\n He says he roams around say about 30-40 ft from his desk and it is still slow. Tried rebooting the AP that he was connected to (which I was able to see from the controller) which didn't help.\n His ethernet connection (Ethernet cable connected directly to laptop) works fine so I'm guessing it has to do with the APs themselves.\n What other troubleshooting steps can I look into to diagnose the cause?\n Probably have to look into the gui of the wlc I'm guessing.\n Also we upgraded the wlc from 8.1 to 8.3 about 2 weeks back and he says the wifi has been working slow ever since then.\n Right now we have only 1 wlc functioning in standalone which used to be 2 wlcs in an active standby pair before the upgrade as we ran into some complications. Will attempt to upgrade the other wlc tomorrow with Cisco support and get them back to the active standby cluster setup as it was originally.

It created a loop, even tho configured as stated in their documentary and made everything to shit down. \n Connecting distribution layer was a mess to. It looped again due to a bug with STP. Since you have no real centralized management, we had to troubleshoot on Firewall GUI, CLI and Switch CLI. You can completely forget about the Fortimanager integration. \n Accsess layee integration got its own bugs. Since were running a split vendor environment right now, we had problems connecting the switches to the 1048Es 10gig lwl ports. Had to do some config adjustments on the old switches too. \n Configuring these switches is verry „interesting“ too as Im used to CLI only. The CLI itself is nothing compared to Ciscos or Junipers. Though I like there firewall configuration, the switch controller GUI seems to be buggy as well. Some menues doesnt show all options so you have to increase window size to actually view everything.

          "description": "I was informed that I could talk to the Cisco sales rep for quotes. I am planning to convert my current collapsed core into spine leaf architecture. My network is not that big. It is basically 1 production and the rest are tenant networks. The traffic is 95% east west and the remaining 5% is north south is when we are doing a test with other organization. We do a lot of BUM traffic and multicast. We have some instances that some tenants will run some test between them. We also do a lot of data transfer to our storage from 500GB to some TB. We have some compute nodes to process the data that got transferred.\n About a firewall, I am leaning towards Palo Alto. I have worked with PAN in the past and really liked it. \n Anyways, I am thinking two the Cisco Nexus 93180YC-FX for the spines and leaf switches. Is the 93180YC-FX good candidate for spine?\n I would like to use VRF-lite to each tenant/lab. We currently have 8 tenants and growing. At the moment, I am still wrapping my head around how I can get the two tenants to connect to each other via L3VNI. What is the typical way of doing this?\n About the firewall, I am still trying to figure out the best place to deploy it. Reading some Spine leaf docs, it seems the firewall is usually located at the border leaf. And the Upstream network is on a VRF-lite. Some says use the firewall to route between tenants. The global table seems to be just the fabric. Am I understanding this correctly?\n I would like to use my C9300 as an access switches and use VRRP between the local leaf switches. Is this even a valid design in the real world?\n Does the leaf need to be in vPC if I were to do VRRP?\n    submitted by    /u/forwardslashroot  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll preface this with I'm in the UK and getting stock of anything has been a nightmare since Brexit!\n New building is a training facility/office space with about ~300 data points across 2 floors. On average there's only about 70 users on site, but it peaks to ~350 with guests etc.\n I've been in talks with Aruba for a while, and they've finally given me their solution, which is 2x CX6300M and 6x CX6100 which is coming in at over £100K MSRP. Originally they spec'd CX6400 at almost £220K!\n Their issue is the lead time is 36 Weeks at best for the 6300, and 15 Weeks for the 6100.\n The second option is to go UniFi, I've already got an extensive UniFi wireless system already and we're sticking with Unifi for the wireless in the new building. I'll probably still stick with an Aruba 2930 at the core acting as the layer 3 router - I'm also looking at firewall options between Sonicwall and rolling my own PFSense on HPE server hardware for layer3 routing.\n The UniFi solution of 2x USW-Enterprise-48 and 6x USW-Pro-48-PoE is almost 1/5th the cost at less then £20K, obviously it lacks a lot of the features of the Aruba, and their Layer 3 stuff is laughably bad.But at 1/5th the cost, and being able to get it with only 1 weeks lead time, is this a good option or am I crazy?\n For the money I could by a cold spare of every Unifi switch and still be half the cost of the Aruba option.\n    submitted by    /u/thejonson  \n [link]   [comments]",

This will have engineers giving their opinions about a (fairly) new technology that they have actually implemented and their opinion.\n An example of a valid post will be:\n - We currently have Cisco DNA Center, and backing up this product is horrible (among everything else). You can select a backup destination, an NFS mount, but it does not have the option to \"keep x amount of backups\" or \"keep the last X backups\". Upon researching, I have found a bash script written by a Cisco engineer where you put it on the NFS server (its a bash script), deleting backups older than X amount of days. I realized that if backup was failing for a couple of weeks in a row and I was on holiday or forgot to check the backups on a daily basis, that script would delete all backups. It is such a bad design.\n ​\n Examples of bad posts are:\n - Vendor X has announced technology Y. This is a marketing/sales post where it was not a tested feature.\n - I have reused my old Cisco 2950s for OoB management.

We got great coverage and all was decent, but throughout time I am noticing that they aren’t that great. They will randomly lock up (still can ping but gui not working nor can anyone connect) so we have to reboot. Lately it seems like they like to disconnect frequently, especially for iPads. It’s so frustrating. Does anyone have any suggestions for a different AP for a mid sized business? I believe we have 20 AP here.

I basically need a client (192.168.1.1) to talk to another client (192.168.2.1). They can both talk to their servers (192.168.1.254 / 192.168.2.254) but I can't get the servers to talk to eachother.

And please either feel free to totally correct me or can you please verify if I'm right as well.\n For data plane flood and learn, it's multicast on the underlay, using a combination of OSPF (an IGP) to distribute the RP addresses everywhere, and multicast to send out the packets to the R…",

However, I don't have any certifications, and I was added to the senior engineering team at this company. It felt like ( and still sometimes does ) I'm underqualified for the position. I was told my hiring manager a big reason I was selected for the role was outstanding soft-skills but I feel like for my current role I'm lacking a bit in more technical areas. Most of my coworkers on my team are senior Network Engineers with 15-20+ years on me, and while I'm learning practically every minute, I feel like I want to pursue a certification of some sort to solidify my skills. I also want something to increase salary potential down the road. Right now, being part of the LAN team, I deal mostly with L2 & L3 switching and I enjoy it. I'm considering studying for the CNNA and eventually CCNP. I also work closely with a CCNP and his knowledge and experience troubleshooting at the packet level is something I'm aspiring too. Given all this, do you think my time and effort be better spent studying for something else?\n    submitted by    /u/littlj9  \n [link]   [comments]",

In a DR scenario, in my DR site I can bring up and advertise matching subnets/SVIs matching those from my production site - who theoretically just got blown up and is unreachable. I can bring up my VMs and infrastructure through replication. My MPLS provider speaks EIGRP with me so I can reannounce that 10.0.0.0/22 now lives in DR. This is all fine and tested.\n My issue is that in a test scenario where I want to bring up VMs and test them on their original subnets - I’m curious how you folks would handle this. Would you advertise with a lower metric and risk a split brain routing scenario (scary)? Would you suppress advertisements until you’re ready to be in a DR scenario (seems safer)?\n I can comfortably automate these types of changes via Cisco scripting/my choice of automation front end. I just want to be able to test these VMs from a sandbox in DR that you can get to via a jump box.\n Open to all ideas and possibilities!

Peer routing is enabled on both nodes.\n Both switches contains VLAN 40 and VLAN 50 with an ip address assigned. sw-core1 is the default gateway for the devices inside VLAN 40 and VLAN 50.\n These are the tests performed:\n When both switches are powered on devices on VLAN 40 can ping the devices on VLAN 50 as expected.\n When one switch are powered off (failure scenario) PC on VLAN 40 can ping the PC on VLAN 50 as expected.\n If during a failure scenarion of the primary node (sw-core1 powered down) I restart the backup node (sw-core2) after the boot I cannot ping any device indefinitely. Only powering on the sw-core1 restore the comunication.\n Is this a correct behavior or I'm missing something in the configuration?

Over the years, the topology was consolidated so that one of two core switches became the root bridge for every VLAN at the site. The appropriate number of MST instances for us to have today is two.\n We knock down and stand up subnets all the time, and every time we do, we have to pick an unused VLAN tag that is already mapped to one of the 21 MST instances—which is fine, but the instances have no bearing to what we actually do. When an engineer asks, \"Which instance should I pull this tag from?\" the answer is, \"Whichever you want.\" Consequently, things are so mixed up that we'd have to not only create a new MST region, but basically start over with our VLAN tag/subnet associations to get them into the correct one of the two new instances.\n I'm not clinically OCD, but I hate inefficiency and inconsistency. Hate. It. If this were a small business, I'd be willing to substantially inconvenience my life to clean this up during maintenance windows. But this is a site that has hundreds of VLANs, 600 users, a datacenter with 80 server racks, and a significant internet presence. When a city has poor road design, we all live with it because it's impossible to fix without knocking the city down. I'm thinking this might be one of those situations. I've never tried to fix an MST region before, but I know it can't be done without downtime. And literally the only people who even know about this inconvenience are the network team. Cleaning it up will not noticeably improve network function.\n Do you agree that we should just deal with it forever?

          "description": "Hey folks. I work for a small WISP, where we have a VPN to access our stuff out in the field. We have a VPN which for the most part works as expected, that is, until you try it on metro by T-Mobile. At&t and Verizon are fine, but TMobile is having some glitches\n First of all, my TMobile phone has VPN access over wifi, and even when it's roaming on at&t, the VPN works. I mean, I can barely do general web browsing when it roams to at&t, but accessing network resources actually works great. \n \"Well when you say it doesn't work, what do you actually mean by that?\"\n Well, I can turn it on and get an IP Address. I can go into visit whoismyisp.com and it will tell me the name of the ISP I work for (and not TMobile ), and web browsing is as good as without a VPN. I can ping the private addresses of stuff on our network. But when I try to log into the GUI of any equipment, it just times out. \n That seems odd to me that I don't know how that can even work, provided I can definitely get onto the VPN. \n I am quite confident that reaching out to TMobile will be fruitless in getting the VPN to work properly. Any ideas what I could try here?\n    submitted by    /u/IllestAndRealest  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My peers and I are designing a new network for a school district, let's say... Fake School District. We've hit a good point in our switching and would like to move on to our wireless. In my mind, I would like the SSID's setup like this:\n FSD - Main network; RADIUS for AD authentication FSD_Unsecured - No PSK; MAC ACL; exists only for devices that don't support 802.1X FSD_Setup - No PSK; Access only to the site for agreeing to terms & conditions and downloading the cert for the main network\n I have a few questions about the configuration I proposed here:\n 1. Can I use the same NPS I use for the main network for the MAC ACL on the unsecured network? 2. If I register a MAC for the unsecured wireless network, can I dynamically assign a VLAN similar to security groups with my main network? 3. Will I need a web server for the FSD_Setup network or will my WLC (UniFi) do the trick? \n Basically, I'd like these scenarios to be true:\n Scenario #1: A student brings their own device. They connect to FSD_Setup, click AGREE on the site and it redirects them to a site that downloads the certificate and shows screenshots and instructions for importing it. After importing it, they connect to the FSD network, type in their AD username and password, then, boom! They are now on the Student-Wireless VLAN and can do their assignments.\n Scenario #2: A teacher needs a Chromecast setup to cast to their TV. I take the physical address written on the back, log in to my server and register the device. On the setup wizard for the Chromecast, I join FSD_Unsecured and am now on the TV VLAN.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Nbommersbach  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n We are facing an a scalability limitation on our ACI fabric due to our implementation and I am curious if someone has seen a fabric above the Cisco advised \"limit\".\n Here is a short story, what we have, and we are facing. We are running ACI version 4.2, which is acting as the transit for an NSX-T platform. Due to the implementation of the NSX solution, all of the ESXi hosts are both compute and edge nodes. So, the Edge VMs can shuffle around on the whole ESXi cluster. What this causes in 4.2 ACI, that we need to configure connected ESXi hosts * 2 BGP connectivity profile on each leaf of ours.\n Now this can be fixed with floating L3out on ACI version 5.2, but currently we are in the middle of APIC upgrade and then Fabric upgrade is next. (Corporate politics postponed this longer than should have).\n We realized as a new customer is coming, that we are getting to the advised limit by Cisco on 4.2 ACI.Verified Scalability Guide for Cisco APIC, Release 4.2(2), Multi-Site, Release 2.2(2), and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-Mode Switches, Release 14.2(2) - CiscoNumber of BGP/OSPF/EIGRP session per L3 fabric are 3000.\n https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/5x/verified-scalability/cisco-aci-verified-scalability-guide-521.html\n 5.2 Jumps to 10000.\n We asked Cisco and the answer was kind enough to say \"Yeah, the huge jump to 10000 is because, we tested with 10000, and we just tested 5.2 more than 4.2\".\n This doesn't necessarily gives us the answer we were hoping for. Basically, we would like to know if someone faced this amount of configured BGP connections and went beyond the \"limit\". We would like to know if any stability in the fabric occurred.\n    submitted by    /u/Storma9eddon  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n Lately I have been struggling to choose the right layer 2 vendor (Cisco, Meraki, Ubiquiti Unifi, etc.) for SMB customers who own many switches (let's say 20-30) and want central management for those devices so that you don't have to SSH/Telnet to each every time you want to add a VLAN o change a port.\n I really line the simple pane of glass that Fortinet or Sophos gives you to manage Firewall/Router+Switching+APs but usually HW is too expensive for smaller customers.\n I like Ubiquiti Unifi's APs but switches are very very limited and, as far as I see, don't support stacking for Spine-Leaf design with the core switch formed by two or more stacked switches. The controller approach works very well for the APs and switches, but the later are somewhat still lacking features.\n Has anyone tried Cisco Business Dashboard? Does it really solve the issue to manage and monitor all your local switches from one place? Are the switches good for \"prosumer\" customers (they look like SF/SG replacements)\n Any other solution you hace tried to solve this that does not involve an enterprice plataform like HPE IMC or Cisco Prime?\n ​\n Thanks.\n J.M.\n    submitted by    /u/garciacarral  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are hub and spoke, with the datacenter in the basement and four closets, one on each of three upper floors with the fourth in an wing off the 1st floor. \n Previous guy put in multimode fiber to all the IDFs, and it's only OM1. That was over 20 years ago. I'm pushing gigabit over it without issue, but want to go to 10g this year and work towards 25g in the near future, with 100g in the next ten years. So I'm planning to bring in contractors for a rip and replace, out with the multi and in with single mode.\n Question is, how many strands? I know could push 100s of gigs over a single strand, but that is $$$$$ carrier grade stuff... I'm looking for something more in the practical range, so that is duplex LC, or MPO/MTP, for speeds of 25g to 100g based on the Aruba equipment I have right now. \n Looking at material cost, there's not a big difference between 6 and 12 strands armored plenum rated OS1. This is a fairly small job, short runs (longest is 400 meters). So labor is going to be more expensive than materials by my estimate. Looking at bulk cabling, I also see pre-terminated MPO/MTP 12 strand cable. Paired with fiber tray cassettes that accept MPO and break out into six duplex LC connectors, it seems to make sense for a degree of future proofing. I can use the LC breakout in the short term, and the higher density MPO connection is there for the future. The cassette system also seems nice, I can change the breakout if needed, without having to splice anything new.\n What would the downside of 12 strand be over 6 strand? Is there a downside to MPO vs LC terminations on the cable itself. Is there a downside to a breakout cassette versus spliced terminations?\n    submitted by    /u/gordonthree  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This might be an r/sysadmin question, but I figure it's more of a network question because it deals with 802.1X and device authentication:\n Currently wrapping up work on 802.1X authentication for a client and we're using Windows NPS to authenticate MAC addresses for those few devices that either don't have certificate support or are too old to use modern encryption standards (please no comments about how this is bad practice - we know, but we're forced to play the hand we're dealt...)\n For MAC address authentication, this requires creating user objects where both the username and password are the MAC address in question. This works fine.\n However, I'd like to plan ahead and not have to bug the client every quarter to find out which of these MACs aren't needed anymore. Basically, if a device doesn't re-authenticate w/in 7 days, I want to have to manually add it back.\n Even though these MAC addresses are basically AD user accounts, when they're authenticated by NPS, none of their AD properties change, so I can't just poll the last login date. Right now, I'm working on some powershell to scrape 7 days of event logs and remove anything without a successful NPS login. This should work, but I feel like this might be 'hard mode', so to speak.

My understanding is that the other end is trunking and im doing access port so it's expected behavior. \n Now can someone confirm if I'm understanding this correctly and why this is working fine when connected to a router port?

          "description": "About 5 years ago I set up a small network for a restaurant in the Caribbean. They wanted some IP cameras, a POS system and a slot machine server installed. I used an inexpensive Netgear router, an unmanaged POE switch and an LTE box for internet. All cabling was Cat 5e. A year later they wanted to add a guest network for the adjacent hotel. I set this up, but used a completely separate network infrastructure. I used ubiquity APs due to budget constraints. My thought at the time was by separating the two networks, it would keep the business network bandwidth more secure and wouldn’t bog down the cameras with the guest network traffic. \n Currently the business is expanding, adding several more buildings to the property, creating a campus like environment. They want Internet and cameras on all these new buildings. Since I have these two separate networks, I’m starting to realize that it’s going to be much more expensive and redundant putting two sets of switches for every building. Also a couple of the buildings are across a road with very rocky soil. Max distance between buildings is about 110 feet. I want to know the best way to proceed with this project. I have a few questions:\n 1) How are networks designed for say college campuses or hotels with several buildings when it comes to critical networks and simple Wi-Fi? Do they separate things?\n 2) Is there any reason to keep the two networks separate in my case.\n 3) What is the best way to segregate the network traffic, forming a more secure, prioritized network for the POS and camera, and a less secure network for guest WIFI?\n 4) I want to use fiber to span the buildings, but If I am forced to use PTP wireless bridges (due to very rocky soil), can I use one PTP bridge to support 2 vlans?\n Thank you in advance for your help. As I am still a novice at this, problems like this are a great way to learn about this industry.\n    submitted by    /u/Stevogangstar  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are coming from a stable and reasonably complicated network with IP routing to the access layer and separate VLANs and subnets on every switch for distinct devices types. \n We are looking at ways we can build upon our existing design and stability but take advantage of features that fabric that mean we can change the design to suit each system. One thing that interests me is the possibility to move back to having L2 segments spanned across the entire estate and assigning a /24 subnet for a particular system such as CCTV. We can then give the service owner the /24 and tell them wherever they install their devices they will sit on the same subnet and if the system doesn't work they can't complain about devices not working over L3 when communicating with each other etc. \n One of the problems with this approach is deciding where to put the gateways, what to push to the firewall or to keep on the core. We were looking at pushing critical devices gateway to our firewall for most control but also I am wondering about VRFs/segments and controlling traffic with routing rather than just spanning L2 to our firewall?\n Any advice or tips appreciated on how to best take advantage of fabric without making a mess.

I'm an IT professional with a focus on Azure/AWS security & compliance. While I have some networking experience in my homelab, I'm seeking some guidance because of some key constraints that I have to navigate.\n Here are the requirements:\n  \nOne subnet for a POS system called Toast. This subnet is highly managed by the vendor. No \"unauthorized devices\" can be connected to this subnet. The vendor provides a Meraki Z3 router and an unmanaged switch. Downstream from those, there'll be two receipt printers, three POS kiosks, and a cash drawer. Endpoints on this subnet will be hardwired. No wireless.\n One subnet for all non-POS equipment. For this, I'm planning on purchasing a Meraki Go Router Firewall and a Meraki Go Access Point. Endpoints on this network will all be wireless. No hardwired. \n  \nWe'll have five static IP addresses available. The kicker is that Toast POS explicitly forbids the presence of an intermediate device between the ISP's gateway and their router. Normally, I'd put a router firewall in front of the Toast POS router and isolate it on its own VLAN. Since I can't do that, I'm not quite sure how to create two subnets while meeting the POS requirements. Is it possible to connect both routers directly to the gateway, assign a static IP to each, and isolate the traffic on the gateway? I suppose that will depend on the capabilities of the gateway device. Comcast hasn't told me what unit we'll be getting yet. \n Just looking for some guidance here.

I want PC 1, 2, and 4 to be able to talk to each other 2. All PCs within their own boundary should be able to talk to the other PCs within that boundary only (with the exception of above)\n  \nI can not modify the IP addresses already assigned (everything is on a 192.168.1.0/24). I can change the gateways.\n \nI can not modify the switch attached to 1.50 and 1.75, assume its an out-of-box L2 switch\n \n I'd like to use ACLs to complete this by controlling the outgoing traffic from each layer 3 switch. (i.e Fa0/4 with an out ACL to stop PC5 from reaching outside its boundary).\n To my understanding one (of many) would look like (middle switch):\n interface FastEthernet0/10\n ip access-group TO_NORTH out\n !\n ...\n ip access-list extended TO_NORTH\n permit ip host 192.168.1.3 host 192.168.1.50\n permit ip host 192.168.1.1 host 192.168.1.50\n !\n I recognize there's an implicit deny at the bottom, that should cover anything not listed from \"leaving\" the \"boundary\". After I apply this ACL to the port, for some reason all traffic no matter the source or destination still passes through that switch, port, and ACL as if it was never applied.\n ​\n I think i've dug my mind into a rabbit's hole and have confused myself over what I believe should be rather easy.

These webhooks will make basic changes via Ansible, like update a port description or change a port's mode based on updates to interfaces. However, there have been times where I've tried to update 10+ interfaces at a time, which will then cause the webhook handler to take on 10 webhooks/execute 10 scripts at the same time. This seems to spike CPU usage for varying amounts of time, depending on the number of interfaces I attempted to update. The spike causes the VM console to freeze up and often causes some of the webhooks to not execute properly.\n I'm just curious if anyone else is using their NetBox server as a webhook handler, and if so, what specs it's deployed with to get it to work smoothly.

As it stands: I have a client that has a 1 Gigabit wireless bridge between two buildings. I have to move one of the Bridges in order to get it to line-of-site. Going up is not an option. I know you can buy Active PoE Extenders and daisy chain them together to get up to 1000 feet of ethernet (which is more than enough for what I need). \n I am looking to extend the ethernet around 850 feet. What I'm confused on is Active vs. Passive. I was going to use an Active PoE Switch to power the ethernet extenders (I would need two). My issue is: the Bridge is Passive PoE (24v). I know Active 802.3-latest is \"smart\" and won't push power to the Bridge, but I am wondering what to do from here. Do I get a Passive PoE Splitter? Do I need to get one that is specifically 24v? \n I am familiar enough with the 802.3af, 802.3at etc but I really need help understanding what to do at this point. And like I said, would I be better served to do something like an Ethernet to Fiber setup? I know I can get over 1000 feet from a setup like that.\n I'm just wondering what you all have in mind.

          "description": "A community centre I help out with wants to upgrade its wifi provision from a couple of cheap unmanaged 802.11n APs to something a bit better with centralised control and management. We're looking at about 5 APs and using a cheap L2 POE switch to power and sort VLANs etc.\n Traditionally I'd suggest an Ubiquiti Unifi setup, as while the hardware costs are a bit higher you didn't need to worry about licencing going forward. However their licencing model seems to have changed, and while buying the APs with a 3-year licence isn't too expensive, it does raise questions as to what the costs will be for renewals.\n Can anyone suggest another managed wifi system I could look at and recommend? Budget is an issue otherwise Ruckus and Meraki would be on the table, but I want to avoid the really cheap and nasty solutions as the cost savings would be wiped out in maintenance/service calls\n    submitted by    /u/WelshRareDit  \n [link]   [comments]",
