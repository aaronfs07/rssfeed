          "description": "SUMMARY\nIn 2022, LockBit was the most deployed ransomware variant across the world and continues to be prolific in 2023. Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in obse…",

The company uses Mac's which I am in the process of replacing and creating a domain. The users do not have unique logins at this time. The CFO wants another solution as he doesn't like OneDrive for file storage and neither do I. If we had a domain it would be easy to implement a file server with access permissions but since we don't have that yet I am looking for a solution. Does anyone have any recommendations on a good way to resolve this issue until the domain is in place? I know I could build a file server in Azure that everyone could access but then we have the security aspect of folders not being available. I thought about a storage device like Nasuni but again the folder permissions issue arises again. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.\n    submitted by    /u/mjaneway43  \n [link]   [comments]",

The issue I am running into is if a site was to go down at 3am my time (EST not that it matters) but i am sleeping. I have push notifications on my iphone, and have them classified as Critical alerts, so it will even come through on DND mode. BUT i am asleep, so one notification sound doesnt wake me up. I need like an alarm going off that i must dismiss, or separate device to deal with this. \n I am hoping that there are others out there that might have a simple and good solution they have setup. I know there are enterprise level services that can do this type of thing, but I am a small business and that would most likely be too costly and unnecessary. Any ideas or recommendations to check out would be appreciated. \n    submitted by    /u/jbrownGSCG  \n [link]   [comments]",

On top of that, it bricked their Office 365 install AND broke their MFA so we had to reactivate their 2FA on all of those devices just to get it working again.\n -I have found some registry changes online to remove the toggle for new Outlook, but I am not sure if this is the same thing as the Windows Mail app seems to be gone on these workstations as well. While we ALL know one thing - end users lie lol, we also know Microsoft likes to use us as their beta test guinea pigs sometimes..\n ​\n -How TF do we stop this? so far it has only been a few workstations, but since it is bricking their 365 AND their 2FA, this could turn into a management nightmare and bury our guys fast. Anybody have suggesstions?

          "description": "As the title says. You can't fleece or finesse your way getting local, high-skilled techs to do your work for you, run your business, onboard clients and expect to streamline your work in a matter of a few years, while sitting back drinking, snorting powder, or whatever pipe dreams you have. It may work for a little while, but you will eventually end up with employees, and clients alike, who will devalue your business to its demise. \n Where I'm from there's a toxic culture of this at the moment. Just because you started your IT career in 08 doesn't quantify your business for 15 years in service with a solid client base, when you decided to break off in 2018 and \"be your own boss\".\n Now, this is mainly for prospective employees looking to get into the MSP realm, fresh out of college, first IT jobs. Be very, very careful when applying and accepting positions for MSP's. Do your research, look up the directors and consultants and their history. If you don't, you will burn your resume with short stints at these failed businesses, who fight over breadcrumb clients with their empty promises of a seamless silver service. \n Always ratio the business in terms of current techs to managed clients before accepting a position - at the moment a safe zone and job security is 1:50, and may even move more towards 1:75 1:100 as more businesses go cloud. Anything less and you are only going to fill a void for 6-12 months and end up in the endless cycle of last in first out, as business goes through peaks and troughs at certain times of the year. \n This is not speculation, it's a reality.\n    submitted by    /u/EvolvedChimp_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm unable to ping the device, RDP, access it from the VMware web console and I'm unable to power off the VM.\n After about 5-10 minutes it will randomly be responsive again and I'm able to force shut it down/power it back on.

          "description": "Hey there! Just wanted to share a bit about my background. I joined my company as a network engineer about 3 months ago, bringing along my CCNP certification and previous experience in Cisco networking. Although I have some familiarity with basic Linux commands, my main expertise lies in the networking side of IT.\n Now, here's where things get interesting. The senior system administrator recently left the company, leaving me in charge of managing all the systems and servers. To be honest, I feel a bit overwhelmed and lacking in confidence. The senior guy still tries to help me out when he can, but he's got his own projects keeping him busy.\n The senior IT guy at our company has over 20 years of experience, and he's incredibly knowledgeable. He seems to have a natural understanding of all aspects of systems and developments. Technical stuff comes easily to him, so he never really felt the need to document everything. Before he left, he did his best to teach me, but I must admit it wasn't enough for me. I'm not placing any blame on him, though. In fact, I really liked working with him and learned a lot. I'm simply sharing my current situation and the challenges I'm facing in my role.\n Let me give you an idea of what I'm dealing with. I've got my hands full with various VMs, including a Perforce server, TrueNAS, Active Directory, PFSense firewall, NextCloud, and several customer server VMs. The thing is, I'm fairly new to VMware systems, Linux, NAS, and PFSense. It doesn't seem like the company is planning to hire a senior IT person anytime soon, so it looks like I'll be flying solo in the IT department for a while.\n I know I need to upskill and expand my knowledge, but any advice or tips you have for someone in my shoes would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/kus222  \n [link]   [comments]",

On top of all of this, there are serious communication issues.\n This is my first experience with an MSP so I don't know what's normal and what isn't, but 1 am being paid 35,000 a year for this and I'm about done. I took the crap salary for the experience and l've gained serious experience with Exchange, 365, ADs, firewall policies, dhcp, etcetera so it wasn't a complete loss.\n My issue is : I'm ready to take the experience learned and jump ship, but I'm scared that maybe it's just this rubbish everywhere.

She wants to upgrade most of them and try to reuse any useful parts from the old ones.\n In the past, she has had issues around user security and people messing up the devices. First thing I'm wondering is what's the go-to solution for desktop device management in small business offices where everyone is using Windows.\n Second, I'm thinking whether it would be a wise move to buy 1 or 2 excellent servers and just give everyone a Windows VM running in the server that they can connect to via a thin-client from their desks. Does this type of solution work well, or is it better to just give everyone a good dedicated machine running Windows for them to use?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/TheSaasDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

When opening the start menu and searching, the start menu is blank with only dots cycling near the top (like its trying to find something). We've had a case with Microsoft open for months now but they're basically useless.\n I believe the root of the issue in that ShellExperienceHost is not running. We've tried re-registering the application on the base image:\n Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register \"$($_.InstallLocation)\\AppXManifest.xml\"} \n If I try to start the ShellExperienceHost process manually, we get this error:\n The system detected an overrun of a stack-based buffer in this application. This overrun could potentially allow a malicious user to gain control of this application. \n In Event Viewer, we see this error:\n Faulting application name: ShellExperienceHost.exe, version 10.0.19041.1949 Faulting module name: KERNELBASE.dll, version 10.0.19041.2913 Exception code: 0xc0000409 Faulting application path: C:\\Windows\\SystemApps\\ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\\ShellExperienceHost.exe Faulting module path: C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dll \n I've tried repairing using SFC/DISM.

This tool should allow us to pick a combination of architectures (ARM, x86, M1/M2, etc) and OSes (Mac, Linux, Windows, etc) to auto-deploy either on a local server or cloud device. Once the deployment is done, we will execute some automation tools to validate a test branch of our software, report some findings, and then terminate the test device. The test VMs won't live very long; just long enough to run some test cases and record the output (via shared volume, etc).\n At this point, we are looking at a varity of deploment tools (LXD, Docker, Terraform, etc) but have not landed on one just yet. The important thing is the ability to select from a matrix of architecture and OS selections, click \"GO\", and ultimately get access to the test systems.\n Hope this makes sense.

Has anyone else felt like this before and how you navigated it?\n I could stay but i just feel stuck on helpdesk. The sysadmin above me was doing it for like 6 years before he moved up to more server stuff and projects. But i could only go up if someone comes under me or everyone above moves up 1 position but the company would never hire more people we been struggling to get a third in one location since i joined. \n I don’t hold any certs but studying Net+ at the moment\n I don’t really care for the end users and rest of the company but the IT teams are really great chill guys to work with.

          "description": "Hi all,\n this is just to confirm: the HPE licensing calculator for Microsoft Windows Server suggests that there is always at least one 16-core license pack needed for every physical server (they label this a \"base license\"). All the other license packs (2-core, 4-core, and 16-core) are labeled \"additional license\", which suggests that these cannot be used stand-alone.\n We are thinking about getting 2-core packs only (please do not ask for the reasons, since that is beyond my paygrade).\n Would it be possible to license a server using only 2-core packs? Are there activation keys included in a 2-core pack?\n Thanks in advance!\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/absolem  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here, I am the end user who knows enough to be dangerous.\n I have a beloved 4port DVI KVM that has served me for 15y+ and has outlived its own, and a replacement generic power supply. The manufacturer gives the spec as \"DC5.3V:5.91W:53BTU\". This means little to me beyond VxA=W, therefore 1.11509433962 Amp. I don't have a clue what BTU means, I assume it's some sort of pre IEEE British Tickling Unit standard for calculating time/distance/nautical speed/psychological moustache impact.\n So armed with this basic knowledge, I conclude I need a 5.3 Volt 1.11509433962 Amp DC power supply of +1 good luck finding that on ebay roll a D6 for No.\n However, the long serving recently deceased 5v generic PSU would suggest there are ranges and tolerances to device power distribution. As did a confusing and in hindsight extremely troubling conversation with my teenage era physics teacher which concluded with \"meh, over/undervolt by up to 50% you don't have to get all precious about it\". \n \"Sir..\", as I was institutionally minded to refer to him as a child of the mid 80s to 90s English school system, \"make sense, my autism begs you. It's either 5.3 Volt 1.11509433962 Amp on your own GCSE final exam paper, or it's chaos. Please which is it?\"\n So my questions is:\n Given that USB is 5v, and fast charging phone PSUs are not limited to the 500mA standard, and I have worked in IT for over two decades and have never thrown anything away, is there a chance I can MacGyver a solution right now in my home after an entire bottle of wine, or at least for less than a fiver on ebay searching for \"USB to DC multi connector cable\" ?\n ​\n Thank you all in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Echolalalalalalalia  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our SAN is starting to run out of space and we don't have the money to replace the whole thing at the moment (I can't add nodes because StoreVirtual is discontinued). I am looking for ways to free up some space on the SAN and the prime candidate would be to move our primary file server as it is using 2.75TB of space. The two VMware 5.5 host servers have 5 TB of local RAID as this was originally used for VM storage before we got the SAN. So, I am trying to figure out how to create a HA file server using this empty space. My first idea was to just setup two new VMs and cluster them but that requires shared storage which I don't have. Then I looked at Storage Spaces Direct but that requires some high-end network infrastructure that I don't have. I have looked at trying to setup some sort of mirrored storage in VM directly but I don't see any way to do that. Nor can I add disks from two different hosts to the same VM to do OS based mirroring. My last option is to use DFS Replication but I'm not sure how to do this without shared storage. I would also need to do a standalone namespace because of all the things that point to the existing UNC. Does anyone know if I can do DFS replication across a Windows Cluster or are there any better solutions?\n    submitted by    /u/CaynadianToo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought of using `mkisofs` and `dd` to create a ISO, but I am unsure if that would work properly. \n ​\n If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear them. I am currently a little stuck.

Why would I then need it on the domain?\n I feel like I'm missing something. What will I lose if I take Intune over using on-prem? what are the biggest challenges people have faced from going to Intune?\n I feel this one has made me feel really IT dumb for some reason\n    submitted by    /u/bruticusss  \n [link]   [comments]",

I do not have any experience with other SAML providers and therefore do not know if they have similar cert renewal mechanisms and how other relaying partys work with that, but I am guessing that a well-programmed relaying party usually should be able to check for both (the primary and secondary) certificates so that there is a grace period for switching? Or am I totally wrong here?

These users also have the option of installing Creative Cloud if required (eg for Photoshop, Indesign, Acrobat etc). All users have an active subscription, that includes Adobe Acrobat.\n For some users, when they install and log in to Creative Cloud Desktop, it doesn't always unlock the paid features in Adobe Reader / convert it to Adobe Acrobat (EG Combine PDF files, etc). In cases like this I usually have to uninstall and reinstall Adobe Reader/Acrobat for it to work, whereas with others it just unlocks and asks to install the extra features as soon as a user tries to do something requiring the premium feature. I am using the new unified installer, which is detected correctly as when a user signs into Creative Cloud it lists Adobe Acrobat as installed.\n Any suggestions? I did post on the Adobe forums but have had no response, so figured I would reach out to the community here.\n    submitted by    /u/jolegape  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I work at a doctors office. We want a Hipaa compliant app where our employees can text and call patients from their personal phone and obscure their numbers. Some specific criteria:\n 1) Only the Employee needs to install the App (or maybe visit a web link) to call (audio or/and+or video) and text. The patient can receive calls/texts like normal on their phone without having the app installed.\n 2) The Employee can make the call over Wifi OR their Carrier and still have it be encrypted. This is just in case their wifi is not strong enough.\n So far, we've narrowed down Iplum as the best compared to many popular ones. But the only issue with Iplum: the patient needs to have the app installed in order to receive text messages.\n Does anyone have any input? I feel like it’s kind of specific but figured I’d ask. Thanks for any answers\n Vsee is BAA agreeing but their free messaging protocol does not offer HIPAA compliance.

          "description": "So, I’ve recently discovered that all of our AVD images (win10 multi session) have a lot of questionable software installed on them from our previous MSPs before I started with the company. They’ve left a huge mess and installed Sql, python, ODBC, and basically a bunch of crap, with no GPOs, no locked down services or drive re-direction blocked, it’s basically a giant disaster. In addition, they set the VM session count limit to 20, with 32 gig ram and 8 cpu per VM. \n Firstly, I think the specs are way overkill, would you agree here? \n Second, the amount of bloat software on these VMs seems a bit ridiculous to me. A design to have non-persistent VDIs, regardless if they are RDSH or win10, should really not even have SQL, python, ODBC, and all this junk on there, that is designed physical endpoints or persistent VDIs. \n Thirdly, I spun up a few hardened VDIs with a baseline image, 2 CPU, 8 gig ram. Someone decided to upgrade all of my persistent VDIs to 4 cpu & 16 gig ram, because “users were complaining”, because they are Power Users that use SQL, PBI, etc. \n while azure monitor clearly shows a lack of resources even being used. \n Am I going crazy here? Thoughts?\n I’m thinking about redoing the multi-session gold image from scratch and doing it the right way.

We’ve got 4 rack servers all operating as hypervisors and a storage server(Synology NAS with a bunch of HDDs). 4 LUNs were created on top of these drives and each LUN was mapped via iSCI to each hypervisor, all the VMs boot and run from these LUNs. Also got a Microtik cloud router switch that connects all the Hypervisors to the storage server(1Gbps connections). \n My question: is this an optimal set up, having multiple VMs on each host sitting on LUNs? Is it best practice? If not how may I possibly improve it? I’m willing to rebuild everything from the ground up if I have to. Any suggestions would be appreciated! And yes I definitely plan to reach out to experienced sys admins to help with doing the actual set up but figured I’d also see what y’all think about this. \n P.S During a recent power issue on one of the hosts I realized that all the VMs lost connection to the storage server and for some reason the iSCI connection kept hanging without reconnecting.. this wouldn’t even be an issue if I was running the VMs locally (buts that’s just my reasoning anyway)\n    submitted by    /u/-zazu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I put 30 Windows 10 devices in an Update Ring for W11 but only 11 of them seemed to upgrade. All the devices were on and syncing with Intune.\n I had the Active time set as 08:00 to 18:00 so updates should automatically occur outside of those hours, right?\n I even had \"Restart Checks\" set as \"Skip\" since these are desktops (No worries about battery) and some of my users only \"Lock\" their PC and do not actually Sign Out. I wasn't sure if this would be detected as \"User Presence\" or not.\n The next day, I actually manually dialled into some of the PCs and did \"Check for Updates\" and the W11 update was there (Along with the Cumulative one for some but not all) and started installing and I was prompted to restart to finish the installation.\n The pie chart on the overview page isn't much help. It only shows there were errors with 4 of the PCs but upon clicking it, it shows each of the four devices on there twice, once as \"System Account\" once as the UPN of a user (I suspect the last ones to log in on the device). For the record, none of the devices have a primary user set on Intune. It even says \"Succeeded\" for each of the devices even though they were still on Windows 10.\n Any idea what I'm doing wrong here?\n Also, is the actual \"Downloading\" of the update happening outside of the active hours as well? In an ideal world, I'd want the update to Download/Install (Same as when you do \"Check for Updates\") during active hours while the user is logged in (To save on time), I'd just want the force restart to happen outside of Active Hours or if the user chose to do \"Update and Restart\" or \"Update and Shutdown\". Not too fussed about this however for now since I'm only deploying this to 9-5 users but will eventually have to deploy it to PCs that are used 24/7 with only random 1-2 hour breaks in between use.\n    submitted by    /u/RealAgent0  \n [link]   [comments]",

She then goes on a rant on how it’s stupid she can’t login to her own computer and that the IT company should be responsible for remembering everyone’s password blah blah blah, any way this continues for 20 minutes, and then randomly she goes ok I am in. I asked her how, and she nonchalantly says, oh I just logged in as myself. 🤦🏻‍♂️. Any way I was able to take care of the issue pretty quickly after that. Anyone have similar experiences?\n    submitted by    /u/Lost_Reporter_1962  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example i can store virtualbox VMs on that partition and be able to use these VMs on both windows and linux.\n I am currently reinstalling both systems to clean them up because I was installing alot of programs and stuff to learn and it is now too much to be cleaned, I also neee to repartition the drives with different sizes, but its not fun at all, takes alot of time and effort.\n SO, I was thinking that I can use my laptop as a virtualization server (with proxmox for example) and install both my systems as VMs and have all the advantages that proxmox offers with managing these VMs and their resources). But I am not sure how user friendly will this be for me, and what are the limitations of such architecture? \n I appreciate any suggestions or if you have other good ideas for my setup, this might become a thing in the future :)\n    submitted by    /u/DynamicResolution  \n [link]   [comments]",

I asked for a few days off in July a couple weeks ago, all of it denied. \n I enjoy working in the cloud, and scripting but I am getting burned out and I feel it. I feel so much stress. I struggle to sleep. I've always had my shit together, but each day I feel like I am losing control. I don't even get paid much for the stuff we do and am willing to go back to help desk with a lower pay for now, just no more stress. Hell, I even applied for simple sale's jobs. I don't know what to do anymore to be honest. Market also sucks kind of. Been getting interviews and make it to the last round but always get the 'We have decided to move forward with other better candidates. Good luck'.

As a result, much of the work is done by me when it really shouldn’t be. I’m in school, but lack a lot of formal training. I’m more or less just the “guy that knows computers”.\n A user reported to me that their HP printer did not work. This is a printer that only this one user uses, and has never had any issues before. I try to print and the computer says there isn’t even a printer connected, so I look and it’s not showing on the network. I add it directly by ip, but jobs still won’t leave the queue. So I check the printer itself and it can print a test page just fine when I do it from the printer. I figure it’s a driver issue, so I get the newest drivers from HP’s site and it finally works!\n The problem comes when I report to my senior that I solved the issue and how I did it. This kind of thing usually does not get a reply from him. However this time he called me on the phone, which is SUPER out of character. He sounds super angry. He tells me that “printer drivers haven’t changed in 40 years.” And that we just needed to “direct the traffic properly next time.” He goes on to explain to me that this was a “big no no” and that future printer concerns should be directed to him.\n Where did I go wrong here? Like I said I’m not formerly trained, but I’ve never once heard anyone ever say that there was an issue with just getting drivers from the official source for a printer. I also did not really understand what he meant by directing the traffic.\n    submitted by    /u/AdditionalPossible99  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our policy for BYOD doesnt address this, so we might want to get that changed.\n In my opinion, if the user wants their work email on their phone, and willing to download and install the profile, it's secure, and therefore good in my books - who's phone is or is not being paid for is not mine to manage.\n I thought I would reach out to the hive mind and see if that aligns with others as well.\n ​\n edit: haha, BYOB.

We use MS Office 2021 Standard and Exchange Server 2019.\n I have made PS script which replaces data in .HTM template and puts it in Signature folder for each user in GPO. Then it calls Outlook.exe to apply signature for user.\n The problem is - my signature is made in MS Word as table with text and images. Images are hosted at imgbb and placed in HTM code. When i open Outlook and apply signature it says that it cannot load images from the source.\n My suggestion is that Outlook is blocking external links with some security policies or it cant handle images as links when applying signature to Outlook.\n My questions are:\n 1) What can i do to make images work without creating other files/folders rather than .HTM file? I have tried manually replace images in code with base64 encoding but it didnt help. Maybe i can generate HTM signature template with some external services.\n 2) Is there any other way to generate signature for Outlook users?

And it is slowwwwwww. Users are complaining about performance and when I log in I see it - it's ridiculous. \n However, I check the monitoring software (I use Veeam One and ProcMon) on the hypervisor and the server is SLEEPING! I've spent weeks scouring the internet for clues and I've tried several things but all of them have returned very little progress. \n Would love some input or guidance on what I'm doing wrong - I suppose the Virtual Switch is a problem (just tried swapping to SR-IOV today) but still not getting the results I should expect.\n    submitted by    /u/wtf_com  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently installed a fairly decent APC UPS here at my building, along with the NMC card, which I have set up to send me email notices if there are problems. This is working well. \n Shortly after configuring all of this I started getting fairly regular emails regarding the UPS switching to battery due to both erratic power, and low voltage. I've been investigating possible reasons for this including contacting the power company. A couple weeks ago I found out that a tenant in our building (warehouse units) has a welder that they use occasionally. I went down and talked to them, explained what I was seeing and they agreed to let me know the next time they were going to use the welder!\n Today, they called me and let me know they would be using it in the next few minutes, and indeed the notices started rolling in! So this really does seem to be the cause of the issues that I'm seeing.\n My perception is that if this is happening regularly, then something needs to be adjusted and fixed otherwise I can expect less life out of my UPS. That said, I'm not an electrician and I have no idea what could possibly be changed or adjusted to try to fix this. I know at least that the panel my UPS is on is separate from the panel the welder is hooked up to. But I would guess that they are both hooked to the same service connections back in a common point in our building. I feel like the guys with the welder are willing to help figure this out, I'm not worried about who pays for what at this stage or getting them to pay it. What I am trying to find out is what could be done on a technical level.\n Does anyone have any thoughts? Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Connection-Terrible  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the crazy part is the end users are reporting ZERO MFA requests on their end. They get them when they actually request them. I work for an MSP and its a number wide number of clients of ours that are being affected. Luckily its not more than like one or two per client for the clients affected. \n I know end users aren't getting notifications as I got a user to help me out. He has a One Plus phone and they have a nifty notifications history feature. He let me comb through his notifications (Luckily it was a device he purchased exclusively for work so there wasn't any personal stuff) and sure enough not a single notification of an MFA request outside of ones he requested which I verified through the sign in logs in Azure. When you look at the logs I see CRAZY sign ins. Like one from Germany and the log says: \n Authentication requirement: Multifactor authentication\n Status: Success \n I'm really confused on how this is possible tbh. Initially my first instinct was a SIM hijack but that wouldn't affect the authenticator. Just to cross it out we've been having affected users call their carriers and nothing out of the ordinary. Then session hijacking comes to mind but the fact its such a broad spectrum of people affected in both locations and companies in general, it was hard to imagine that to be it. And I know that its not just my org. Ive seen a couple of unanswered forums on Microsoft forums and places like spice works. Its just becoming increasingly more common every day and its kinda alarming as thats the WHOLE point of MFA.\n    submitted by    /u/ParzivalLM  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our company also uses Azure AD, and I can edit groups. \n For each workload account (there are currently 10 and will be more), we want to have both dev and admin roles per account for users to live in. With this in mind, I thought of 2 options for AD/SSO integration:\n OPTION 1: Creating a user group for every role and account, meaning that there would be a dev and admin user group for every workload account. The drawback to this approach is the higher number of user groups to manage, but we could utilize AWS managed policies. \n OPTION 2: Using AD attributes (ABAC) to create custom permission sets that define a user as dev/admin, so that there only needs to be 1 user group per workload account, and dev/admin roles are determined through ABAC. The drawback to this approach is the initial set up of custom policies, but it results in less AD user groups to manage. \n Which option would you go with, or are there other/better alternatives?\n    submitted by    /u/optimum_hello  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please work with your domain administrator to ensure that the cluster identity can update computer objects in the domain.\n  \nNow, I've only seen this error posted with the \"Access is denied\" code, which usually is resolved by, well, fixing the access permissions that the CNO has on the other resources in order to update them. However, I fail to find anything mentioning my exact error with the incorrect password of the CNO account and a suggested solution for it.\n I've had a look at this with an external party suggesting we still work on the permissions the CNO object has in AD, giving it full control. But I like to avoid just tossing permissions at things hoping it works, especially because this error does not suggest a permission issue.\n I have found the following article, although without my error mentioned, but it makes the most sense (atleast for me) for the issue I'm facing: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/failover-clustering/understanding-the-repair-active-directory-object-recovery-action/ba-p/371891\n This suggests taking the Cluster Name resource offline and using the Repair feature, as this will apparently use the credentials of the currently logged on user to reset the CNO password and replace it.\n I'd like to have a second set of eyes on this, maybe someone has even had this issue before already.

Our print server is running on a 2019 Server Core VM. I can install the Universal Print connector service just fine, but I can't register it with Azure because it wants to open a browser to handle the sign in process.\n On the other hand, the connector service for Azure AD's SSO agent handles this registration process via Powershell. I can't remember which, but I believe I've also encountered one that prompts you to open a MS login page on your workstation and gives you a code to enter. \n I feel like of all the services to run on Server Core, a Print Server is high up there. It seems like laziness that the only reason the Universal Print connector doesn't support Server Core is because it doesn't have a browser to handle logging into Azure to complete the registration process. There's even a Powershell module for managing the connector (such as adding printers to it) after it's been registered! The UP team needs to talk to whichever team worked on the connectors for those other services and copy their registration process.\n Another one that seems lazy to me for similar reasons is the PowerBI data gateway. Once it's registered, I've never seen the need to interact with it again. It SHOULD be able to be run on Server Core but once again, it doesn't because rather than create a registration process via PowerShell they went the lazy way and required a browser based login.\n    submitted by    /u/Matt_NZ  \n [link]   [comments]",

Last night they responded asking for pictures of said capacitors.\n Today I got an email response saying that since I opened the switch case to blow out dust, my warranty claim is being denied and I should have called them before opening the case.\n I believe that this type of claim denial is illegal. So tomorrow I get to research the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act and find the ftc ruling that was made in 2015.\n Not sure if I should post the name of the company. I'll just say that several years ago they had LIFETIME warranty on their switches. \n Who else blows dust out of gear as routine maintenance?

I believe they were accessing sites for recruitment and used their main work email. \n I have some samples of the emails, and I can’t seem to find anything malicious about them. They’re legitimate, just extremely tenacious and annoying. I tried to look for a trend in them, so we could set up some rules to just delete them, but they don’t seem to follow anything scalable and they’re addresses are always different. \n I looked in the exchange online portal, and the anti spam rules all seem like they’re for strictly malicious spam. I might be wrong, but I felt they wouldn’t be helpful. \n I suggested that they just used the OWA to setup their own block/allow lists, but they can’t be bothered and wanted IT to do something about it. I’m kind of at a loss here. Is there anyway to get them out of this hole that I’m missing? Blocking the sending domains could be an option, but not all of them are things we would want to block. Like Glassdoor or legitimate recruitment sites that they and others might use. The worst is when the solicitors send meeting invites, they’re getting placed as tentative on the calendar. I got them out of that one with outlook calendar filters, but am clueless on the emails at this point. \n Any guidance will be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/PrincipleExciting457  \n [link]   [comments]",

Reviewing the messages, it is pretty clear one of the vendors involved in the email process had been compromised. \n The email thread looks normal. The vendor requested and sent an invoice for payment on equipment.\n Two days later there was another follow up urging the payment quickly. The vendor also requested a change in ACH information. You can clearly see the email domain changed at this point and the language has the feel of poor translation. To me there were red flags at this point and had I been involved I would have urged a phone call to confirm the validity of the message.\n Another recipient on the thread from another company involved in this large purchase even doubled down on the payment request. Technically he was fooled too.\n So technically our systems were never compromised. But we are the victim since we made the false payment.\n Whose insurance gets involved here? I assume next step is to report this to the authorities. (local FBI cyber field office)\n Our company has traditionally not taken any of this seriously. I have managed to secure much of the infra a bit at a time with MFA, good AV and better policies. But my scope of oversight has never been able to influence finance and other at risk departments.

          "description": "Hello, i have a question about Exchange 365 behaviour and hope that it's ok to post it here directly.\n We have to migrate distribution groups from one domain to another.\n The way we do this is to rename the old group via EAC and create the new group in EAC with the new domain OU.\n We rebuild the whole group settings, add the members and secondary mail adresses.\n But now we have a big discussion about the X500 adresses in the secondary mail adresslist if we really need them or not. \n Some years ago our exchange migrated to a newer version and therefore added the X500 adresses, the groups stayed the same.\n But with the completely new group and new SID, do we really need the X500?\n Does the new group will miss some data when we doesnt add the X500?\n Or do i have to update the X500 string to the new adress or sid for working with the new group? \n Thanks for your time\n    submitted by    /u/itipfelreiter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, Do any of you have a clear DR plan for what to do if an admin account in your Azure tenant is compromised?\n As I see it, a single forgotten service account could result in all other admins passwords' changed, and losing access to everything in Azure/M365.\n In my on-premises environment, if I have a set of backup tapes for all my data sitting on a shelf, I can (theoretically) always wipe all devices to bare metal and have everything restored, including identities, in the time it takes to copy the data. Cloud is not so simple. * Azure AD itself can't be restored, at least not with the same identities. If you lose control of a tenant, any identities are gone. And if you use Azure AD login and Intune with Bitlocker, your devices are all now wiped as well. Any configuration that depends on application configurations or managed identities needs to be rebuilt. Even UPNs wouldn't work, since you can't add the same domain onto a new tenant. * VMs in Azure can be backed up by any backup agent, but what about PaaS? If you're relying on Azure Backup/ Site Recovery, you just lost that too. Are there any good options for backing up files or blobs in Azure storage accounts? What about databases? Or Azure Key Vault? Azure Automation? * If you're using Azure services, you should be storing all your environment configuration in a code repository. But is it really all there? Have you tested a rebuild? And if you're using a cloud repository and logging in with Azure AD SSO, I have some bad news for you..... * For Office 365 data, much of it can be backed up, but can it be restored in a new tenant? Even tenant-to-tenant migrations with access to both tenants are spotty. In a new tenant, any identities are gone, and any permissions or groups would need to be rebuilt.\n Is there any product out there that claims to be able to restore your entire Azure estate, or should I just throw my hands up and hope it doesn't happen?\n    submitted by    /u/ProMSP  \n [link]   [comments]",

All workstations are Windows. No Azure AD in place.\n The problem is: Some end users that will need to be migrated to the new domain work remotely (not down the street remotely, but sometimes a few states away remotely). These users connect to resources over VPN, but the VPN authentication is tied to the domain controller that is going to be decommissioned.\n At some point during the migration the authentication of VPN is going to have to be redirected to the new domain controller. What I’m trying to nail down is what’s the best way/best sequence of steps to get all the devices on the new domain with the wrinkle of VPN being tied to the old one?\n There’s only about 15 or so people I’m dealing with, not hundreds or thousands. So even if the process is a little tedious, that’s okay. One thing I thought about is just switching the VPN (temporarily) to authenticate using some other method besides VPN before the migration starts, but I’m trying to see what all my options are.\n TLDR: upgrading/replacing domain controller, some users are offsite so their devices would be joined over VPN, but VPN auth is tied to old domain/domain that is going away.

I'm trying to figure an issue out and usually my google is on point, but I can't for the life of me figure out where to start with the search. \n We have multiple scan workstations on windows that need fast access to a NAS, producing thousands of folders with images on a daily basis. Current setup is old, not compliant with what we should have. Single user for all pcs that has domain admin and thus way too many rights for what that pc actually needs. But if I use a user without domain admin rights, the folder access speed to the NAS goes down dramatically to the point that a folder containing e.g. 80k subfolders doesn't pull the list fast enough for our software to work, thus crashing the workflow. With domain admin the entire folder is listed in a second or two, without it takes minutes to list.\n I'm at a loss what exactly handles this kind of file access and thus far only found out that domain admin grants the access speed and it's my goal to remove domain admin from that setup.

Since the original announcement, they've had 2 chances to setup their budget for the year to include the migration but many teams have just not bothered. We've gotten little to no support from our leadership even though we've been hit with a huge, multimillion dollar cost to keep extending support and licensing. They know we're leaving and are stuck, so they can stick us on the way out.\n We've alerted everyone to the fact that we are no longer doing updates to the platform and any security vulnerabilities need to now be tagged against the teams who refuse to leave rather than ours. We've also notified everyone that support goes away at the end of this year, even though we're already so far behind that we aren't supported anyway.\n What else can we do? I'm expecting our leadership to expect a Hail Mary if there is a production impacting outage even though we're ending up so far out of support it'll be a nightmare to fix.

I'm wanting to setup an MDM and ensure maintenance and processes are defined, tested, and documented within the two months I have to complete the project. I'm at the stage now where I can order some devices from a reseller I've been working with and make sure the auto enrollment and deployment works.\n My boss now wants me to look at a few other vendors to verify we're getting the best possible deal. I explained my concern regarding it being more important that our setup is clean and efficient in terms of management and deployment, but was told to hold off ordering anyways. Even at scoring something like 10% off its only going to save ~$2500. The idea that I have to redo my work with another vendor to integrate with ABM and setup drop shipping, waiting for the confirmation on their side, etc. to save that amount of money makes it sound like the more expensive option.\n Want to hear the perspective of other people and see what they do/how they would handle this.

The smaller site, lets call it site 2, with one DC and just five workstations had an issue over the weekend apparently, each workstation this morning after logging in had an error that they were connected to a new network and asking if they wanted to enable network discovery. Some said yes, some said no, some just left it.\n None of them can access the server by server name \\\\server2 and of course they only app they use accesses the server by server name.\n Did some testing, they can ping the server IP and it resolves, they can access the shares by IP address. Same thing is happening on the DC in this site. This also happens if they try to access a server by name in site 1. Everything in site 1 is fine by the way.\n Kerberos Event ID 4 is showing up on the server and the workstations. Did the suggested SPN duplicate search but didn't find any duplicates.\n What I did find was if I tried to ping the domain name it would return an IP address other than the server. It is actually just an IP address from the DHCP pool and not actually assigned to anything. This was happening on the server and the desktops.\n I went into DNS and removed that entry. At that point the server in site 2 started working and could access its own shares by name. Workstations could not so I rebooted them with no change. Rebooted server and it still works and so do a handful of the desktops. Some of the desktops still give the error and can't access by name.\n They give the same event id 4 in the event viewer with the name of whatever server we try to access. Ping is working on these workstations for both domain name and server name. IP and DNS info all look good. Not sure what to try to get these other workstations going.

          "description": "Hey there, Reddit community! \n Today, let's talk about Optimizing airflow and cooling in server racks. Here are some practical tips:\n  \nOrganize cables: Proper cable management improves airflow by preventing obstructions. Use cable trays and ties to keep cables tidy. \n \nHot and cold aisle containment: Separate hot and cold airflow paths using physical barriers like curtains or panels. This enhances cooling efficiency and prevents recirculation. \n \nRack placement: Ensure sufficient space between racks to allow for proper airflow. Avoid clustering them too closely.\n \nBlanking panels: Cover empty rack spaces with blanking panels to optimize airflow and prevent recirculation of hot air. \n \nRegular maintenance: Clean or replace air filters, check fan operation, and perform regular maintenance to prevent dust accumulation and ensure proper cooling. \n \nVentilation options: Choose racks with perforated or mesh doors for better airflow. Consider adding fans or ventilation units if necessary. \n \nTemperature monitoring: Use environmental monitoring tools to track temperature and humidity levels. This helps identify areas needing additional cooling or adjustments.\n \n Remember to share your experiences and insights in the comments. Let's discuss how you manage airflow and cooling in your server racks!\n    submitted by    /u/Timik_Enclosure  \n [link]   [comments]",

One such objective has this exact phrasing:\n ​\n \"Reduce VMware team size (xx% of our total costs) as we will have less and less VM (customers will go on XX)\"\n ​\n Now to the main essence behind this post:\n ​\n Cost savings and new vendor migrations aside (they need to be simply accepted), I just find it outright bizarre to be asked, as a technical team, to \"help us rationalize yourself away\". It's clearly management topics.\n What's your take on this? Management is taking the easy way out to not work on the reduction plans themselves in my eyes.\n Time to update Linked-in? :D :P\n    submitted by    /u/_ArnoldJudasRimmer_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been working in the web hosting industry for over a decade and currently hold a position as a Technical Support Staff, specializing in Linux System Administration, for a well-known company. It's a great company with excellent management, and I have a very supportive supervisor. Overall, I love this job and excel at it.\n However, I feel that the compensation is not sufficient, and I am considering relocating to another country in the near future. I understand that my current salary may not be adequate in the new location.\n My expertise lies in web hosting support, particularly with cPanel, DirectAdmin, and related areas. I would like to broaden my skill set to pursue a higher-paying job. If you have been in a similar situation, I would appreciate hearing about the field you chose and any advice you may have regarding additional skills I could learn alongside my current role. I also have proficiency in Bash scripting and troubleshooting WordPress, and I can develop basic websites. However, beyond that, I have limited experience. I have attempted to learn a few programming languages, but given my age (currently 32), I am uncertain if programming is the right fit for me.

I'm consoled in now, router is not dead, good. But WAN interface is down. I can see LAN is up then I notice another port that is up and is not configured.\n Check logs, it came up about the same time the WAN went down.. I ask the tech to move what ever is in that port to the WAN and.. boom, sites back up.. someone had literally moved the WAN cable into another port!! WHY?\n I tell the tech to ask them who has been in here (comms room) today, who was in here at the time network went down, why are they moving cables.\n The site managers response was \"well the wifi was running slow and that happens sometimes and what we do is we just move this cable from one port to another it comes good again\".\n WHAT\n No, seriously, in a technical sense it is completely impossible. I even reviewed config backups for a sanity check. There has only ever been one WAN port.

However at some unknown point it's started taking a crazy long time to boot, like 40 - 45 mins. It just sits on the spinning circles forever although you can access file shares on it during this time and some other functionality is working.\n I've checked the logs and a large number of the services seem to be timing out while starting. There doesn't seem to be a pattern though and they are all kinds of different services covering different things. When the server finally does boot, the following services are stopped:\n Distributed Transactions Coordinator\n Diagnostics Policy\n Network Access Policy \n But if you click to start them, they seem to startup without issue and once it finally loads it all runs without issue and seems 100% fine.\n The server has the Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, DHCP, File/Print and NAPS roles.\n It's an absolute nightmare to debug because I make a change then have to spend 45 mins waiting to see if it works.

I need to get a redundant/backup internet carrier at a very important site for our small/med enterprise. It is a warehouse location. The wrinkle is that we are leaving this site in approximately one year, but up until that time it is crucial that if one ISP dies another is available. Our current provider is actually the cable company, who has an enterprise fiber division. The only other provider in the building is the legacy RBOC who has fiber.\n I have been getting quotes through a telco broker who works with multiple different companies that use the RBOC as the last mile/loop, but they either refuse to quote 1 year or the pricing is very high (over $1000) even for speeds like 50 or 100Mb. I have looked at satellite internet services which seem too slow. I have looked at 5G broadband, but my hesitation is that they seem to offer no guarantee as to speed or performance. The fine print literally says there is no minimum speed. I need at least 50Mb up and down to run the business in the event of a failover. Another option is business (not enterprise) class cable modem, from the same provider as my current service. I inquired about redudnancy/separation between the two services, they did not get too deep into detail but admitted that they did potentially share some of the same equipment.\n So what would you do?\n A) Get the wireless broadband service, and hope it doesn't suck horribly when needed\n B) Get the cable modem and hope the services don't ever go down at the same time\n C) Bite the bullet and try to convince ownership that we should pay the $1000 per month for the backup service, which is more than we pay for our primary service. The internet in this location has not gone down for at least 5 years, but if it did and we didn't have a working backup it would definitely cost the company more than $12,000 if it was down for a day.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/moneydontjiggle4sure  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is this a normal aspect of the job that I have to get used to or is this unique to where I work. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/unholymoses  \n [link]   [comments]",

(or an auto-detect feature built into the vpn client)\n ​\n What I was thinking was:\n  \nThe VPN client when connected would work as its supposed to with routing policies and things of that nature\n When the VPN client is not connected it would monitor traffic based on policies and rules and when it detects that the system is attempting to connect to a resource on the destination network that is only available through VPN it would prompt to connect\n The idea is that people would be able to stay off the VPN and only initiate a connection when its required.\n Further it would reduce IT helpdesk tickets because rather than logging an IT ticket when they can't access a resource, only to find they haven't connected to VPN, the client application would pop up with a notice \"looks like you're trying to connect to your workplace, would you like to connect?\"\n The user could click yes or no and if they click yes then it would initiate the connection sequence (prompt for password, mfa, etc.)\n  \n​\n what do you guys think? let me know in the comments\n    submitted by    /u/roblu001  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For those of you who had admined Teams phones, you'll know that even with autosign in there are times the devices sign out. Users press buttons, bad updates happen, or in some cases they just seem to randomly sign out. Every teams admin I've ever talked to usually starts by confidently saying they don't have that problem before coming back later in the conversation and saying something similar to \"Well we did have a few devices sign out but that was because the password expired\" or similar. \n If you're familiar with Kari's law the basic premise is that there can be no barrier whatsoever to dialing 911. If it's a phone, you should not have to dial an outside line or take any special action to dial. But if you look at a teams phone, every single one says \"Sign in to make an emergency call\"\n How is that legal? I genuinely do not understand how, or how people are getting around this. Surely if an organization is using teams as a phone system with physical phones they're non compliant with Kari's law? \n What am I missing? Even with auto sign in there isn't a way to 100% guarantee a phone wont get signed out. \n I get that there's other issues here that need to be addressed. The need for cellular backup in case the internet goes down, or backup power for the phone system. And yes, I fully understand 'most people just use their cellphones', but I'm specifically wanting to address teams phones in this context because the way I see it, there's no way to be compliant with Kari's law unless you have someone physically checking each and every phone multiple times a day, even if it's in the hallway rather than being assigned to a user.\n    submitted by    /u/breenisgreen  \n [link]   [comments]",

We've used RANCID in the past but viewvc has been giving us fits for a while and Oxidized looks pretty cool so I decided to give it a shot.\n I installed it on Ubuntu and I got it to the point where oxidized is running as a service and I can see the configs it's capturing but I've been unable to get nginx working to access it on the web. If I'm understanding it right (and I may not be), Oxidized is running a local web server on port 8888 and nginx is supposed to listen on port 80 (and 443) and then reverse proxys web traffic to the oxidized site.\n Right now when I go to the server on the web I get a 502 Bad Gateway message and I'm not sure what needs to change.

          "description": "Everybody hello,\n Wednesday, a recruiter cab called me to asks if I was potentially interested in new offers. I told yes, then he told me he has a DevOps offer. So, I am working as system & network admin since 2.5 years in my company (its my first job, i'm 24). The thing is they were looking for an experienced DevOps, which im obviously not.\n So, they anyways wanted to meet me, yesterday eve I went to the company (~150 employees), they told me they were considering taking me as mid-time DevOps & mid-time sysadmin at the beginning to help me getting skills on DevOps, and after some months if needed, I would be a full DevOps.\n The point is they have also needs on sysadmin side, and Im pretty much experimented on sysadmin, so all of this sounds fair to me, the business looks nice, great office, great work schedule, everything.\n Does this offer sounds really fair? Is it a redflag? Is there something I should really be care of? Whats you guys opinion on it? (I am really about to accept)\n    submitted by    /u/antomaa12  \n [link]   [comments]",

I remember exactly where I was, what the furniture looked like, etc.\n Now every day when I enter my master password I realize how much time has passed. I'm coming up on a decade since and every time I get further from that number, my mortality sets in. I can't believe it's been a decade from that point in time.

Also, from what I can tell it's exclusively an image-editing solution, so the imaging part of the process still has to be done manually via making bootable USB drives with Rufus for example. I don't believe there are any similar solutions out there that can for example, image devices on the same network from a image repository stored on local storage?\n We have a number of clients with no on-prem server hardware that have fairly unique, extensively-customised OS images with a plethora of industry-specific software on top of that, and they are an absolute time-sink to reimage whenever one of their PCs/laptops is having issues and/or they purchase new hardware.\n    submitted by    /u/Severin_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm all for adding a little spice to the machines but you would have thought being such an expensive device ($3-5k AUD EACH) that they'd at least clean them before sending them out.\n Just wondering whether this is us (Sydney, Australia) or whether we've been feeding down from a bad batch of machines for the last 6mo. We're about to start direct-to-user'ing them with Autopilot and it doesn't exactly make it feel like a great experience. Never had this issue with any other vendor.\n EDIT: pictures of one we received this morning - you'll note the device hasn't been taken out of the plastic wrapper yet\n    submitted by    /u/slowsourdoughloaf  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think it's funny that other professions ALSO turn it off and back on, they just don't want to call it that. Like once my mechanic told me to fix an issue with my car we needed to unplug the battery for an hour and then hook it back up. I said \"So ... turn it off and turn it back on?\" and he was like \"no, no, not like a computer\" and I just said \"suuuure.\"\n Well this weekend I learned a new one. Saturday evening my heart started racing for no reason. I put on my wife's FitBit and my heart rate was 124, well over the 80 it should have been. I ended up in the ER, and told me my heart was in AFib. Normally when you heart beats, the top part of your heart beats first, then the bottom part beats. In AFib the top part of your heart doesn't beat, it just kind of flutters. For me this meant the bottom part was beating much faster to try and compenstate. \n I had to have a procedure, and the doctor described it as \"We are going to put a tube down your throat to get a better view of your heart, then we are going to give you a drug that will stop your heart for a moment, then we will shock your heart to get it started again, and it should start beating normally.\" I said \"So... turn it off and turn it back on?\" He didn't know what to say so I said \"It's ok, I am very familar with this process.\" \n So there you have it fellow nerds. There is nothing that can't be fixed without turning it off and turning it back on.\n (FYI, the procedure went well and my heart is back to normal. Also I ordered a smart watch that can detect AFib.)\n    submitted by    /u/letowyn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I never requested any info from them either.\n I've already told them we use a different stack and aren't interested in changing. Datadog is WAY too expensive for us already and I've read enough billing issues and \"getting bit by the dog\" posts on this subreddit dealing with DD on top of that.\n I mentioned that there is one monitoring element I haven't found solution for (big mistake). I work in the robotics industry so I threw him a question about if they had solutions for ROS monitoring. He said no. Ok so I tell him I'm not interested and hang up.\n Two weeks later I get an email from the DD sales guy saying he discussed my needs with a developer and wanted to see if i was interested in what they came up with. They basically began trying to sell me on software that was hacked together after 2 weeks and wasn't even listed on their website. I'm good. No thanks.\n Months. no more calls. Ah peace.\n Today. The cycle has started again. Maybe a new guy. Idk. Told him I'm not interested. This time I keep my mouth shut about ROS.They obviously still don't offer it publically. He sent me a calendar invite anyway. He said if you can't make it or if you're not interested, just cancel. Fair enough.\n Ok, so I just cancelled that meeting. Now I'm getting emails about me cancelling and trying to reschedule. \n I don't get it. I don't want your software. I already said no on the phone and email multiple times and cancelled your meetings. I have an option to reschedule too but, I didn't.

All issues have to be answered within the 0-2 hour SLA, including those reported by slack, jira ticket, email, and phone call. This is in addition to our normal 8 hour work day.\n The volume of calls generally isnt that bad (2-3 per day), but its the SLA bit thats chapping my rear a bit. To meet this expectation I'd have to set an alarm on my phone to wake up and check slack and Jira every 90 minutes or so. And on top of that we are to answer any helpdesk calls that come in regardless of time. \n Aside from the question of legality in my state (I'm asking a friend who is a lawyer about that), I wanted to get the opinion of folks on here.

However over the years I have found that users will generally tell you a problem only for you to try it and it works. There have also been times where you make a change on the network, something you think won't be affected is affected and you undo that change. Instead of explaining the process of what you did (because either the user wont care or understand) you say, it's fixed. Or there have been instances when you kind of made a stupid mistake and instead of admit your mistake, you quietly undo the thing and the user is puzzled as to why it started working again. \n I have been in IT for about 15 years in numerous roles and still carry a passion for it. I will passionately explain things to people if they will listen. For some reason though, I have found due to the environment and nature of IT, people either don't take interest or done care so you are sometimes left to look like you just performed magic and it is now working. \n I am just wondering if anyone else feels the same.\n    submitted by    /u/zodiac200213  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n I've got a real head-scratcher here. We have a user called Tim (not his real name) who's calendar seems to be causing some major problems for other user's Outlooks clients. When the other users have Tim's calendar added to their list of shared calendars, their Outlook grinds to a halt and uses 40% of the CPU and causes total system instability. Every 5 seconds or so, it says \"updating Tim's calendar\" in the bottom right before disappearing again. This continues constantly as it was affecting one user for over a week until they reported it.\n The only way to fix this is to remove Tim's calendar from their Outlook completely - simply unchecking the box to display it doesn't work.\n The weird part is not everybody who has Tim's calendar has this issue, it seems to be 3 users out of about 10 who need access to his calendar. But all users who have this issue have Tim's calendar in their Outlook, so I'm fairly certain the issue is actually to do with Tim's calendar rather than the user's outlook clients..\n So far I have tried; • Quick and full repairs of Office on both the user's and Tim's devices • New Outlook profiles for both Tim and affected users • Removing all offline and cached items from Tim's Outlook calendar • Checking Tim's calendar for any recurring meeting going for excessive lengths of time\n I'm honestly a bit lost as to what to try next so any suggestions are greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/bawta  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately, some stupid colleagues use it to chat to each other, also creating groups. Now that the HR noticed it, they want me, as the IT admin, to disable the chat for everyone.\n I think that this approach is not the right one, firstly because there are a lot of people using the chat in the right manner, and secondly because a tool like Teams doesn't make sense without a chat, for me.\n Now the question. Is there the possibility to restrict in some way the ability to create groups for some people or to talk to each other?

It's a full key man dependency with all the admin accounts etc sitting with me. I've argued against this for a long time but the business doesn't \"have the resource\" to hire a second or train an existing person to be the second.\n Now for the processes, that's all documented and ready to be given/read, however what do I do about admin accounts? For some products we have specific admin accounts, but I'm unable to give passwords/access because the person who is replacing me hasn't been hired yet, so doesn't have an email address I can give those details to. \n For some products, we don't have specific admin accounts as its licence based (tight company) and the admin just resides with me. I could make someone else in the team an admin but they won't have the foggiest what to do with it and when the new IT bod comes along they wont have a clue how to transfer admin rights.\n What am I meant to do in this situation?

We usually work on call in a rotation, work from home that week, and we are able to monitor everything and work for OT pay. Now its being rumored that they will not pay OT rates, still want us to work afterhours/on call, but their fix is to let us leave early, which is just offensive. Is this a standard across the board? Is this legal? When my rotation comes up, if I am asked this I don't think I can comply honestly, because it does not feel worthwhile to have my whole week sidelined, and potentially working afterhours (usually i hit a few calls but probably around 3-5 hours extra during my rotation) at my base pay, just wanted some kind support or some kind of resource or baseline so I know what I am potentially going to be walking into.

If you need information from a specific timeframe, you check your email alerts.

As someone with no prior experience in this domain, the vast amount of information available can be quite overwhelming.\n Overall i'm looking for a not too expensive setup to monitor our racks with a motion sensor and camera. \n We rent multiple racks in different data centers, and our manager wants us to monitor these racks 24/7. The monitoring system needs to operate effectively in various environmental conditions, such as cold/hot temperatures and low/high light sources. Ideally, we'd like a camera to activate and record video on one of the rack's servers when motion is detected. Additionally, we plan to dedicate a VM to manage the camera(s). Our requirements are relatively straightforward; we primarily need a camera to record any access to our equipment. \n I've come across several recommendations from other sysadmins, with APC solutions being frequently mentioned. The NetBotz Camera Pod 165 appears to be a suitable camera option. However, I'm unsure if it can be used without a NetBotz rack monitor. I've also noticed suggestions for the Unifi camera solutions.\n Those solutions are extremely expensive for what we need to do. \n ​\n  \nWould it be possible to simply use a webcam managed by the VM ? \n  \n​\n  \nAre there good open-sourced project you experienced sysadmins are using for this particular use case scenarios ?\n  \n​\n  \nWhich camera / webcams would be best suited for simply monitoring access to our racks? \n  \n​\n I'm truly fresh out from school, we've done some image processing projects in python so maybe in the worse case I could improvise a cluncky script that launches everytime the VM boots up ?\n Apologies for the novice question, and I greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations you can provide.\n Best regards,\n Ben\n    submitted by    /u/Ben_TrotFox  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not sure how wide though.\n - The device manager do NOT list the offending printer queue.\n - In Windows 10 menu -> Devices the printer is listed (several times) as \"Driver not available\".\n - If opened in the control panel -> printers you can not interact with it beyond 3 options: Remove device, troubleshoot device and (if I remember correctly from the client pc) properties.\n - Full Windows environment (Both client and servers).\n Tried searching the issue already and found out it seems to be a xerox-specific issue but don't really know where to start and still am kinda a rookie in many regards.\n Anyone had the same issue somewhere and know of a resource to fix it or to identify the problem better?\n    submitted by    /u/Appoxo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Whenever I try to publish my instant-clone image, I encounter the following error message in Horizon:\n \"Publish Error:\n Fault type is AGENT_CUSTOMIZATION_FAULT - Internal template vm-542704 customization failed. Error description not set by agent.\"\n I've already attempted a couple of troubleshooting steps, but unfortunately, the problem persists. Here's what I've tried so far:\n Removing AV software: I thought that the AV might be interfering with the publishing process, so I temporarily uninstalled it from the system. However, this didn't resolve the issue. See here; https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90781 \n Using sysprep instead of clone: In an attempt to overcome the customization failure, I switched from using the clone method to sysprep. Despite this change, the error message still pops up.\n I'm now at a loss for what to do next. Have any of you encountered a similar error while publishing instant-clone images in VMware Horizon 8? If so, I would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have to help me resolve this problem.\n Thank you in advance for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/neoengineer_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Looking for advice here. So I am a younger guy currently working in helpdesk trying to move to a full sysadmin role. At my company, Head of IT has always encouraged me to grow. In my performance review last year, he said he wanted me in a sysadmin role by Fall of this year. My company offers a bonus/certification program that pays for and gives bonuses for passing certain exams. So I have been taking advantage of this program and getting the certs as others have done. Others have gotten these certs and no one has ever batted an eye about it. In the past 2 months, I have been doing a lot of studying and got 4 certs on our in our certification program. On the last 3, my boss has been really slow to respond about them and follow up with HR/Finance so I get the bonus. Now, after my last cert I got, he emailed me back quickly saying to stop getting certs for now and he needs to talk to the CTO about it. Someone on my team got the exact same certs and they were praised for it, but when I do I am told to stop? I am just trying to grow into the role that I want at this company and I am confused as to why he wants me to stop my growth. I mean I understand if he doesn't want people taking advantage of the bonuses and then leaving, but I have been with this company the entirety of my career in IT (I am young so not that many years). \n I understand I am in a unique situation and I don't know if other companies offer things like this. Any advice? Am I overthinking? Should I ask him about it? All feedback is welcome. Thanks for reading.\n Edit: I don’t believe that it is budget or cost related. There have been other people in the past who have gotten certifications that grant bonuses that are double mine, and they were encouraged to keep going. I am leaning more that it is him wanting to protect the company and from people getting a bunch and then leaving.\n    submitted by    /u/TeaBagu_  \n [link]   [comments]",

We’ve been whitelisting the few public IPs for port forwards to our ordering and provisioning systems and creating the tenant/admin account and allow those businesses/admins to complete all their own onboarding for their users. This is quickly becoming not scalable though. We are planning on setting up an SSL Web VPN page on a Fortigate with bookmarks to the individual services they need to access but trying to find a solution for the Fortigate VPN accounts. \n Ideally we would create the single new admin account for the business and then allow them to create all their own users as they hire/fire. Trying to figure out the best solution for a Radius/LDAP server for the Fortigate to use for authentication that we can configure each tenant on and allow them to build/remove users without seeing the other tenants obviously. I tried to look at FreeIPA and it’s use of realms but that doesn’t seem to work as I expected it would. \n Our current internal Radius server is just TACACS fed by a MySQL backend which is fine for us to run SQL query’s for the couple of user changes we have per year but that’s obviously not ideal for this B2B use case. \n Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/g4m3r7ag  \n [link]   [comments]",

The original vulnerability, CVE-2022-21894, was patched in January, but the new patch for CVE-2023-24932 addresses another actively exploited workaround for systems running Windows 10 and 11 and Windows Server versions going back to Windows Server 2008.\n The BlackLotus bootkit is the first-known real-world malware that can bypass Secure Boot protections, allowing for the execution of malicious code before your PC begins loading Windows and its many security protections. Secure Boot has been enabled by default for over a decade on most Windows PCs sold by companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, and others. PCs running Windows 11 must have it enabled to meet the software's system requirements.\n An attacker who successfully deployed BlackLotus on a targeted system could obtain complete control over the OS boot process—giving them “almost the same capabilities as firmware implants, but without having to overcome the multilevel SPI flash defenses…or the protections provided by hardware (like Intel Boot Guard),”\n https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/microsoft-patches-secure-boot-flaw-but-wont-enable-fix-by-default-until-early-2024/\n https://www.itbrew.com/stories/2023/05/26/the-first-ever-zero-day-to-fully-bypass-secure-boot-on-windows-may-take-until-2024-to-fix\n    submitted by    /u/jpc4stro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand this is a time of complete chaos for a lot of companies and onboarding in our field is always a bit sink or swim, but this is well beyond what I'm used to.

We only have a couple weekend shift per quarter and all generally work 9-5 mon-fri.I'm working my first weekend shift and realizing they expected me to come in Monday.\n That's 12 days in a row unless I use my personal PTO(which i did for monday). That's not illegal it just seems insane and it is literally the legal limit in Cali. I've worked drive troughs, shitty retail, waited tables, gone from help desk to sysad in one org working very hard... I've been in the Army Infantry...\n Other than deployment and 1 BIG exercise per year for training, I don't think I've ever been expected to work 12 days in a row. Is this normal? I know tons of orgs rotate weekend shift, just curious if you get comped on the back end or not.\n    submitted by    /u/ThineHatBeRed  \n [link]   [comments]",

Dual Juniper switches, setup in a virtual chassis config - each model being 48 port 10GbE with 40GbE interconnects.\n In a small setup (3x VM servers and 1x SAN), why not do this? The switch can handle different MTU/Jumbo Frames per port, VLANs etc (so all storage networks can be on their own VLANs). In the virtual chassis setup it means no chance of config differences between switches. Controller A of the SAN could go to Switch 1, and Controller B of the SAN could go to Switch 2, so full redundancy.\n The VM servers would have 4x ports per server - 2x of which would be for VM traffic and their associated VLANs, and 2x would be for the SAN traffic. Again would go between switches, so a single switch failure would have no downtime.\n Can anyone give a good argument on this setup on why this shouldn't be done?\n    submitted by    /u/Efficient-Junket6969  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I will also be installing and managing four new Windows 10 office PCs (HP Elitedesks)\n Can anyone please advise any best practices to help secure and manage these computers. I'm not local to them, so will be able to do onsite visits every couple of months, but it won't be like popping around the corner to help them out. So anything I can do to help manage them securely remotely would be appriated.\n I've moved them away from Office and Outlook to web based GSuite. The CRM will integrate with GSuite through the browser. File management will be primarily scanned documents and saved PDFs going onto Google Drive and the CRM. \n Browsers will be Chrome, probably managed through Google Workspace, uBlock origin installed. \n Password management either via Google password manager or Bitwarden. \n Remote support is currently provided by Teamviewer, but I don't' think they're on a paid plan, so I'm sure that will get cut off soon, and so I'll give Chrome Remote Desktop a go unless an alternative good value solution can be suggested?\n Not sure if I should be doing any special configs with Windows?\n Is it worth having a dedicated AV in an office environment in addition to Defender? If so, what are people using?\n Any advise or links to best practices guides would be appreciated on how to approach a small business deployment like this.

I tried first by using a share on my host network, which did not work. The share was going to be USB attached storage from a router, and my DC could not see that.\n I then created a second Windows Server 2019 PC strictly for file shares (detailed above as FS Windows 2019). I deliberately put those on another network (using another virtual adapter) , thinking this would prohibit direct access by the clients. Both DC and FS servers can ping each other, and my DC server can access the share folder on the FS server, but Group Policy is not copying over the files. The folder created correctly.\n To create the folder, I'm using the path: User Configuration>Preferences>Windows Settings>Folders and created a folder here with the action being to Update.\n For files, User Configuration>Preferences>Windows Settings>Files. Same thing, I'm using the Update action.\n Again, the Folder creation worked, but the file copy did not. Why not and how can I fix this?

We’re a medium size software company and all our devices are managed by an MDM so until now we haven’t felt the need for a dedicated asset management solution. However, with the growing number of assets and additional controls expected from the accounting team, we’re now looking for a good cloud solution.\n With so many options and due to the fact that providers adopt different pricing models (some charge by asset, some per user, others per site) and also don’t publish pricing on their websites, I was wondering if you guys could help me with some basic info about the solution you are using:\n - Provider:\n - Your organization size:\n - Price:\n I really appreciate any help.

I've been asked if it's possible to export all data (Onedrive for business/Outlook/Teams messages/Sharepoint Online sites etc.) for some of these users, in case they want to access it in the future.\n As I've stated, since this is an education environment, none of these users had access to any data that would be considered confidential, secure, or anything like that. From what it looks like, there's no way to export this data, neither from their end, nor from the admin center. I did find something about using eDiscovery to do it, but we don't want to use additional licenses or software to do any of this, especially since this won't affect our operations at all. If need be, I'll just tell the users to export their messages and download all their files manually, but seeing as many of them have upwards of 50 or even 100 Sharepoint sites (mainly due to MS Teams, but also manually created groups), I can't imagine this will be wildly popular.\n Ideally, we'd like to know of a way for the users to be able to export their data by themselves, but I imagine that probably doesn't exist, so is there a way to do it from my end without requiring a ton of manual work?\n Thanks in advance for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/krystof1119  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A thought struck me the other day as I was doing some housekeeping in our AD: How do people go about cleaning up and/or keeping their AD's under control over the years?\n The backdrop for this question is that our AD is, when you go way back, originally from 2001. As such it's seen its fair share of server-versions all the way up from WinSrv2000, and I'm still finding remnants of such ever now and then in the form of old built-in accounts, various groups and even the odd dead server or two that hasn't been properly removed from the domain.\n How do people deal with this? Basically set up a new domain within the same forest and move what you want/need over, or do you spin up an entirely new forest with a new domain and then migrate things?\n    submitted by    /u/bukkithedd  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything works fine and everyone is happy, but me. There are around 5TB of data on that Synology. I need an affordable \"Synology in the cloud\". Where I can set users and access levels and have the data securely stored in the cloud. I also prefer a cloud in Europe - even better Germany - (privacy concerns) . What is the best practice for larger companies? I am very low on budget. I want to offer a solution that I feel safer with.

          "description": "This past March our company entered a contract with a provider that provides us with Microsoft E3 licenses. Along with this came some professional services that helped us finish an initial Intune rollout. \n On call 4of6 with our rep, I casually asked about the impact of a domain loss and name change on our tenant. I fully expected this to be a softball (I was hired on as a level one guy), and that my VP or anyone in our C suite would have posed this question at the beginning of our contract. \n My rep paused for a moment, knowing our situation with Intune, our current DC, etc. He basically said we might as well not even finish this call, and mentioned how little time we have. My heart sunk.\n Since starting at my company I have been trying to get us onto a more modern platform, one that is easier overall for our users.\n With all that being said, doing double MS e3 licenses for 7 months is a non starter for our leadership. \n Problem: we have ~650 PCs on old DC, most of which are remote and our VPN solution is a) sophos ssl b) not widely used\n My proposed plan: New DC: All new/current gen pcs are enrolled We redistribute devices on new domain Users continue to use old e3 resources on devices (office licenses) until we are ready to roll out name change and new tenant\n We have to be out of using our old name and tenant Jan 1\n My question: is there any easier way than this?\n Just about anything is on the table as long as I can tangibly point to a labor savings, and make it as easy on our users as possible. We can probably even talk about switching back to o365 and use those savings for some other solution.\n Thanks for taking the time to help a bit with this\n    submitted by    /u/jakeod27  \n [link]   [comments]",

I panicked and started troubleshooting. The server was up and running, and the network was fine. I didn't know what else to do, so I blamed our vendor. I sent them a WhatsApp message: \"Hey, what did you guys do? We can't access our ERP.\" They replied, \"We didn't do anything.\"\n I was at a loss. I continued troubleshooting, but people were starting to get angry and impatient. I remembered that our domain had expired on May 28, 2023, and today was June 2. The domain provider had auto-renewal enabled, but it was attached to one of our directors' credit cards. I called him, but he was still asleep. After 16 minutes of trying to wake him up, he finally renewed the domain. He mentioned that he forgot to change the card detail. \n I waited patiently for the domain to come back up. My phone could access the ERP, but my laptop still couldn't. I was about to start troubleshooting again when one of my managers said, \"Have you tried restarting DNS?\" I did, and it worked!

I've debated calling in and using a sick day, but I've refrained from doing so for two reasons:\n 1) It wouldn't help me feel any better. When morning rolls around, that's it. I can't nap during the day without completely spoiling sleep the next night unless I'm actually sick. I'm not going to be able to do anything, so I may as well feel miserable and get paid instead of feeling miserable for free.\n 2) We've got a small team, and I wouldn't want to let them down. I really like my compatriots, and if I'm out then my share of the work gets dropped square in their laps. If I can grab that phone call from the capo di tutti capi, that lets everyone else keep their concentration on what's important.\n I know that these sound contradictory, but it's a matter of taking the smaller tasks that don't require as much brainpower - stuff I've done a hundred times and is mostly muscle memory at this point - and either passing the challenging stuff off or sending bland updates that extend my deadlines.\n Basically, I'm asking for advice/anecdotes/etc. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/FrecciaRosa  \n [link]   [comments]",

Cluster passed the verification without errors, disks from the array connected without a problem, migration between machines works fine, but one thing worries me, when I run the get-initiatorport command in powershell on node 1 and node 3, it shows me nothing, while on node 2 it shows me all connections.

The problem occurs randomly on the servers and can be mostly forced by decreasing the hardware of the server to the minimum.\n Once i connect the following screen appears:\n https://imgur.com/a/xH4LtZQ\n checking the logs showing me a strange messages which not occour when the login succeeds. For eg:\n https://imgur.com/a/O1c1scZ\n On several hosts i moreover faced the problem showing a disconnected user using 50% of the CPU. Once i kill the high CPU process the session is killed\n https://imgur.com/a/VdQsxKa\n I appreciate any feedback or ideas to solve the issues. I already tried may things to rule out the problem such as deploying the image from a new clean iso, setting up the vm without domain join etc. Nothing yet helped me the locate the source of the issue.\n Regards\n    submitted by    /u/lufas7  \n [link]   [comments]",

One function of that application is generating PDF reports generated in Crystal Reports from data in an MSSQL database. This is a fully automated process, no interaction required.\n At present the function calls an SQL query, gets a list of reports to generate, then starts generating them one at a time before 'printing' them to a PDF file with the file name changed. This function currently utilises PDF995 which is slow and at times unreliable.\n This application (currently 32-bit written in VB4) is about to get an update to .NET and as part of this transition we want to move away from PDF995 and to something else we can 'print' a PDF to and specify the output file name as part of the process.\n Wondering if anyone here has a similar set up or knows of one, and can recommend a replacement software product. I'm open to anything be it subscription or a once-off, as long as it's regularly maintained and patched. TIA.\n    submitted by    /u/brettfk  \n [link]   [comments]",

This one and the main server are connected to a managed switch and both systems are in the same vlan. We have this setup at two different locations, only using different parts.\n At one of the locations, we discovered that network speed in that vlan slows down drastically when the backup server is shut down. After a lot more testing, we found out that this problem occurs with any NIC that is connected in 10Mb/s mode (tested 3 different systems, turned on and off, and manual 10Mb/s and 1000Mb/s mode, both full and half duplex, same problem every time). It's a KGS-1604 switch from KTI Networks. At the other location, using a TL-SG108E from TP-Link, we couldn't reproduce that behaviour.\n Sure, we could just replace the switch, but we're just some 10th graders from Germany, doing some tech stuff mostly for fun and getting some knowledge in IT along the way, therefore we don't exactly have a lot of budget. Most of our hardware was gifted to us or bought very cheaply from neighbours.\n But even if this is not fixable, we would like to know how this could even be?\n ​\n EDIT: Yeah time to say goodbye to that piece of shit, thanks for your advice guys, guess I learned a lesson today: NOT to buy THAT old hardware, no matter how cheap it is.\n    submitted by    /u/Leonzockt_01  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there, i have a customer with Intune Managed Devices which are connected to a OnPrem Exchange hosted on our end. The problem now is, that as soon as we set a shared Mailbox to auto connect to User Mailboxes the Shared Mailbox connects to the Users Outlook Profile, but than starts requesting a Password even if the user has full access to the Shared Mailbox. If we turn off auto connect for that Shared MB and add it manually to the Users Outlook, there will be no PW request at all. We tried, cleaning old PW locally and also recreated the Outlook Profile without any luck. The same happens also with a non domain/non Intune Managed Private device. Anyone has an idea where that behavior is coming from? Thank you very much guys!\n    submitted by    /u/Tweakz063  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't have experience working on a team this big. Which really sucks and shouldn't really be a factor. I have 11 years of IT/sysadmin and web dev experience.\n I've been a jack-of-all-trade type for about 9 years between two companies and my consulting on the side. I also have sales b2b experience for 4 of those years. I know how to pick up systems and processes really quickly and easily. I am currently teaching myself full stack development and cybersecurity concepts (since I want the CISSP by the end of the year). I have always been employed and am a good worker, yet these recruiters treat me like some unemployable person.\n The problem seems to be that I don't have a structured IT career progression and a lot of it is self taught. Mostly because I was the guy the incompetent managers hired to fix things. Yet somehow I am not getting this picture across to recruiters or they don't believe me when I say I work well with others. I know that there is some disconnect between my experience and what companies are looking for. I do believe it is the fact that I have never been in a company that was larger than 500 people. This seems to have hurt me in my job searches. Even though there was diversity, teamwork, irate end users and all that comes with any IT job.\n Is there any advice out there for a sysadmin who is looking to gain exposure to technologies at a large company? I am not dumb and I can handle sysadmin work, but why do the recruiters not want to hire you if you weren't in THAT specific industry?

          "description": "Accounting received a legitimate email from said third-party stating the invoice is due, then a few days go buy and they receive the exact same email again only this time the from email is off 1 letter, for instance instead of accounts.payable@xyzcompanies.com it's accounts.payable[@xyzcompanie.com](mailto:walt.disney@xyzcompanie.com). Everything else is identical, even the email signatures. There was also about 10 other emails copied so at first glance it's not really noticeable. After reply this was followed up by we changed banks, plz see attached for new banking info and then accounting paid it...\n We use o365, mfa is enabled and we even do semi-annual training with knowbe4 to be aware of this type of stuff. Now IT is being asked to investigate but honestly there's not really much we can do from here. The spoofed domain was recently registered and all the mail records are setup correctly so it slipped by all the scanners. Email also had a warning in the body that we add to be cautious as this is coming from outside the company. \n Now we are wondering how a scammer intercepted the communication and was able to phish it. We've seized everyone's laptops that were involved and locked their accounts. So far nothing suspicious, no message rules, no unknown logins, no malware. We are wondering if it's on the vendors end but even if it is I don't think you can really hold them responsible\n I guess this is just a warning to ensure your user base is well-informed about phishing. If anyone has any tips let me know. They are already trying to reverse the transfer but it's been weeks since it went through. They didn't even know until the legit vendor followed up a month later and said the balance was still unpaid. \n Said vendor also isn't a small fry and is a multi-billion dollar global company. Crazy someone can register a domain 1 letter off.\n    submitted by    /u/Intellivindi  \n [link]   [comments]",

He covered me when I took trips, and was my backup when I needed to bounce ideas or troubleshooting around.\n I, the net and sys admin, do 95% of all IT related tasks, and we lost our low level techs over a year ago, but we positioned in a manor where I can pretty much run the place alone. It's not a lot of work.\n Their isn't enough work for two techs of my skill level IMHO, and the management stuff is signaling that the IT reports, etc of the managerial role can be scaled down. \n So, idk what to recommend to the business, and quite frankly I'm stressed out. Can I run the place myself? Sure. Do I want to do that and never get a free thought to go on vacations unbothered, etc. No. But there isn't enough work for two techs. If I brought someone else on we would be twirling our thumbs and it would turn into a revolving door of techs I'm sure.\n What do I do here? Is an MSP an option? Do they help with windows servers, help desk, and Linux servers? I have zero experience dealing with them.\n Do I hire abother tech and we just shoot the shit most of the day?

I love the trouble shooting part of my job but the long drives to my work place and the physical wear and tear on my body are starting to beat me down. I have an extremely strong knowledge on anything layer 1 and have been working on passing a JNCIA cert. However I feel that may be a waste of time. I am toying with the idea of reaching out to a recruiter and seeing what they could find me and see if any companies are willing to take on someone like me to train up. \n I was originally a fiber splicer technician working ISP and OSP, until I got my current job. However I feel my current title is very undescriptive of what is expected of me. I work closely with our in house Cloud, Neteng, and syseng teams and have picked up small bits of knowledge along the way. I've attempted to move into the department but management of my department has a hard time working well with others and is seeming to be blocking me. I would love to get work that can be WFH at least part of the time as I now have a one year old and want to be around more than I currently am.

Due to budget constraints, our migration is slow. We have ~80 workstations and started replacing one every month in July of last year. The reason this is relevant is that we are going to have a mix of MacOS and Windows for a while and processes can't just be switched over.\n Here are a few questions that I have and any advice would be greatly appreciated:\n  \nBecause the office is primarily Mac-based, domain administration tools (AD, GPO, etc.) have never really played a major role except for email (on-prem Exchange server). This gives me the perfect opportunity to rework the domain setup to my liking regarding policies and organization. How have you approached this in the past? \n \nSome of our users have only ever worked on a Mac so they would need training right from the basics on working with Windows. How have you handled user training on the new OS? Are there any good user guides out there that cover Windows 11 from the basics and would be easy to navigate for tech-illiterate users? \n \nDue to the sometimes huge process changes, I find that a lot of users will try to tweak the new processes to emulate their MacOS experience, often making their Windows experience a lot more complicated and increasing frustration. How have you helped users adopt new processes and help them see that the new processes, although different, are more efficient and will make it easier for them to do their job?\n \n I know this is a pretty lengthy post, but I really appreciate any responses to my above questions.\n    submitted by    /u/Altus-  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now we are 4 employees (including me). \n The situation at the workplace\n I am focusing on everything IT-related. They have set up a domain network with 4 windows machines and one windows 2012 R2 server. The employees login through the domain meaning its dependent on the server to work. \n - Every employee has access to the other employees computer (except for mine)\n As some of you know Windows Server 2012 R2 is about to reach its end of life and so does the software we run on it. \n ​\n Suggestions needed\n Why even bother logging in through a domain at all? Why cant I just setup each computer individually with local accounts? Going with a server is just overkill and its just consuming alot of power (and is also getting very warm in my office). The software that the server is providing with the other users basically just needs a visible-over-network folder. Meaning I can just \"share\" a folder in the network with a smaller, not so hot running but modern computer running windows 10 and just share the folder with the other windows 10 machines. \n I think the server solution for us is just too much work and pointless in our current situation. Are there any concerns about turning the logins of my employees into local accounts?\n I didnt know who to turn to and reading this reddit has helped and inspired me alot for my workplace and I really hope it fits with what the community is about\n    submitted by    /u/PrinceHeinrich  \n [link]   [comments]",

But neither currently support sending out either SMS or phone call alerts to an on-call engineer (and we can't wait to see if they are building it). If everything else was A+ I would accept app/push notifications, but using the mobile phone network is first choice.\n The reason I bring up those existing systems is because a lot of tools out there (PagerDuty, BetterUptime etc) cover a lot of the same bases as well as the on-call alerting, so we'd be paying a fair chunk of change for features we have no intention of using. I saw a recent blog post about PagerDuty alternatives, but from my reading many of the listed products are covering the incident management portion (like incident.io), but missing the actual alerting via SMS or phone call (out of hours, when we can't expect engineers to be paying attention to the work Slack).\n This needs to be a SaaS solution, because we want to be able to alert in the case that our entire platform on which all our own stuff is hosted is having issues. Given that we're entirely in AWS currently it also shouldn't go down if AWS has issues.\n What products are other people using? Would you particularly recommend or warn against using it, or is it just 'good enough'?

          "description": "Our company is in the process of rolling out MS Teams to the organization. The direction is currently to deploy a MS Team to each department and then use the underlying Sharepoint site that is created automatically for that Team and customize it as their department Sharepoint site. So the department would be able to use the MS Team for Teams functions and open/link to the Sharepoint side underneath for all their departments Sharepoint needs. The Sharepoint would have permissions customized for different libraries and would also have things like Meta tags customized, etc. \n Here is the kicker. Every event, training and MS rep I have ever spoken with has said the cardinal rule of Teams is you do not make customizations to the Sharepoint underlying a MS Team It is more of the engine underneath and you use Teams to drive the car; however, a new vendor we deal with contradicted that and said it is fine and using the underlying Sharepoint is the way to go. So I am doing somewhat of a sanity check. \n So I am trying to crowdsource some real world examples of if/when this will cause issues. My opinion is we should be spinning up a separate Sharepoint site for each department but if I am wrong I would like to know know as well so I can grow. \n I did some searching but couldn't find many concrete ways that utilizing and customizing the underlying Sharepoint site for a MS Team would cause issues/break things but I wanted to do my due diligence before we set out down this path if it is the wrong path.\n So I thought I would reach out to the community and see what everyone thought. \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/FinalSysAdmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I am working on AD/Group Policy cleanup and organization and I've come across a few GPOs that are extended to our child domains.\n This is a bit new to me since the last two environments I worked out of did not follow this practice and would re-create the same GPO for each child domain.\n IE, If the parent root domain has a GPO for specific server configurations, that same GPO is re-created in each domain within the forest. A fairly manual task but leads to the creation of the GPO settings locally on the DC of that child domain.\n Now, I'm working with multiple GPOs that are extended, which is nice but I'm not entirely sure if it's ideal. I can't recall where I have read that this is bad practice and I can't narrow down why but I came across this Microsoft AD Design Considerations and Best Practices article that indicates it's a normal thing to do.\n AD: Design Considerations and Best Practices\n Based on the Microsoft article and it being semi-recently updated, I'm assuming that extending GPOs across domains is a normal practice?\n I'm more curious about the performance impact.\n On one of my child domains, I search my sysvol\\child.domain\\policies folder for a UniqueID of a GPO that is extended and I do not find it. This means that the computers need to reach out to the parent root domain for that policy, correct?\n While when I search for a locally created GPO UniqueID within the child.domain\\policies folder, I find it obviously. \n ​\n Any ideas or thoughts on this approach in managing GPOs on multiple domains within the same forest?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/N01kyz  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only thing that changed on their system was a forced W11 update (not my decision). Whenever a user opens a folder on the shared drive, it's extremely slow and crashes Explorer.exe after that, or it hangs in the \"Not Responding\" state. This behavior is present while in the office or with a VPN from their home network. This issue is not present for everyone, only for a handful of users.\n What I've checked and done:\n  \nChecked that network speeds are fine -> Everyone is getting 100+ Mbps up and down.\n \nChecked that system uptime is not crazy high.\n \nSFC and DISM returned no issues.\n \nCleared Explorer cache\n \nMade explorer run each window as a separate process.\n \nAll Windows updates are installed.\n \nAll \"Lenovo System Updates\" are installed.\n \nUnmapped all drives and remapped them again.\n \nMade sure that Defender are not scanning the network drives.\n \n The only thing that I've found out so far is that unmapping the drives fixes Explorer's slow speeds and crashes. These users rely heavily on these drives for their everyday work (Sharepoint migration is in the works but isn't going to be done soon).\n At this point I'm kinda out of ideas, can't even find anything to try.

          "description": "Hi, I'm having an issue with a Windows Server 2019 VM.\n The environment:\n  \nSingle Host VMware ESXi 6.7.0 build17499825\n 4 VM Windows Server 2019\n  \nOnly one of the four VMs started to crash, no changes were made to the VM.\n This VM has some administrative software that is used by end users.\n What is happening:\n  \nVM works, I can connect through RDP\n Rdp connection closes unexpectedly\n From VMware console, I can see the VM is still on but in the Sign-in screen the network icon has a big red X on it.\n When I try to enter credentials, it just keeps loading forever\n When I reboot the VM, it loads until I see the Windows logo and then it restarts automatically\n After three times it goes in recovery mode\n Tried all usual stuff from a mounted Windows Server ISO (chkdsk, sfc scannow, dism, rebuild bcd... nothing works)\n I restored the VM from backups and then I took a snapshot from VMware\n The issue is that I can't check Windows logs to find out what happens during the crash as the VM becomes unresponsive. I can only revert to the snapshot.\n When I revert to the snapshot I can work inside the VM until the crash happens again.\n It seems that before the crash there are no error logs in the Event Viewer.\n I think it could be the software installed inside this VM that triggers the crash but I cannot get proof.\n  \nEDIT\n  \nI created a local user joined to local admin group\n I was able to log in after the network crash\n I can see that under Control Panel there are no network cards, it does not matter how many network cards I add from VMware ESXi\n It seems like a driver issue, in Device Management I see a lot of unknown devices with warnings \n  \nAny ideas?\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/sbiriguda666  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry if wrong sub please direct me to the right sub for this question then\n So basically I've been thinking about this and still don't quite get it. Take a standard Windows 10 Pro OS for example. If the BIOS isn't locked by a password, you just enter it and boot into a USB drive containing a Windows Password Recovery software and bam, you got access to the admin account since now you got the password to it. If the BIOS IS locked with a password, then you take out the CMOS for a minute, put it back in, now the BIOS has been reset and you can enter it again without any password, and now rinse and repeat what I've said earlier. If Bitlocker Pre-boot PIN is enabled, then you can just crack Bitlocker with a software like John The Ripper (but that's way more complicated than just using the software itself, there's many extra steps to it and it can take hours even, but I'm not going into that coz that'd take too much time and space). So Bitlocker doesn't protect someone from knowledgeable people like IT forensics (working for the police), a BIOS password also doesn't. Windows also includes a lot of telemetry by Microsoft by default, so if you're super paranoid, then again it's not a good OS.\n I could go on and on about the many different exploits of the Windows OS.

If I manually ‘Run Script’ for that machine it will work fine. I created a package to be able to create a schedule/required install and it always prompts for elevation when the endpoint tries to run the script. If I take that same script and copy it to the endpoint and try run it, it won’t run because the script is not remote signed. I am unable to set the execution to unsigned or bypass because we have the GPO set to only allow local scripts and remote signed. I’ve tried this as a domain admin and get the same result. We also have used the PSAppDeploy scripts before with no issue and those have stopped working too. I’m quite certain that the -bypass in the script is not working now either when it tries to run. We have been running this same setup for years and have not had this issue before. There is one code sign cert on the endpoints from ‘Microsoft’ that did expire a couple weeks ago but I don’t know where that came from or how to renew it. All the certs on the SCCM server are valid (but none of them are a code sign cert). We do have a CA and I’ve tried to create a code sign cert to push but I haven’t gotten that working yet. Any ideas as to why this would all of a sudden be an issue or how I can get this working?\n    submitted by    /u/GeekFarm02  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here there's nothing like that: all the envs must always stay in a \"working\" condition, and every new implementation must be approved, analized, and green lighted ON EVERY ENVIRONMENT.\n I talked to the management about that and they agreed it could be important to have a destructable and rebuiltable envs for study purposes, something agile, but also it's not prioritized: it's literally the last entry on the to-do list.\n Here it comes my question: there's some kind of literature about the importance of having this kind of things?

My (custom) initramfs is build into the kernel which is signed and securely booted with my own PK in TPM.\n In the initramfs I have build tpm2-tools, dropbear and cryptsetup alike for decryption of the main rootFS, based on TPM2 PCRs/LUKS.\n Now in case any of the PCRs change the rootfs will not mount and I will be in a situation where I'll have to ssh in and decide if I want to accept any changes in the PCR registers and add a new unseal policy to allow luks decryption which more or less works fine.\n The challenge comes that I do not store dropbear ssh host keys in the initramfs, figuring they would be readable from the signed efi kernel by taking out the bootdisk and thus would allow mitm/decryption of my ssh session while manually logging in to fix the pcr/luks decription.\n This makes it so that I get the obvious warning that the host key changed everytime I ssh into initramfs.\n My thinking is there should be a way to get, or more likely generate, a fixed host key from TPM/PCR to feed to dropbear that would not live on the boot disk.\n Anyone have any suggestions how to do this?

I also have a personal Dell laptop, I can add that to my authorized device and access company resources.\n Brought two laptops last time I traveled and it was a PITA, hence wanting to bring only 1 laptop this time around, but want to make sure I isolate the company stuff and personal stuff completely.\n Thinking about the following options:\n 1. Bring company Lenovo, install a copy of Windows into a portable SSD, and boot from the portable SSD when I need to use it for personal. \n Pro is I can disconnect the SSD physically when I don't need my personal stuff to isolate it. \n Concern is if the company will be able to scan my personal data without me booting into the company copy of Windows(such as BIOS backdoor), and if it allow me to boot from portable SSD (this one I can test out).\n 2. Bring my Dell laptop, install a copy of Windows into portable SSD and add it to authorized device to access company resources.\n Pro is I think the company control for personal device is less than corporate issued device, or at least they claim it to be.\n Concern is my personal data will be in the internal SSD and they may scan it if I boot from portable SSD and not remove the internal SSD.\n 3. Bring my Dell laptop, install the company managed OS into internal drive, and install my personal OS into portable SSD.\n Probably the safer way, but more work and more PITA.\n ​\n Wonder what you think would be the best option in terms of data isolation from company IT admin perspective, appreciate any input you may have\n    submitted by    /u/osssssssx  \n [link]   [comments]",

In addition, we're starting to see the format pop up more often with remote folks sending in photos of forms with PII on them, so online converters are completely out of the question. \n Any help or ideas would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/pointlessone  \n [link]   [comments]",

Perhaps I'm suffering from working in a small company (just 100 endpoints), so maybe the products are better than my experiences so far.\n We are with Cybereason, currently on NGAV but due to replace with EDR in September. The support has been awful. For example, Cybereason is currently detecting itself (coreminion.dll) as being Malware (https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/). But only on one machine. I've seen other examples of legit software flagged on a handful of our endpoints, but not on most. It's just so wildly inconsistent, despite everything being in the same policy group, updated, and so on.\n Crowdstrike - looked promising, but awful sales experience. I've been blunt about how our purchasing decisions are made (we have an annual budget - if it isn't in that, it's not happening) and given windows when it's good to speak (i.e. two months before I confirm my budget for next year!). This doesn't stop me being harassed by calls and emails, including one rather embarrassing \"My manager said I'm in trouble for giving you this price, but I can honour it if you buy now!\" call.\n Watchguard - support was absolutely appalling, and their Panda EDR client trashed our Linux laptops.\n So, two questions:\n  \nHave I just been unfortunate with Cybereason - are those on the EDR or MDR solution finding a more pleasant time. What is your feedback?\n Are AV providers just shitty, or is it because we're such a small account? Would we be better using a MSSP?

What 'sometimes' works is\n ​\n  \nConnect-ExchangeOnline\n  \nConnect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName <your UPN> * New-ComplianceSearch -name \"suspicious emails\" -ExchangeLocation all -ContentMatchQuery 'subject:\"suspicious\"' * Start-ComplianceSearch “suspicious emails” * New-ComplianceSearchAction -SearchName “suspicious emails” -purge -purgetype SoftDelete/HardDelete\n This is cumbersome and does not always complete due to powershell errors and/or our team rushing to get it done fast. Last night it would not accept the 'purge' argument for reasons I did not determine. I also need to set the security to \"winrm basic\" to run this and then change it back again when done.\n reference https://www.codetwo.com/admins-blog/new-compliancesearch-new-version-of-search-mailbox/\n I am also trying to delete from Trace \\ go hunt for this message\" \\ \"advanced hunting\" and though I find the mail and take action to delete it, it does not appear to delete.\n What I am looking for is to the fastest way, ideally through the GUI, to locate all mails from a sender and /or subject and delete.\n Thx!\n    submitted by    /u/bjc1960  \n [link]   [comments]",

Straight up no, just drop the topic.\n b) Deadline is set. There is some serious $$ involved and I'm sure they would rather fail partly and fix it after the deadline.. but that would be my problem to fix later on , while they will put the blame one someone else. \n Another idea was to persuade most of project members to my ideas, but that takes time, which is running out. My question is how do you find a workaround in those situations and go with how you propose? \n P.S. and please, no \"CY@/leave as see what they do\", cause in the end, when the milk was already spilled and you get the blame or bad looks it's already too late, since there seems to be distrust whether you are capable of working on bigger projects..\n    submitted by    /u/Margosiowe  \n [link]   [comments]",

Forgive me my broken English also.\n Due to organizational matter, In my company we need to see/list in udadmin into our license server only the devices connected, not the users. Surfing for days around the net I understand that it probably depends on the License Type and on how are installed.\n The strange thing is that a couple of those device we have are already listed like this and they connect/show as device (thin clients) without listing the username as well. For the rest we use also windows laptops as well so we have a mix. We own a Citrix On-Prem server where the employees connect to their desktop via ICA/Receiver.\n Is there a way to re-install the license and associate it per device and not per user on the physical machine? Any hints? Citrix Inc. seems like to be very conservative and limited about it, and I couldn’t find much around the net.\n Thank you! 😊\n    submitted by    /u/Juggernaut_911  \n [link]   [comments]",

Looking back I was glad to have been there \"during the good times\" and was sad to see newer, younger coworkers not even have the frame of reference to understand just how much they were getting screwed and commoditized despite not actually being commodities. \n In hindsight some of the primary reasons the company got away with it was their \"thousand small cuts over time\" approach, and the total failure of employees, especially the older and more senior ones, to collectively push back in an organized fashion. I'm not saying to Unionize (and I'm not saying not to, either), but it's clear that todays Fortune 500 companies operate under the exploit and push until something breaks model of staffing and operations, just as they do with most everything else. And if you're quiet and kill yourself to make moving that goalpost successful for the company, then it will probably be at your expense.\n    submitted by    /u/systemfrown  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I'm playing around with PKI (mostly mostly client auth/sign), but I think a relatable example that most sysadmins will get is PKI use for S/MIME.\n Yes, you can pay $50/email address to some certificate authority, but many will also roll out their own PKI. It all depends on the use case of course, do you just need non-repudiation for internal use, or do you want outside recipients to verify emails.\n But it's 2023. Let's Encrypt lets you get DV certificates for free, but those certificates only support TLS server/client authentication EKUs.\n Why can't we have free validated S/MIME certificates (and other types of certificates)?\n Why can't we have our own CA for a domain, and have our \"local root\" signed by a \"real\" CA just like any other intermediate CA, so we can generate our own certificates that work on our own domains? Servers would need to also serve intermediate certificates that are under our control so the chain can be fully built since those links are missing in browser/computer root stores, but that's just a few extra bytes.\n    submitted by    /u/zachlab  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've had to turn off noise filtering a little while ago in teams to make it usable during long meetings. I have an email trail since November asking for a new laptop screen and dock stating the reasons and its been stalled ever since, every meeting catchup with manager there's a different excuse or blame on the further delayed merger talks. Latest is I've got a complaint on background noise in meetings which I argued I can't switch on teams noise filtering due to ongoing cpu usage. Told to move my office at home or tell my family to be more quiet. I'm at my wits end and looking for a new role as my boss is a cow.

The email SME did his research- it was Exchange- no external email. Someone internally email an attachment to a DL and none of those people in the DL claimed they received it, but mail flow and Exchange Reporter said they did. We were able to show who sent the message and when it was received by all the people in the DL which are internal as well.\n Fast forward to today and that department is sticking to it’s guns that the company email system messed up and the email just “disappeared”\n Really?! FFS are users this dumb? Not one but FOUR in the DL? What more do you want I thought? I was told by my leadership to find hard proof the message was there. So I did.\n I gave my adm account access to the mailboxes and logged into each one and found the message. The person causing the most stink- I found the message in their recover deleted items and it had been deleted four minutes after it was received.\n Now the department is blaming us because the file doesn’t have the right content- sorry that is not even remotely the IT department’s responsibility- please find another way to spin it how you f**ked up and don’t blame IT!\n    submitted by    /u/CaptainZhon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found where I can access these labels, but they are greyed out under Azure Information Protection. What we also noticed is that in the Outlook Preview the two labels don't exist. However this will take a good few months before this version will even be rolled out. Can anyone provide me with some support on how to get rid of the two labels in question?

We tried it from both sides and its the same issue. Did the direct connect mess up somehow? is it a onedrive app issue? We tried all the usual stuff like reinstalling the onedrive app to the latest version, cleaning the cache, even new installs of windows, we tried different users and new/old groups/channels.

To streamline this process, I've put together a PowerShell script that automates it.\n Here's an overview of the script's functions:\n Creates an MDM Key: The script generates an MDM key if it doesn't already exist.\n Enables Automatic MDM Enrollment: It sets up automatic MDM enrollment using Azure AD credentials.\n Generates Necessary Registry Keys: These keys are essential for the enrollment process.\n Initiates Group Policy Update: It forces a group policy update using the gpupdate /force command.\n Defines Enrollment URLs: The script assigns the required MDM enrollment URLs.\n Automates Device Enrollment: It calls upon deviceenroller.exe to automatically enroll the device in MDM.\n You can find the full script here: https://github.com/fKryptek/Intune/blob/main/EnrollToIntune.ps1\n As with any script you find online, I highly recommend reviewing it, tailoring it to your needs, and testing it within a controlled environment before deploying it on a larger scale.\n I'm interested in hearing about your experiences with the script, as well as any modifications or improvements you might suggest. If you encounter any problems or have questions, please let me know.\n Looking forward to your feedback.\n If you'd like to buy me a coffee for my efforts : https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bobbyhalford\n P.S.: Keep in mind, the effectiveness of this script may vary based on your Azure AD and Intune setup.

We have experienced multiple occurrences of memory leak on ACX1100 installed and would require reboot to be performed as workaround for the router to be performing again. Have verified that ACX1100 due to its design limitations, memory leak is occurring due to routes and/or routing processes which the router cannot handle. Would like to know if anyone have encountered the same issue and what has been the resolution in your network scenario.\n Monitored that memory leak on the ACX persists even after upgrading JUNOS from 20.2R2-S1.3 to 20.4R1.12. Verifying with JTAC, memory leak is triggered due to device configuration but the root cause for the permanent fix is due to software PR. I am still awaiting next service release for JUNOS 20.4R3-S8 to confirm with Juniper if memory leak issue finally resolved for next service release.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Aggravating_Ad5919  \n [link]   [comments]",

These switches are all running the Onyx operating system.\n We have deployed several sets of SN2010 switches for us and our clients over the past four years. We decided to upgrade to SN2100 to get more port density by using 100Gb optics and breakout cables. \n We configured a SN2100 switch and swapped it in for one of our SN2010 switches. \n This issue we are having is that whenever we connect a host one of the four breakout pairs, the port flaps every 30 seconds. We have configured the new switch port identically to our existing switches and connected to existing hosts that have Mellanox NICs in them. \n When we connect the same 10/25Gb breakout to another switch, we have no issues. We only experience the issue when we connect a host (server or workstation) with SFP+. \n We've used a 100Gb to 25Gb converter with both an optical transceiver as well as DAC cable and get the same results; the port stays up when connected to another switch (Mellanox or other brand) and the port flaps when that same connection terminates into a host (server or workstation).\n During the time the port is up, we have connectivity.\n Any ideas what this might be or what to try next?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/tmcmillan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n Working on an issue that is causing me a lot of stress. \n There are many sites that have been cut over to a new internet circuit successfully. A simple swap of cables and minor adjustments, and they're off to the races. \n There's one site that just won't cooperate. \n We cut over the site, and SLA monitors show 50%+ packet loss. Link itself has been end-to-end RFC2544 tested by the SP with no apparent issues. \n What's more, a backup link that goes entirely unused once the cutover is complete and testing is performed shows the same high levels of packet loss. This occurs only when traffic is pushed over the link; on idle packet loss is 0% across the board. The same behavior can be observed for latency and jitter. \n The existing link is unaffected. Regardless of a lower available bandwidth, it is largely stable. The backup link, if utilized when the original link is in place proves to be of a lower than expected quality when utilized, but it is wireless so there may be more elements causing that. \n The behavior of all monitored connections, including the unused backup link showing high packet loss when migrated to the new link is puzzling. I can only imagine that it would be down to electrical interference or poor grounding quality as I have tested all other elements isolated from one another to ensure it wasn't caused by the site equipment. Some hardware replacements or failovers have been made to no avail. \n The routing, switching, and new circuit are all in the same rack. The existing circuit is wall mounted in the same room. The backup link modem is in another room, but is connected by a single cable back to the rack and is otherwise not grounded. \n Would this be a reasonable element to look in to in order to troubleshoot the issue?\n    submitted by    /u/NotAnotherNekopan  \n [link]   [comments]",

I put the ISP line into a dummy switch that had a line going to the old network setup to keep the building tenants live and a line to the new setup so I can work on configuring the new network switches. I was working on adding vlans to the ports so that some only had the external traffic straight from the ISP and some ports only had network traffic for an internal trusted network that comes from a watchguard firewall. Everything was working great until I made port 1 (where the isp comes into the switch) a tagged port with the external vlan (999) and management vlan (1). The moment I did that, the switch lost connection to the cloud AND it \"broke\" the internet for all tenants on the old network set up. See the attached network diagram for more details. Now I wiped the GS728TPPv2 and removed it from the cloud.

For our business, it seems great so far given it can do per-packet flow over multiple connections rather than per-session flow so that we can aggregate multiple connection together for a single client. Being able to have a routed subnet is crucial for us given we host a few email servers, file servers, and websites out of our office. So, if we grab two velocloud devices and place one in our colo in the data center, and one here at our head office, are we able to propagate an IP block we get from the data center over the velocloud to use for our core router at the office? We have VPN connections, and lots of different configurations I'd rather not have to change and would prefer if we could use the velocloud to push us that routed subnet possibly via BGP to our router where it can pick it up. Is this something Velocloud is able to accomplish or no?\n    submitted by    /u/Shadow_Bullet  \n [link]   [comments]",

The core switches have \"redistribute direct\" set with a route-map that sets the metric to 70 and 75 so the connected routes get advertised to both the WAN and the other DC.\n I think what's happening is, the core DC switches see the route that was injected into BGP at the WAN router as an iBGP route and favours this since the routes over the etherflo…",

          "description": "I am testing different network techniques in a lab environment using RFC 2544. Something I can't quite explain is the fact, that MPLS Throughput is about 17% less than IP-Routing for smaller frame sizes (see below):\n IP-Routing: Frames Throughput - 76 bytes 25 Mbps - 128 bytes 43 Mbps - 256 bytes 83 Mbps - 512 bytes 96 Mbps - 1024 bytes 98 Mbps - 1280 bytes 98 Mbps\n MPLS: Frames Throughput - 76 bytes 21 Mbps - 128 bytes 35 Mbps - 256 bytes 67 Mbps - 512 bytes 95 Mbps - 1024 bytes 98 Mbps - 1280 bytes 98 Mbps\n The network itself is really simple and consists of 4 Routers in a ring. The tester sends the data to the input router that forwards the packet over one of the two transport routers to the output router and to the tester at the end and back again. The MPLS configuration was done without special stuff using OSPF as IGP and adding \"tag-switching ip\" to the interfaces.\n Maybe someone can give me a possible explanation\n Edit: Routers are quite old, Cisco 2811 ISR\n    submitted by    /u/ThunderbirdOP  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are looking for a cheap alternative device that can be used temporarily on each equipment when doing interventions so it may not require many ports since it will be removed afterwards, maybe 4-8 ports. I did my research, mostly found that opengear models are pretty expensive.\n Opengear ACM7004-2 has 4 serial ports RJ-45, 4 USB ports, RS232 compatibility and is relatively small but price around $800. I found several models like these on their websites but with LTE which i don't really need. I was searching for cheaper alternatives. For the Opengear IM4208-2-DDC-X2-G, i don't have the price but has 8 ports RJ45/RS232, 1 usbport and has some good security features.\n Lantronix SLB console server has 8 ports and seems ideal but couldn't find its price and much specs about it, the SLC 8000 has 16 ports but seems pricey on amazon around $2000.\n The perle IOLAN SDG4 has 4 serial ports RJ45, RS232 local console port but cost around $1000. Surely there has to be a cheaper one.\n Digi CM 8 Console Server 8 Port has 8 RJ45/RS232 ports and 1 console port RJ45/RS232, i don't have the price for this one but it does feature auth like tacacs and radius.\n So normally a technician would plug in the console server to an existing switch (depending on the brand of the switch, i will have to preconfigure the OOB device to connect to it) and the equipments will be accessible via the switch. Normally most devices in the data center have RJ45 compatibility. What do you guys recommend using for this scenario or if you have used those i have listed or a variation of it ? Btw i've searched most on amazon but there isn't much available. Some websites are genuine but don't list the prices which makes it harder.

We currently have visibility into the rpis, but when those go down, I have to contact the owner of the firewall and inquire about their network status etc which is extremely inefficient. \n Is there any way/what is the best way (I'm thinking quick and dirty because we have a long term solution coming but no one knows when) for me to monitor these switches without making any changes to the firewall and without installing anything on the raspberrypi (I don't have enough clout to get that pushed through). For example, if the switches support SNMPv3 could I send that? Would other network monitoring tools like Zabbix be able to send traffic from behind the firewall? Does it all just depend on the firewall settings? Also, we have one valid IP address to use on their network.\n    submitted by    /u/Careless-Coyote-8053  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Like many people starting out in this field I am from a Cisco background, but in my current place we are an Extreme shop, running EXOS series switches across each of our campus'. MLAGs are in use everywhere possible including all inter-switch trunk links. MLAGs were completely new to me when I started here, but I initially picked up how they work quite quickly, because I was previously using Multi-Chassis EtherChannel's back when I was operating Cisco 6500's in my last job. Lately though I've been tasked with migrating VLANs from old switches onto new switches, and I've run into problems where I've accidentally caused a loop to form by tagging a VLAN on the wrong trunk, which has royally pissed me off because this should never be allowed to happen. This is all because one of the things I've learnt regards MLAGs, at least where I work, is that we don't run any form of STP where MLAGs are used, because the two technologies do not work well together, which for us, means that STP is not enabled anywhere it should be within our campus LANs. My Cisco background has taught me you should never disable STP, and I completely agree. Why the fuck are we doing it like this? I'm angry and fed up of having my human errors magnified because we aren't running STP when we should. Yes, I know there are newer technologies now like SPB but we aren't going to be ripping up our entire network to change that now, no chance. I'm just really pissed off that this is the way it is.\n Is anyone else here an Extreme shop, running EXOS series switches, with MLAGs and STP enabled? \n    submitted by    /u/smartiedude  \n [link]   [comments]",

Remove the VPN tunnel from one of the edge routers and that edge router reconnects back to the pfsense box. Re add the VPN and the connection drops.\n ​\n We have tested each VPN separately and all works fine. Its like - once a edge router talks to another edge router, it kills all non-edge router connections. Very odd. \n ​\n So my thinking is there is some type of limitation in the edge os that is causing this issue.

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm curious what is the general consensus regarding the preferred underlay routing protocol to use in an ip fabric network that is made of 300+ switches ?\n From what i've gathered using a IGP like OSPF seems like the easiest choice given how simple it is to deploy and it would allow you to use ip unnumbered interfaces which reduces the complexity of the deployment. However you would end up with LSA floods anytime there is a topology change, but maybe that is no longer a big deal since switch CPUs and memory have become more powerful nowadays.\n On the other hand there is BGP it's less \"noisy\" allows for better administrative control of the underlay network, however it would increase the complexity of the network configuration although that might not be a big deal thanks to network automation tools.\n    submitted by    /u/ghoststalker2k  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the past I've worked with QSFP-DD and OSFP transceivers that had internal PRBS engines, but I don't know if this is standard for QSFP modules or if that would be a standard feature on the PHY's in a switch, and I'm still trying to parse the CMIS standard.\n Would it be as easy as just getting a switch like the FS S8550-6Q2C, and some different 1310 and 1550nm QSFP modules, or would it have to be done using multiple QSFP28/+ Evalboards?\n I apologize if this is off topic, but we're trying to emulate an enterprise network at layer 1 so I hope it's allowed, and i'll try to answer any questions to clarify things.\n    submitted by    /u/HexOmega10032  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a customer who is purchasing a large order of branch routers and requires configuration before shipping. They have a project where they need static public IP addresses for I think 12,000 devices. They've determined that port forwarding is not an option and of course there is no way to get that many IPv4 addresses. Problem is, the device we have to ship for whatever reason does not do automatic prefix delegation properly. Even if I manually configured router advertisements using the ISP's statically assigned network prefix, it still doesn't route properly.\n After a week of back and forth, finally engineering admits that the product doesn't support prefix delegation for the LAN side and that the only way to configure this is to use NAT66. I'm well aware of how NAT66 works and I'm aware that it serves no purpose in the IPv6 world. I agree that thinking NAT improves security is just silly.\n With all that out of the way, unfortunately I don't have any other options and we have to ship these routers out as working to the customer. I've read the RFC and seen some of the potential negatives of this, but I wanted to see if anyone has a real world scenario where a NAT66 deployment failed or caused issues. I don't know exactly the specifics of what this customer is deploying. Only thing they said was that they wanted 12,000 devices behind a gateway to have a static public IP address.\n    submitted by    /u/noCallOnlyText  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only information we have is the subnets the nodes could be on.\n The NMS system must have substantial discovery/scanning capabilities and be extensible, as we would like to integrate it with other systems (Nautobot or Netbox).

          "description": "We’ve run into a curious issue where it seems a Cisco stack’s PVST (could be PVST+, will confirm) BPDUs are finding their way through an RSTP topology made up of Dell S4048 switches connected via 802.1Q trunks and hitting the upstream provider’s Ethernet access port. \n The upstream provider’s switch turns their port to blocking mode due to receiving a PVST(+) BPDU on a non-802.1Q trunk, or so I’m told by the ISP. When we disconnect the Cisco stack from the topology, the upstream ISP’s MAC addresses appear on the network a few seconds later.\n Links go:\n Cisco stack (dot1q Po6) -> Dell S4048 pair in VLT (dot1q Po27) -> Dell S4048 pair in VLT (separate domain) (vlan 998 access) -> upstream provider switches.\n The Dell switches use RSTP, PVST+ is not enabled on them.\n Is it possible for the PVST+ BPDUs from the Cisco to be passing through the dot1q links (Cisco to Dell to Dell) and then finding their way to the upstream ISP’s switchports which triggers their BPDU protections? I’ve read an article (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/spanning-tree-protocol/24063-pvid-inconsistency-24063.html) which talks about PVID inconsistency.\n The ISP side has two L2 lines and spanning tree is used to control which line is used.\n    submitted by    /u/tdic89  \n [link]   [comments]",

We currently have an Active/Passive Fortigate cluster in place, however, below the Active/Passive cluster is our core switch which is a single point of failure. My goal is to make the core redundant, I was thinking of purchasing two Aruba 3810M's and stacking them via backplane, however, I have also thought of just not stacking them. Please see my concerns below and feel free to share your opinions.\n Network Diagram - https://imgur.com/tR00ax3\n ​\n  \nI understand that stacking at the core isn't the greatest idea, because of the shared control plane, however, we aren't a 24/7 facility, however, I do like the sounds of being able to update the core switch and not having to worry about the network going down.\n Reguardless if I stack or don't stack the L3 switches, will I need LACP to go from the Firewall to my L3 core switches?\n What's the added complexity with not stacking the switches? I believe that stacking the core switches and making one logical switch reduces config complexity, right?\n  \n​\n What do you guys think, should I stack at the core or keep the L3 switches separate? What protocols/technology would you put in place to achieve this? \n ​\n Thanks for reading my post, I am looking forward to everyone's feedback from the community!\n    submitted by    /u/Mysterious_Ad_474  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or is it easy to find/set what wiring scheme the PSE is set to?\n And regarding Passive POE, disregarding injectors, are they all set to on by default? It seems possible to turn off/on by the user in some models/brands?\n Thank you.\n Edit: Oh, one more thing. Haven't really dealt with POE devices yet but from my understanding of the thing, the POE controller needs power for the POE negotiation before power is made available through the ethernet connection right? Do you guys happen to know where the chip usually gets it's power from when a purely POE powered device is first hooked up?

Can't figure out why, and was curious if anyone here encountered this before or know if its possibly a problem with GNS3 and wouldn't happen on real devices?\n More detail:\n Small network I am currently simulating in GNS3 to learn more about how to implement L2LS consists of 2 spine switches (VLT Pair), 1 standalone leaf switch, and 2 leaf switches that are a VLT pair. OOBM switch in place for VLT backuo links\n I have 2 VLANS i am using to test routing. On each leaf switch I have two docker containers connected to it on each vlan. I am not yet testing any kind of VLT port channel from leaf switches to \"server\" just single connections for now.\n LEAF1-P1 -> SPINE1-P1 LEAF1-P2 -> SPINE2-P1\n LEAF2-P1 -> SPINE1-P2 LEAF2-P2 -> SPINE2-P2 LEAF3-P1 -> SPINE1-P3 LEAF3-P2 -> SPINE2-P3\n SPINEX-P1 are in VLT-PC1 SPINEX-P2/3 are in VLT-PC2 LEAF2/3-P1/2 are in VLT-PC2\n VRRP setup on SPINEs with virtip 192.168.X.1\n On Leaf1 I have a docker container with IP 192.168.2.50 trying to ping the docker container on LEAF2 with IP 192.168.4.51\n When that happens I get 3 duplicate responses.\n Basically what is happening is that SPINE1 (the main VLT/VRRP) gets the packet to be forwarded from VLAN 2 to VLAN4, and routes it appropriately. SPINE1 then sends that packet over VLTi to SPINE2, and then SPINE2 ALSO routes and forwards that packet. So the 192.168.4.51 gets 2x ping request. THEN, the same kind of doubling occurs on the response back ending uo with 4 responses sent to 192.168.2.50.\n Has Anyone seen this before? Is this expected behavior and I am messing up by trying to do L3 routing in a L2LS Network?

Right now, we have a nighthawk RAX70 router in the main building and that connects two outerbuildings, one with a nighthawk AC1900 & the other with netgear r6120 acting as AP's. \n What are the things I should take into consideration when looking for new routers and managed switches? I know I need gigabit ports. We have about 50 users spread out in these buildings that require reliable connection. I was looking into the Cisco router firewall plus gx50, but this does require a subscription. Also the Cisco 1000 series for the switches.\n    submitted by    /u/Administrative_Line3  \n [link]   [comments]",

This happens cross vlan, and even cross VRF - so on the whole router. We have isolated and can recreate and verify that the reason is a HDMI-to-IP AV device that is using broadcast. We can through inspection of the COPP control plane policy commands see that the router is dropping BROADCAST (Policier Queue 0) packets.\n I have to say I am a bit surprised to see the 9500 has default only 750pps rate limit for broadcast globally. How are people handling this and making sure bugged traffic, DoS or even just AVoIP devices doesn't stop DHCP relay from working \"globally\"?\n The traffic is not DHCP traffic, it's UDP 192.168.0.1->192.168.0.99, but the L2 destination is ffffff-ffffff. And port is not 67/68. I'm struggling to understand why the Cisco would even queue these packets for CPU handling?\n Anyway, I know I can rate limit the specific client and what not, but I want to know what is best practice for single users like this not killing a several 1000-user network..

Like the title says, we are trying to establish a 10gb link to another site via our ISP. The issue that we have run into is, our 10gb link is active and working, however we are only able to pass 2gb of traffic because all traffic going to the handoff device is coming from a single source mac address. Since it appears to be one source device, our ISPs link policing is forcing a 2gb flow limit. Would the best way forward be to add some sort of load balancer between devices that splits the single flow from the our device into 5 individual flows so that we can appropriately take advantage of the 2gb flow limit?

But from Layer 3 (4) and below. \n So service mesh enters the chat and addresses connectivity but at L7/HTTP. Tunnelling exists through mTLS, and Istio/Linkerd have their way of making this possible. Side-car proxies act as routers on behalf of containers pods and terminate at another side-car\n But what else does a service mesh do? - rate limit (qos) - traffic shift - load balance - filter by http request type - give us tracing and observability thanks to b3-header info (L7 traceroute) \n Of course there still needs to exist a TCP (and below) layer for all of this to happen…\n And DNS.\n So my two questions: 1.

          "description": "Hey all, hoping to get some info from PA experts from this sub.\n I am trying to understand how the self-signed certs on the Palo Alto gateway are trusted by the Global Protect client when they authenticate and sign in.\n Basically with one of our fw setups, the gateway has a cert that is self signed by the firewall itself. When we connect to the VPN, there is no ssl warning prompt for the cert being untrusted. \n I have checked that the root CA (also self signed by PA) is not present on the client machines. \n If this is the case, is there any significance of having this cert setup correctly? Does the client just accept the cert no matter the details.\n I have noticed, that when we first add the portal IP, there is a warning only initially but no warning when connecting to the gateway.\n I tried looking at docs but couldn't find what I was trying to understand here.

The company I work for has the marketing slogan \"single pane of glass\" network management but after reading through reddit feeds, this is a term people are tired of hearing.\n I'm sure most companies don't deliver on that term, making it gimicky and overused, but is there really a valid desire/need to manage through a single pane of glass? Many people I talk to are using 3-4 different vendors, so I'm wondering if it's not really a \"pain point\" to manage a bunch of different dashboards for different parts of the network or if people have just never experienced a true \"single pane of glass\" so they don't know what they're missing.\n For example, i'll hear: we're using palo alto for firewalls, mix of ubiquiti and meraki for wireless, and aruba and cisco for everything else...wouldn't that be annoying to manage all separately?\n Thankful for all thoughts and lived experiences shared!\n    submitted by    /u/CometotheJuniperside  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was wondering what you all use and have used in your campus networks for access switches, how they have been performing, what features they have, and the cost. I've been mainly using Cisco and I have found that I really just need a L2 switch with secure mgmt. If I could find a switch that just has basic L2 features and a few that might not be so common, that would be great. My access switches just provide connection to thin clients, VoIP phones, and printers, so I don't see a reason to spend money on cisco products and licenses if I can just buy something more simple. But then again I don't really know if Cisco is currently the most expensive route.\n Here's what I'm looking for in an access switch:\n -RSTP, (and MST if possible)\n -802.1q\n -LACP\n -PoE\n -SSH\n -SNMP\n Things that would be nice:\n -TACACS+ (or other encrypted mgmt aaa)\n -802.1x and or MAB support\n -HTTPS interface\n Just curious what is out there that might be cheaper. It seems like every time I put a new switch in place I just add the vlans, enable portfast for the hosts, configure username/tacacs, disable services, prune the trunk and if I'm feeling crazy double check the root bridge. I don't need VRFs, VXLANs, or GRE. I definitely don't need BGP or even OSPF lol \n Let me know what you guys use for access switches.\n (I'm currently using Cisco 9200/9300s)\n    submitted by    /u/John_Greed  \n [link]   [comments]",

The BGP peers do not like this, so they reject it in their BGP filters.\n Is there any way to workaround the above issue with IOS-XR?

          "description": "I've been trying to find a solution to a weird issue I've been having for a few days now, and this is my last hope. I've got a pair of SRX340 firewalls which I acquired in order to replace a pair of dell R330 boxes running PFSense. The goal here is to use them just for an IPsec tunnel into our GCP environment.\n As a precursor, the current PFSense boxes are in operation with one GCP tunnel each, sharing a GCP VPN gateway. When I run an iperf test over them, I can get up to 600mbps per tunnel. Plenty for what I need.\n However, when running a simple configuration in a test environment using the Google community guide for SRX devices, I'm only getting ~230mbps of possible bandwidth over the firewall. To be clear on this example, it's one SRX340 with one tunnel to GCP, dynamic routing, a gigabit WAN connection with a static IP on ge-0/0/0, and I have a laptop plugged into ge-0/0/1 on the device to run iperf3 over. Without the SRX340 in the mix, I can get 930mbps iperf3 over the internet to my test VM in GCP.\n My issue is with the 230mbps number. The SRX340 is rated for up to 733mbps of IPsec bandwidth, and I'm running the configuration given as an example in the Google guide. I just can't seem to break that speed barrier. Am I missing something or is this what I'm to expect out of an SRX340?\n    submitted by    /u/isonotlikethat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, I've done a bit of googling about this but haven't really gotten an answer I'm happy with.\n I've been playing around with Netbox to demo, and I've been importing our addressing and VLANs. My concern is with how VLANs are handled. It seems like it's not possible to say \"vlan 1 is globally Desktops,' for example, and have all org-wide site-specific Desktop prefixes be assigned to, and appear under, the same VLAN object. Is this correct? \n Right now I have (for example) a \"site_vlans\" vlan group for multiple sites, and an individual \"vlan 1\" assigned to each group/site. This is all well and good, but suppose you have 100 VLANs and 10 sites. Are you required to maintain 1000 VLAN records in Netbox? Seems unwieldy. \n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/pythbit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Happy Friday everyone, \n So, I manage a hotel's Wifi service. A recent change I made for them was to set their QoS bandwidth cap for their free GUEST wifi network to 10Mbps. After applying the update, I went to the hotels lobbies to test it out with my laptop. Interestingly enough, I'm getting on avg. about 4-6Mbps speeds and I'm also seeing that it will fluctuate from 5Mbps, then burst to 8Mpbs, then back to 4Mbps and so on and so on. I'm assuming this is normal behavior you see when you've placed a bandwidth cap on the wifi network, but I'm not 100% on this. If not, let me know.\n When I'm on the casino floors, I'm getting correct QoS speeds (The property is a hotel & Casino), I'm also seeing burst here and there but overall speeds are right on the money.\n Currently using Cisco WLC3504 with Cisco 2802i APs.\n This might be an easy answer for some of you Wireless Cisco ninjas.

          "description": "Hello all,\n I am working in a company which develops safety-critical application. The company (railway operator) which uses our system in the field wants us to join their already deployed MPLS network. In this case, we need to share the network infrastructure with other systems like CCTV, IP phone etc. Otherwise we are going to install our closed loop for communication between control center and remote equipments, which is a general approach we have taken so far. Our concerns for sharing the common network devices with other systems are bandwidth, latency and security.\n As far as I know CCTV data is prioritized in MPLS QoS. Can our safety-critic data be prioritized higher than CCTV packets?\n Also in case of a failure in other subsystems, may a technician misconfigure the MPLS router in a troubleshooting process so that our routing configuration also be affected badly?\n I remember that with RSVP, pre-defined bandwidth can be allocated to a specific tunnel, can we rely on that?\n The good side of entering to MPLS network is that we don't need to spend a great amount of equipment cost to deploy our separate network. Also we won't need to worry for failures and maintenance.\n In case we decide to involve to MPLS network, we need some commitments from operator on bandwidth reservation and max latency we are going to experience, right?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/AdventurousComputer0  \n [link]   [comments]",

FortiGate1's ports 2 and 4 are plugged into Nexus1's ports 1 and 2. The same is done for FortiGate2.\n When I added the second Nexus, I initially tried connecting port 2 from each FortiGate into the same Nexus, and port 4 from each FortiGate into the other. However, this caused unexpected behavior. I can't exactly recall what happened, as there were a number of issues I was troubleshooting during this time.\n Fast forward a few months, I noticed Po5 was down on Nexus1, and Po4 was down on Nexus2. I removed these port channels and quickly realized this caused an outage.\n I have an opportunity for a maintenance window this weekend and would like to improve this setup if possible. Would anyone who has implemented a similar topology be willing to expand on their HA configuration?\n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/FitButFluffy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Network is fairly simple with just a handful of VLAN’s, RSTP, DHCP reservations/assignments, and IGMP snooping. \n Now, onto the setup; switch (Cisco CBS-350 8 port switch in a touring enclosure) has just two VLANs active: VLAN 11 and VLAN 21, with VLAN 1 being the native VLAN as per Cisco standard. One PC on VLAN 11, and one device functioning as a ping responder on VLAN 21. \n The problem I’m having is the pc on VLAN 11 is able to ping the gateway for VLAN 21, as well as ping the device on VLAN 21 (though the ping only makes it TO the other device, it is not able to be sent back to VLAN 11). Problem only seems to arise when the PC is provided an IP with DCHP, when the PC is set to static IP in the same range I’m unable to ping the gateway of other VLANs. Feel free to ask any questions about the setup that I may not have answered, I’m sure I missed some things. TIA.\n    submitted by    /u/IShouldntGraduate  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Looking to replace a Netgear GS748Tv4H1 switch that's been in production since 2012. It has worked well (with the exception of a fan replacement a few years ago) but I recently deployed a new batch of workstations that have Intel i225/226 ethernet ports. For some unexplained reason, these computers will show \"Network disconnected\" unless I manually set the link speed to 10Mb. My troubleshooting process has narrowed it down to some issue with the Netgear switch. Anyway, management has approved a replacement switch, and I was rather hoping to find something that has at least some 2.5Gb ports as the PC's with the i225/226 ports all support that speed. Most of the cables have already been replaced with CAT6 already.\n No fancy networking scenarios here, just a single location of 40 or so mixed devices and the only requirement is LACP for the link aggregates on two Windows servers and a NAS. I will have to replace the WiFi setup as well so the 2.5Gb ports will come in handy for that and POE would be a plus but not a requirement. Having researched for the past few days I've come up with these:\n Juniper EX2300-48MP (16 x 2.5 GbE ports)\n EnGenius ECS2552FP (16 x 2.5 GbE port)\n FS S5800-48MBQ (48 x 2.5 GbE ports)\n People seem to have fairly positive things to say about the Juniper and I'm leaning that way (if I can find it in stock anywhere in Canada). However, I'm just wondering if I'm getting myself into a much more complicated situation that requires support contracts and subscriptions to cloud things and other enterprise-y stuff that I don't need. I abandoned Cisco years ago because the beancounters didn't want to pay for the yearly support contract and I couldn't get any firmware updates after that. I did have an account rep at CDW that I would go to for info but seems they're ghosting me. Am I fine just purchasing the hardware or should I really try to find a different VAR to make sure I'm getting everything I need?\n    submitted by    /u/Raquel427  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I feel like I already know the answer to this question. I was having a discussion about design with one of my bosses and I think we are in a disagreement about security best practices and practicality of implementing this type of design. \n I think its normal to have your data VLAN, voice VLAN, WiFi/Guest VLANs, IOT VLAN, server VLAN, and perhaps others as needed. I also think its normal for a lot, if not all, of this traffic to hairpin to the local firewall. This may add a very slight amount of latency, but its worth it because of the added security letting the firewall inspect, monitor, and log traffic. \n I think we have fundamental disagreements about network designs. I think hed prefer everything to be as flat as possible, but that is extremely messy. And makes troubleshooting difficult sometimes. As well as implementing changes on the fly. If data and phones are on the same subnet, you can run into QoS issues if you just start throwing on SSL inspection. \n Anyways, my point is this type of design should not be considered \"over-engineered\" for even a small to medium sized business. MAYBE a mom/pop shop with 10 employees, a DC, a file server, and a couple printers its overkill.

          "description": "Hi, sooo, yesterday I got burned really really badly on a Palo Alto pair that I'm migrating traffic across to. Long story short, it was a mistake my end, I had a NAT rule where I wanted it to NAT to the interface address of the outside interface and I had it built like this....\n Original Packet: Src Zone: Inside Dst Zone: Outside Dst Int: e1/1 Scr Address: entire 10/8 range Dst address: any\n Translated Packet: Src Translation: dynamic-ip-and-port Address-object for outside interface IP Dst address Translation: any\n The problem was, the address-object on the translated packet was what is on the outside interface, including the subnet mask of a /28!! Which royally messed everything up! I'm guessing that it was proxy-arping out for all the addresses in that range/subnet and it ended up killing our current live outbound firewalls!\n What I SHOULD have done is have another address-object that was the same address but on a /32, is that right? That's what I have now, but holy fuck am I scared to switch it back on! Even when going through a change!\n I noticed you can set it to translate to the interface address, interface and IP Address as well? Would this do the same as above when I mentioned about what I should've done instead?\n The PA NAT is definitely a different concept when coming from an ASA and Firepower world! And I lost a lot of confidence and have been pretty hard on myself ever since that happened yesterday and not seeing that!\n Would I be alright doing either of the 2 revised ways mentioned?\n The reason why I switched this particular NAT rule on was that its meant to be a catch all for PAT to the interface address, we have a large routed range that is natted to specific public IP's and they're currently live on the ASA's, so I can't enable those specific ones on the PA's yet, so I needed a way to get the outside interface working to test a few VM's in one of the lower end environments\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know it heavily depends on how many equipments are behind those, but… 🤷🏻‍♂️ - I’m starving for real life data ;-)\n And I know every network is different, but that would help me a lot if you could quote average and peak usages for those kind of networks you might have seen on 10G or even a 25G or 40G network (both North-South and East-West). \n I looked at research papers, but… I just couldn’t find anything useful.

I have been a staunch supporter of Arista in the datacenter but the 720 series just don't seem to make sense from a price to performance perspective (7 - 10k for a 24port POE switch...) . I really like Juniper's EX switches and the mist APs have been solid when I have deployed them in the past. However I am already deploying Fortinet / FortiAPs at other locations. I ideally wanted to avoid Cisco and have no experience with Aruba. I was thinking a mix of FortiGate FW \\ AP's and Juniper Switches (POE and Access) would probably work but would be curious to hear what other folks would opt for and why. Lets say for this exercise the site is 25k sqft over 4 floors with a comms room on each with structured caballing between comms rooms and to the floor ports. Cable runs for the AP's are already done. The Site will host about 100 - 150 users at peak. All you have to do is choose the hardware configure \\ install and manage it. Oh I suppose for external connectivity you could have dual DIA at the site with SD-WAN or P2P circuits to local DC locations if that makes any difference. \n ​\n  \nSwitches - Juniper EX (POE)\n Firewall - FortiGate 100 or 200f HA\n \nWireless (APs and Controller if required) - FAP-231G (FortiGate as the controller)\n  \n   submitted by    /u/apresskidougal  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n In our project we use PLC to control field devices with remote IO modules. This communication between PLC and remote IOs is handled by the PLC proprietary Ethernet protocol for SIL4 (safety integrity level).\n For troubleshooting reasons, we need to analyze the packets flowing between PLC and remote IOs so we set the port mirroring option in communication module of PLC. We can see other protocol packets with their respective IO IPs (i.e NTP) or ping packets. However, we can not capture the application data packets (UDP) with Wireshark. We tried port mirroring from both COM module and managed switch (to eliminate COM module mirroring feature bug) but no chance. Neither setup could capture data packets. Managed switch we used is Ruggedcom.\n Is there any restriction/limitation in port mirroring to not mirror the proprietary protocols or something? Are there anyone used this feature in industrial Ethernet environment?\n    submitted by    /u/AdventurousComputer0  \n [link]   [comments]",

I managed to get both VMs up and running, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to get connectivity between the two devices. \n One issue is that when I built a \"network\", and drag connections to the FTD/FMC, it does not provide me any options to declare \"which\" interface I want to connect to. If I could do that, it would not matter which network I built between them, it should work. I don't need internet access from the VMs, I just want them to talk to each other. \n Now, this is not that big of an issue on the FMC, as there only seems to be one interface connected, and I have put it on the same network as the FTDv. \n But I think the core issue is.. From the look of the interfaces, both devices are using loopbacks as the interface connected to switch in EVE-NG. I don't want to change the IPs on those interfaces, for fear that I lose the ability to console into the devices, which is currently working through the EVE-NG web console.\n ​\n On both FMCv and FTDv, both eth0 interfaces are configured for the desired management network. But the Transmit/Receive statistics on these interface show they are not connected in EVE-NG. So, given I don't seem to have the ability to specify which interfaces on the VM I want to use, how on earth do I connect the two eth0 interfaces in EVE-NG?\n    submitted by    /u/youmuzzreallyhateme  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently today we run on full Cisco Hardware - C8Ks, ISR 4Ks, and Cat 3850 and 9K Switches, with no other vendor hardware deployed at our branches. Within our Datacenter we have a pair of c8500s that aggerate our WAN Connections and run as DMVPN Hubs. We run a legacy design at all our branches with MPLS running as the Primary Transport and DMVPN as the Failover if we experience LEC or provider issues on the MPLS side. With this design, we route all traffic external to the branch to our main Hub no matter the destination… Internet or On-Prem infrastructure.

Cloud service providers (CSPs) face the same challenges and appear to use fundamentally similar technologies, except that they might be more \"agile\" in adopting new tech such as the latest flavor of SDN.

Ours (Fortinet) is coming to end of support.\n We own a small commercial building with a little more than 48 ports in the building. 15 or so go to our own company, and the rest of the building is for executive suites that we rent out to tenants. One tenant may be solo, and another may be 3-4 employees. So whatever product we use needs to be able to isolate the tenants to their own secure network. Beyond this, fairly intuitive interface, good security, and any other bells and whistles that may be beneficial to an executive suites building would be great.\n All that said, they are suggesting Sonicwall. I get the sense that this is just who they've been using for a long time. They speak highly of the product they put out... but I did a little reading on a few posts and found they don't have the best reputation compared to others. Maybe in those instances it was for larger clients with different needs... I don't know these devices are a little outside my expertise :)\n Our building is pretty high end and I'd like our networking capabilities we offer to tenants to reflect that as well.

(Currently only commented via legacy DC equipment at one Datacenter only) this task wasnt completed by our senior in 3 years they had to do it and now that person is gone so I'm up.\n My thought is to connect to each DC via EBGP where my MPLS nodes are AS1 and the DC environments are AS2-5 (vPC pairs with separate AS numbers. Idk If that's good design, I didn't set it up and I don't know DC/ACI. I'd almost think each vPC pair would share an AS but have separate AS per DC.)\n Regardless, I'd set route policies to only allow DC to DC traffic to traverse the DCI and any user traffic. From DCA site to DC2 site would traverse the MPLS backbone.\n What general approach would you all take to this?

Sadly I cannot add a route to the gateway statically or with something like bgp. \n If I assign the IPs to the router, it doesn't forward the packets because they are (from the routers perspective) at the destination.\n If I use KeepaliveD to fill the ARP Cache of the Gateway and then remove the address from the interface it works until the cache gets cleared. \n The Router runs VyOS (a Debian based Firewall / Router). \n Any Ideas and Tips are welcome :)\n    submitted by    /u/pfz4  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are also using the Cloud controller (Aruba Central, on v8.10.0.6_86193, tested with latest 8.10.x as well).\n We've configured a test SSID as we have begun deploying more 6e devices. We're seeing roughly half the throughput on the 6GHz as we see on the 5GHz radio with the same clients, running speed tests and iperf to local destinations (as well as Internet Speed Test reflecting the same). We see this throughput loss across 40MHz, 80MHz and 160MHz wide channels (it scales up as you'd expect with the increased widths, but we still see ~50% loss of throughput compared to 5GHz). …",

          "description": "I have an old slingbox that tries to reach out to the internet for connection to download configuration data several times a minute. This configuration data will brick the slingbox so it is not wanted. \n I see two solutions. One is to have a packet drop rule at the firewall to drop all these packets from the slingbox. I’ve tried this and it works but I hate the excessive logging. \n The second solution is to set a dummy gateway in the slingbox gateway field. Unfortunately the device would not let me set 127.0.0.1 and I had to pick a unused ip on the lan. This works great. Nothing is logged on the firewall and I can access the device from the lan as I don’t need internet access to it. \n So my question is from a network perspective. I’m assuming the dummy gateway on the slingbox to an ip not used on the lan will create additional arp request looking for it every time the slingbox tries to connect to internet for its bad config data via that dummy gateway.\n What would have the least network impact. The dummy gateway method or using the real firewall gateway and dropping all packets to internet?\n I’m assuming the dummy gateway method would free up any logging and load on the firewall but at the expense of broadcast additional arp request looking for the unused gateway ip. \n So what’s the better solution?\n    submitted by    /u/Proudx2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone. I've run into an interesting/potentially alarming discovery at the office and I wanted some opinions. I'm primarily a SysAdmin but I do have my CCNA so I'm not entirely useless with networking. Our previous NetAdmin left ~2 years ago and we've (I've) been slowly uncovering everything that's been done here as necessary. To say it's over-complicated is an understatement (~100 subnets for a company of then 40 people, not including the /30s for OSPF PTP).\n Background: Our ISP provides us a /30 as well as a /27 that we specifically requested. The /30 subnet is terminated (is that the proper term?) on the ISP's hardware: they provided us x.x.x.124/30, the gateway is x.x.x.125 on the ISP hardware and our IP is x.x.x.126. The /27 is terminated in our hardware connected to their hardware: with block y.y.y.160/27 our hardware has y.y.y.161 and acts as the gateway. x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 are on separate VLANs routable via a VRF.\n The question: is there any benefit to using VRF in this situation? Or is there any benefit to the subnet being terminated by our hardware rather than the ISP's hardware?\n Side note/question: These IPs and the VRF are configured on a switch, not a router and/or firewall. I've further discovered that both x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 provide console access to the switch PUBLICLY. I've since closed that via access lists, but are there any other security concerns regarding this situation?\n Flaired this as routing but it could qualify as security.

When connected to a Loadmaster and looking at the statistics, I am trying to understand what the Total Conns means. Is that just a connection for an individual service, port, user connection, etc? It is a total connection over 24 hours? The ask is because I do not know why some of my numbers are so high, when the system is a test system and not heavily utilized by more than a few people, however the total connections is over 2000.\n Seems Kemp questions are pretty vague here in this sub, but I am hoping for the best.

What if a host is physically connected (through the topology that might include some switches) to the router acting as Standby?

So I guess this post is for one of two things.... has anyone done anything similar to deal with one-off bugs that would be hard to identify in a lab environment before changes, and 2.... is there a solid Cisco API that I could parse against a keyword or software function (eg: BGP, SNMP, etc) and a list of device types/versions to try and proactively identify these types of issues? I'll be using Python, but language/nuances don't matter too much as I know not everyone here is super familiar with code.... more looking for if anyone knows manual methods or data sources/api's they've leveraged in the past that I can put code to in order to make a web front end that does these checks for us prior to changes.\n Thanks for any info!\n    submitted by    /u/syntax24  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then IIRC I'd set up permissions in their account on the server.\n I've been called upon to set up a VPN for someone, and it looks like things have changed remarkably. Whn I search in order to bone up, most returns are for commercial VPN companies who are focused on providing anonymity on the web.\n Has my method of creating simple VPNs become completely outdated? I assume that security issues and methods are very different nowadays.\n Are there any good resources out there to re-learn basic VPN principles and best practices? Perhaps as I've gotten older my search capabilities have dwindled, or else I'm so hopelessly out of the loop that I don't even know what to search for within the context of small office VPNs.

I understand there is a core exam (ENCOR) which needs to be passed before undertaking a concentration exam. I have very basic scripting knowledge but like idea of network automation and hoping to spark serious interest to this area.\n I may not know enough to properly make a decision on which specialty field to take for the concentration exam, but hypothetically speaking, if I were to choose the DevNet Professional for the concentration exam, would it make more sense for me to take the DEVASC exam rather than ENCOR?\n I would likely enjoy studying for the ENCOR exam since the topics appear very important to know and interesting but because I want to strengthen network programming, the DEVASC exam look nice as well.\n Btw I’m not in a rush to get CCNP certified, it’s something I would like to study slowly in addition to working full-time.\n Open to everyone’s opinion and advice!\n    submitted by    /u/tomatoget  \n [link]   [comments]",

I haven't been able to find any method to do either from a shell script, I tried looking at how people would do it on Cisco hardware and see EEM scripts mentioned, but I don't know how to adapt them to my situation.\n I am very new to configuring routing protocols on linux and writing scripts for such purposes, sorry if this sounds like a stupid question. Thanks a bunch!\n  \nEdit: Found the solution! I'm really stupid for not noticing this earlier, but you can use vtysh -c and chain commands, just like you would use sh -c to chain and send commands to the POSIX shell from a different shell.

We would see this usually when a specific firewall model was about to fail and starts acting buggy and shortly after totally dead (needing reboots and dropping connections the weeks leading up to failure sort of thing). Seen the exact scenario at least 3 times with this hardware.\n Anyhow when the FW would have it's issues devices on the LAN would also stop working bringing, basically the entire switch is affected for locally hosted programs that typically continue to work when internet is down otherwise. We replace the FW with a new model all is fine of course, but it's alwaysbleft me confused.\n My question though is how is the L3 firewall/gateway managing to screw up a dumb switch for L2 communication? I understand while it's having issues internet may not work but this phenomenon feels like it violates everything I learned about the OSI model?? \n I can only think something with ARP getting messed up or basically FW overloading the switch and basically DoS it? \n Simple flat layout.

Cinderblock walls that are concrete filled, so signal doesn't travel well between units. Looking for suggestions on best \"cheap used enterprise\" hardware to look at. Don't have much experience with Cisco, Aruba, Arista, etc. Read dozens of threads and can't tell whats legit and what's a Ford vs Chevy thing. Tried using 30 Google WiFi routers in topology described below and it failed horribly. Tenants are mom and pop so just needing basic wifi across the building plus extensive security system cause building is in the ghetto. \n Cat6 to each unit from roof, forming wired backbone of one hard-wired AP per unit into 2-3 48 port POE switches. Add more wireless APs in each unit to form a hybrid mesh network without have to run more Cat6 everywhere. Wired backbone would also contain dozens of POE security cameras. Wired backbone would have a few switches spread geographically aross the building (left, right, center) and all connected by SPF uplinks.\n I want to avoid licensing fees and recurring costs. Ideally I can buy cheap enterprise hardware on ebay/offerup, link it all up, write a script or two for configuration (or click some buttons on a web portal) and be done. If need to expand, buy more of the same used gear then plug and play to expand the network. Don't want to worry about getting bricked out because a vendor discontinues some cloud product or because my license expired or I didn't buy from approved vendors. Also confused on the internal vs external wireless controller -- seems like sometimes thay is part of the AP and other times it is seperate?\n What brands/models do you all recommend and why? Give me a shopping list that can get it done as cheap, easy and robust as possible.

Initially, a soft reset of the device had re-established serial as well as TCP communications.\n Within hours, all of the serial devices lost communications again. Several different configuration changes were tried to no affect. A TCP/RTU testing utility was unsuccessful in establishing communications to the slaves via the Converter (failed on handshake), but the Web UI for the converters was still accessible. Soft reset did not help this time.\n Ended up changing the statically assigned IP configured on the Converter to a different address, same port (502), on the same subnet. Comms started working, everything stabilized.\n It is still working but I don't understand why.\n    submitted by    /u/murphinate  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is replicated with the second pair in another rack and then the two pairs have a 4 line LACP bond to connect them. All of this is a standalone isolated network.\n My hope for this was a complete redundancy with zero downtime, as our use case is really sensitive to that and any network downtime can cause major headaches.\n Overall this solution seems to work reasonably well and survives reboot of up to 2 devices (one of each pair) at the same time. There however often are small network down times of 1-4 seconds when one device goes down or reconnects after getting back up.\n Is this normal? I've not been able to experience these technologies on one of the more expensive brand devices, so I can't compare, but I'd generally assume bonds are meant to mitigate perceivable network down times.\n    submitted by    /u/Anteros5  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey All, \n Long time lurker, first time posting. \n I've got a bit of a situation that I thought I had a solution to, but am now stumped. Please excuse any ignorance or lack of detail. \n The scenario is, we've got a location that just had a 3rd party install a Fortigate FW needed for remote access to their devices. Said firewall needs direct internet access. Normally this vendor would use an LTE device to accomplish this, but the location is out in the boonies and service sucks, so that option is out the window. \n Our current ISP has a Ciena fiber hand off with two 1 gbe ports (will come back to why this is relevant), one of which is being used to connect to our firewall for Internet access. The demarc for this fiber circuit is in a separate building from where the 3rd party Fortigate fw is located. The two buildings are connected via mm fiber and use Brocade/Ruckus switches. \n My initial thought was to run a link from the open port in the handoff, to our switch in an access port with a newly created vlan in building one, and trunk the vlan across the network to building two where the Fortigate is located (access port again) and assign the interface on the Fortigate one of the IP's from our block. Well, that was the plan until I just got off the phone with our ISP, where the indicated that that open port is actually for an entirely new circuit that we would have to add to our account. So, I'm back to the drawing board. \n As I eluded to early, we do have a block of IP's (/29) that we can use so I'm sure there's a solution, but I'm not sure how to achieve that. While I was only the phone with the ISP, they also indicated that in order to use that block, I'd have to have a L3 device to handle the routing of said block. I don't think leadership will agree to purchasing any equipment for this as things have been extremely tight. \n Apologies if this is all over the place, it's been a hell of a day, and not just for the problem above. \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/Iamjim1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys. My company will be having a new ISP line installed at a new site and I was shown what the IP details were by my colleague. I'm quite confused! This is my first time being involved in this sort of stuff so I'm trying to understand as much as I can.\n In our other offices we have ISP circuits where we have been given a /29 IP range and we just assign the IP of our firewalls from this range and point the default gateway to that of the ISP router so it is a lot simpler.\n Now it's LAN IPs and WAN IPs and I've no idea how they relate to our current setup which is:\n Firewall (DHCP,NAT) > L2 switch > ISP router\n I know we need a router that will point all traffic to the ISP default gateway, that much is clear. There is a /29 range for the LAN side and a /30 for the WAN side.\n The way I see it is that we have to use 2 IPs from the /29 for the firewalls and another IP for the router interface facing the firewall. Then from the /30 range another router interface (pointing to the ISP router) will be configured with an IP and then a default route will point to the ISP's default gateway.\n I think that our setup will then be:\n Firewall (DHCP,NAT) > L2 switch (ISP failover) > Router > ISP router\n Am I on the right track with this or am I completely misunderstanding?\n    submitted by    /u/hweb47  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've dug around for examples configuring this on a Nexus 9K and I've pieced a few things together, but I haven't been able to get a BGP session up. I appreciate any insight you might share.\n On my side I have 1G service delivered from Zayo into an eth port on a Nexus C93180YC-FX running NXOS 9.3(10). Zayo indicated that I should use QinQ and they're delivering the primary on VLAN A, secondary on VLAN B.\n My QinQ-fu isn't strong but at a high level my understanding is that I should be receiving S-tags A and B and using C-tag C, which is what I've configured for VLAN ID in Azure. Do I have that backwards? Microsoft's routing examples, though for IOS-XE, seem to indicate the reverse.\n I am consulting this article for configuring QinQ on the 9K.\n My issue is that all of the documentation I'm reading is around multiple inner tags with one outer tag. I believe I need the reverse. I've tried both the Configuring VLAN Mapping for Selective Q-in-Q on a 802.1Q Tunnel Port and Configuring Selective Q-in-Q with Multiple provider VLANs examples. I enter the first VLAN mapping switchport vlan mapping vlan-id-range dot1q-tunnel outer vlan-id and when I try to enter a second mapping with the same inner VLAN ID I receive an error about a conflicting mapping for the inner VLAN already existing on this port.\n Other info:\n I tried a configuration with just the primary to see if I could get BGP peering but nothing is coming up.\n interface EthernetXYZ description erc switchport mode dot1q-tunnel switchport vlan mapping C dot1q-tunnel A spanning-tree bpdufilter enable ! interface VlanC description erc no shutdown ip address 10.10.3.1/30 ! ! router bgp PRIVATEAS log-neighbor-changes neighbor 10.10.3.2 remote-as 12076 ` \n    submitted by    /u/Selcouthit  \n [link]   [comments]",
