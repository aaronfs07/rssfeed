CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assess that the FCEB network was compromised by Iranian government-sponsored APT actors.\nCISA and FBI are releasing this Cyb…",

I can see in the AuthnRequest that the Issuer is in URI.\n Now, we've been trying to put AWS Cognito or Auth0 between the web app and the IdP.\n The problem is, the IdP that we're using requires the Entity ID to be URI.\n In AWS Cognito/Auth0, Entity ID is in URN format. \n I wonder if Cognito/Auth0 is not supported by the IdP. Also, what's the difference between IdP's that require URI and URN for the Entity ID?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/BreakfastCupNoodles  \n [link]   [comments]",

We also use Dell Latitude laptops. Initially everything was working great except the cracks began to show quickly. \n Because the second monitor is daisy chained Windows doesn’t know about it immediately when returning from sleep or hibernate. This means that any windows that were open before sleeping will all move back to the primary monitor. \n Intermittently when docking, one of the monitors will be blurry. Changing resolution to anything else then changing back to 1080p fixes it. \n Worst of all, randomly when returning from sleep and logging in, the whole laptop will reboot. We’ve been unable to figure this out and Dell are stumped too. \n All up this has been a major reputation hit and we’re now having to go back to buying docks and having to mess around with re-cabling all these desks.

We use it for reporting, Windows client updates (monthly), some application installs, and other various means. \n Recently, our Systems Architect has decided the help desk needs to manage Windows updates for the clients, his reasoning? They are workstations, the server team is not responsible for them. Ok, from a high level perspective, I agree. However, the system used to manage those updates is our responsibility. \n He is really pushing this on the help desk, so I've decided him and I need to have a meeting about this. \n I find several issues with this line he is trying to draw:\n •The help desk does not currently manage nor know how to use SCCM (I understand this does not mean it isn't their responsibility)\n •The sysadmin team has been managing SCCM for 5 years (this doesn't mean it's our responsibility)\n •None of our roles define SCCM as a responsibility\n Typically, a Desktop Engineer role would buffer this, but we don't have that role.\n So who is responsible? Managing clients is a gray area, some responsibility falls on us, some on the help desk. This all started when I pulled the data on our ~800+ clients running 1909, critically out of date. He said the help desk should have known and been on top of it, and here we are. \n I have found little to no help desk roles in the industry where SCCM is a requirement, quite the opposite for sysadmin roles. \n I look forward to and appreciate all your input.\n Edit: Lots of good points about this being an opportunity for the HD folks to grow.

I also have a few certs, Net+ and AWS CCP. \n So I can’t say that I haven’t learned anything- I have learned a LOT.

Instead of just reading a book or watching a video, I actually break them down and document what I am learning in Notion. But I feel like the things that I am learning aren’t sticking like they do for some of the other senior guys on forums like this.\n How do you guys go about learning and actually retaining the information you learn? I’ve even had the thought that what I am doing now is right, because I am learning how to learn, aka getting better at learning new technologies, which I think is a foundational skill in IT.\n TLDR; How do you learn and retain knowledge specific to IT?\n    submitted by    /u/PointlessPoptart  \n [link]   [comments]",

My site of around 300 machines are all running 21H2 so from my understanding i can upgrade via the enablement package. 21H2 have support until the middle of next year so no immediate rush.\n I want to push this out to a few machines to test, i use WSUS and client side targetting so applying this to individual machines can be a pain as i would have to setup a new GPO to target a new client side group.\n I was wondering if its possible to get hold of the files and push it out via PDQ instead? I notice it says they are not available from the Windows Update catalogue though.\n Has anyone else used the enablement package outside of WSUS some how and managed to upgrade machines?\n Appreciate any advice\n    submitted by    /u/JuryAdventurous1097  \n [link]   [comments]",

Back then, I thought I completely removed the thing, since it was coming from an old XP machine, made it's way to the DC and didn't really do anything else, since it was so effing old. I used ZenMap, to, supposedly, find all remains and remove them, but now I've gotten a notice, that the disk-space for C:\\ is getting low. I checked to find Sophos Endpoint Agent creating snapshot files by the hour, because it kept finding and deleting the same file in Sys32, that is being generated by some mysterious Conficker Virus remains. \n I checked online, but didn't get any real results, just some general tips, on how to remove Conficker. Now, I'm not really experienced, when it comes to malware and viruses, so I don't know, where to start, that's why I'm turning to your expertise again. If you need more info, please go ahead and ask, and I'll provide any necessary info.\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/xdernomad  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately due to various reasons I reached that \"burn-out\" point where I was underpaid and overwhelmed with the work being requested of me, so I found a new position earlier this year, working in media.\n A few months in, the transition between the two environments has been, well.. extreme.\n Pros: Finally getting paid what I'm worth, in an industry more to my liking, with less responsibility!\n Cons: Mostly Windows environment (few hundred servers, mostly bare-metal), no documentation aside from a handful of spreadsheets, inconsistent communication within the department, no one's even heard of a code repository before, management is very resistant to change. \n I'm someone who's done all the DevOps things and enjoys doing them when the workloads are reasonable. This is the path I want to grow in as (from what I can tell) the world is moving more towards microservice/IaaS models. \n Am I in the right for wanting to gracefully push the place more towards modern standards? or should I just accept that this is the culture in the new industry and maybe this position isn't a good fit after all?\n    submitted by    /u/roguesaxophonist  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "All this talk about how the November CU update was breaking domain authentication in environments where RC4 was explicitly disabled via group policy sent me down a rabbit hole.\n My environment wasn't affected, but it made me curious about WHY so many have disabled RC4. TLDR; it's less secure than AES256.\n Step 1) audit your domain controllers for RC4 in use. Just replace DC01 with the name of your domain controller. 0x17 events means RC4 is being used.\n Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Security' -ComputerName 'DC01' -FilterXPath \"*[System[EventID=4769] and EventData[Data[@Name='TicketEncryptionType']='0x17']]\" \n What this uncovered is that Azure AD Connect for hybrid environments was using RC4 (it creates a computer object called AZUREADASSOACC). I guess the reason for this was that until sometime in 2020 AES wasn't supported?? So if you use Azure AD Connect, you might want to look into this to improve security.\n Anyway, this article nicely outlines the steps needed to get Azure AD Connect using AES https://azuregeek.io/en/secure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac/?q=%2Fen%2Fsecure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac%2F\n After following these steps & rolling over my Kerberos decryption keys I now see Azure AD SSO now using AES (0x12 in the event log)\n    submitted by    /u/MediumFIRE  \n [link]   [comments]",

We quickly found out that was not what should have been done and they should have had the command, Enable-MailUser run on them as they are external contractors and we simply want to have them as AD Users that have an external email address that mail is resolved to.\n Okay, simple enough I thought. So, I went ahead and ran the following for each user that was affected:\n Disable-RemoteMailbox -Identity <users> -Confirm:$false\n Enable-MailUser -Identity <user> -ExternalEmailAddress <[user@theircompany.com](mailto:user@theircompany.com)>\n We also wanted their Email field in the General tab of AD to match their UPN, so after running the above commands, AND before AAD sync happened (unfortunately) we updated their Email field to match that of their UPN. When we run the Enable-MailUser is makes their Email property their external email address. Well, that appears to have messed up those users where now On-prem they are showing as MailUsers, but in 365 they are showing still as a UserMailbox for RecipientType.\n We are struggling to get this update on both ends. So far, I have tried taking one of the users and running Disable-MailUser, letting that sync over to 365 and then running Enable-MailUser again. No luck. I have tried having the user set up as a MailUser On-prem and then stop syncing them with 365. Once they are no longer synced, I then re-sync them, but again, no luck.\n What's even stranger is we noticed that when we disable them On-prem as a MailUser, and then re-sync them, one property keeps getting written back it would seem from 365 to On-prem...\n Within the user's proxyAddresses, one address shows up. The x500? I'm wondering if I am missing a step here or if something else needs to be updated for these users to finally sync up as a MailUser On-prem as well as in 365?

Right now the external records (e.g. www.company.com) are just placed inside the default \"company.com\" zone inside the AD DNS.\n Is there currently any Best Practise way to keep external records automatically up2date inside the AD zone?\n There might be some way to automate this with powershell (lookup external records and set internal records accordingly) but this feels a bit too hacky.\n Best case would be to tell AD to lookup the records on the external DNS if the internal DNS does not have any records. As far as I understand by default AD doesn't forward those requests since only the internal DNS is authoritative for \"company.com\"?\n It's probably not as simple as adding the external name server to \"Properties -> Nameserver\" on the AD I guess?\n Is there any way around this problem or do you just have to live with manually maintaining those external records on the internal DNS?\n I've also seen you can do zone transfers from AD to a specific server. Could you instead do a zone transfer from external to internal? (Without it overwriting all the internal records)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/cmrb_at  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please share what you found to be the best informational pieces to help pass the exam! I am trying to get my foot in the door and am not sure what would be the best course to start with on this journey that continues to align with what is needed for A+.

I didn’t want to hurt the guys feelings so I told him I need to be remote to be able to support my family more which is true but mainly I was sick of the constant lack of support while being handed project after project while trying to be an entire IT department for a large organization. \n I kid you not I got the 5 stages of grief from him.\n In no particular order:\n Denial- what do you mean? Your not putting in your 2 weeks notice are you?\n Anger- There is no way I am going to be able to replace you by the deadline! Who gave you an offer? How much?\n Bargaining- Would you stay if gave you 5 grand? Can you please stay until march, I’ll let you work from home! We can work with you. Please let me work with you!\n Depression- I thought we were friends. I can take care of you. Give me a chance please! \n Acceptance- you’ll want to hand in a formal notice of resignation if this is what you really want. \n I didn’t want to tell him I accept an offer anywhere else but he kept patronizing me by telling me that money is gonna be tight and shit so i finally told him I got an offer somewhere else that gives me more freedom. He kept fucking grilling me to give him a chance to do good by me but it just felt weird. I told him I’d sleep on it cause I felt bad but I told him not to expect me to change my mind. Now he’s fucking texting me outside of work saying he spoke with the ceo so they can “make it work” for me to work remotely most of the time.\n TLDR; Gave 2 weeks notice and tried to be nice by focusing on a personal priority of mine instead of telling my boss what i really think and it back fired. \n I’m handing in a formal resignation tomorrow hopefully it’s all just acceptance from there out.\n    submitted by    /u/red_plate  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Is there even a big software company that provides even middling support these days?\n This weekend was a final migration from on-prem file server to Box. Users had been warned for weeks that this was coming, that the Box app had already been pushed to their computer, and that they needed to sign in to see how it worked so they would understand how everything worked and how to access shared files once the server is down.\n Of course most users ignored this and so, expecting exactly that, I was on site first thing today to get them going.\n Unfortunately things went sideways and most people who hadn't already signed in were unable to. The company uses Google Workspace so Box had been added as a SSO app through SAML, but signing in with their Google credentials either produced a prompt to create a password (???) or an error saying \"invalid credentials\".\n I immediately created a ticket with tons of detail and SAML traces, got a pretty quick reply from a T1 tech who said that the accounts I referenced didn't have passwords and could I please have the users create them. After a bit of back and forth about what \"SSO\" stands for he escalated the ticket.\n Hours passed. Frantic web searches yielded nothing. I looked through the SAML traces myself and couldn't find anything (I know nothing about web dev but figured I'd try). I called the Box account manager, who also \"escalated\". Updated the ticket email with more details. Called the account manager again. Had the customer's CFO call the account manager with me on the line.\n 5 hours later I got a reply from someone claiming to be a T2 tech, asking for a SAML trace from an affected user.\n    submitted by    /u/aeolist  \n [link]   [comments]",

A year or two ago or so, one of the UniFi \"controller\" upgrades put a bunch of our older, perfectly-functioning AP's out of management scope. They still run but we can't change any SSID settings or even see how many clients are connected because the hardware is EOL. I could understand a nag screen or something, but to actually take functionality away from perfectly functional hardware? Come on now.\n So we bite the bullet and pick up some new U6-LR AP's. Oh fantastic, now they are pulling 16+ watts each and overpowering the PoE switches, leading to constant reboots of the APs. Cool - it's one of the bugs that is fixed in the new UniFi \"Network Application\", let's upgrade that again.\n Nope! That requires installing Java 11, which seems to be either unobtainable or undetectable, because I've installed at least 3 different versions of JDK, OpenJDK, some weird third-party extraction of JRE 11, and some other garbage, just for the UniFi installer to tell me it still needs Java 11 and quit the installer. Why does the latest Unifi software not use the latest Java? We're on version 19 now for God's sake.\n So now I can't access old hardware, can't use new hardware, can't upgrade the software, and if I'm able to install it I'm sure I will run into some other new stupidity, plus have to hack my way into making it a service again because it's only a console application for some ridiculous reason.\n /rant\n    submitted by    /u/AmazedSpoke  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am on the Linux side and trying to create a gold image as we don't want to use the Market Place images, due to costs and mnagement. We have about a half dozen subscriptions for Azure and each one has many resource groups. \n ​\n In tests it looks like the market place image is easy to deploy, though it isn't what we want. Looks like custom images are tied directly into the resource group and I think, if I undrestand it correctly, we need to have a gallery to be able to use an image within the other resource groups in the same subscription, though need a seperate gallery for each subscription? It feels like there are a lot of different settings when it comes to creating an image and Azure is very picky, yet very unforgiving about things. Simple things like changing names of the image can't be done, you have to create a new image w/ the name you want.\n ​\n Due to inforced RBAC, we can only create and delete VMs, we can't create Images, which is an internal problem that we have. So it doesn't help that we have a seperate team working on it, though we are trying to have that role added to our group. The other team, which is part of the Windows Team uses Market Place Image for their stuff, so they don't have much experience with creating gold images.\n ​\n Also the latency between the cloud and our on prem enviornment seems to introduce a lot of other issues, we have to up timeouts in tools that we have no issue communicating across the country to our sister DC, though communicating between our DC and Azure in the same side of the country has time out issues.\n    submitted by    /u/DogNamedCharlie  \n [link]   [comments]",

After some misshaps in my personal life, i've had difficulties finding a job as a developper. I then decided to apply for helpdesk positions at multiple local companies and landed myself a job at the local university.The job was advertised as a \"helpdesk\" position.\n I've been working there for the past 1.5 years. The transition with the person before me was a little rocky at first since i had so much to learn in so little time (AD / GPOs / Imaging / Networking ...) and i'm still learning new stuff everyday.\n I manage around 150-200 Windows 10 machines. The department uses a variety of CAD softwares ( CATIA / Inspire / MoldFlow / MSC Patran_Nastran / Vericut ...) but they mostly use SolidWorks.\n The person before used to create a windows image every year with the latest version of the softwares they use. This created a problem where the images he created were at the very least 75gb. I've been able to move away from this by automating most of the installs with scripts.\n Now that i think i have the basics down, i'd like to optimize the process and find ways to deal with SolidWorks configs in a multi-user environment.\n    submitted by    /u/Delicious-Stay-8550  \n [link]   [comments]",

I do it all the time with old servers, what about storage?\n Oh - and this will all be 100% offline too - I've kept the old FC switches and a couple of old ESX hosts to build an unsupported play area.\n Any thoughts/comments/traps greatly appreciated.\n Cheers,\n    submitted by    /u/hkeycurrentuser  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also noticed a fan was down in the logs in the idrac. \n Okay, put in a service ticket as it's under warranty. Go home and think nothing of it. \n 2nd shift tech shoots me a message in the middle of the night that he noticed something revving up in our DC but couldn't pinpoint it - then goes home. While everyone is sleeping the idrac shuts the NAS down on it's own overnight. I come in next day, can't remote into it so I find out it is offline, then plug in a crash cart. All the volumes showing as foreign and the config is gone.\n OK - little worried. Check the idrac and see all the volumes disconnected from the raid controller. Bump up the escalation on the service ticket and engineer comes out within a few hours. \n We replace 1x drive, 2x fans. Bright orange dell fans were now black and a little melty. Forced to acknowledge all the volumes as foreign and reload the config. Thankfully everything boots as it should and that knot in my stomach releases a bit.\n Apparently if you lose 2 of 5 fans, the unit shuts itself down to protect from heat damage.

My original idea was to just drag all the emails from their Google Workspace into a local pst file on Outlook desktop app then after changing over to M365 to copy them back across. More labour intensive but safer?\n Also if I do the migration for a 15GB mailbox I expect that to take several hours and theres a good chance emails will be received during that time so what happens to them?\n Have I missed anything out?\n One thing that does concern me is that at the top of that page it says \"Effective from December 2022, the classic Exchange Admin Center will be deprecated for worldwide customers. Microsoft recommends using the new Exchange Admin Center, if not already doing so. \"\n The further down in step 5 it says \"IMAP migration is not available for new EAC. \" \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/wagglyears  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This post is directly copied from r/ITManagers (albeit with some added bits). I was advised to post this on this subreddit\n So our DHCP pool is full pretty often. A lot of users are using laptops. When they connect their laptop to a cable, their WiFi is still connected. Because of this, a lot of users are using two IP addresses while only one is needed.\n I found some solutions. A Powershell script and a GPO policy that makes it so that an established LAN connection will disable the WiFi connection. However, I don't think this cancels the IP Lease that the WiFi connection has. Is there a way to make the WiFi disable AND the leased WiFi IP to be released again?\n The GPO solution would be the best, as we wouldn't have to do this on every pc individually. I found the following policy: Computer Configuration -> Policies ->Administrative Templates -> Network ->Windows Connection Manager > Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows\". I am not sure if this also releases the IP-lease of the WiFi connection from the DHCP pool. If not, this wouldn't work as a solution as well.\n I like to add that I am just a helpdesk support Employee. I am guessing a lot of people will say that we shouldn't have LAN and DHCP in the same IP Range. Though you are probably right, I am Sadly not in a position to change this.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/WimVaughdan  \n [link]   [comments]",

On one side I would be happy to have an income to cover my expenses a little. On the other side I dont know if it would limit me too much in my plans.\n I cannot be sure to be always available (internet connection in rural areas all over the world?) and the time differences would also cause problem. Of course, I also want to do and see as much as possible during my trip. To work would also mean a daily loss of time. \n It is not about the money. I don't necessarily have to work to be able to afford the trip. However, it would be helpful.\n I could imagine working a few hours a day as 1st Level remote support. But I'm not even sure if I should. \n Do you think it makes sense to look for a job in IT at all, or are other fields of work better suited. For example, as a sales agent. However, I have no experience in this or other sectors. \n Background:\n Working in IT for more then 10 years.

The salary is good, and you know the usual 9-5 job, I decided to give my notice to my current employer to join this company.\n Mid my notice period, a startup company that is funded and supported has offered me a position, the salary is the same as the one I received from company I'm moving into, although the base salary itself is higher by around $500/month, since they don't have the same benefits as that company, they decided to pump my base salary in order to match the offer that I received from the big company.\n Overall, both companies offered me the same salary, although the big company got more now such as bonuses, among other benefits.\n The startup does not have any benefits beside the monthly salary as they are pretty new right now, I asked them about bonuses, and they said its planned but not yet confirmed as they've just started. They also do not provide equity, and they could not provide me with an answer if they plan on giving equity or not.\n I'm honestly pretty confused right now on what to pick, I was gonna pick the startup as I bet it would be more relaxed (in terms of environment not work), but if i'm taking a high risk, what's the high reward exactly if there is no equity provided ?\n Sorry for my bad English, please let me know your thoughts about this :(\n    submitted by    /u/Live_Ad_74  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yesterday it all went to shit (always happens when its a WFH day) and I have users bitching that Teams images are not loading, that attachments in Outlook Web are not loading, and that websites need to be refreshed just to get them to load (That last one got told to me this morning... and thats when I threw my fists up in the air and screamed \"F U DNS!!!\"\n Changed the DHCP settings, threw ipconfig /release and /renew at a couple of clients to test and you bet your android bottom it worked! \n I am going to now abuse my internet freedom and watch YouTube videos while I cry into my coffee. \n By the way... if you have not tried Fortigate then you really should!\n    submitted by    /u/SouthAfricanGiant  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are a small business with <10 employees and deal primarily with cad files, excel files, and just pdfs. Currently, we store everything on hard drives( yes, very old fashioned) and this is not working out. Overall, we have around 1tb of data, with the largest files being around 1gb. I would like to be able to store this information in one central place, yet grant different people access to certain folders. Sharing and collaborating on documents isn’t a huge focus, yet would be nice to have. We mostly just need a good storage solution that we can access from any computer. A lot of the things we work with are proprietary so security is important to us. What do you all recommend?

          "description": "Hey everyone. I was looking for some opinions here. I searched for other posts similar to my situation, but I wanted to get some advice since many posts were a few years old.\n We could have better backup storage at my company. Currently, we have two sets of external drives attached to our backup system onsite, sitting in the same room on top of each other. Each set of drives hosts an independent copy of all of our backups. We are also copying a set of these backups into Azure.\n I was permitted to look into upgrading these off-brand external drive enclosures into a rack-mounted solution for Site A and then putting an offsite backup into Site B. I got a quote for a Synology system, but the fact that they're forcing you to use their branded drives doesn't sit well with us. Additionally, it would be about $10-12k for one of these systems - which was more than they wanted to spend on two systems.\n As I was thinking of alternatives, I remembered we have two SuperMicro servers (that we used to use as Hyper-V servers) that aren't being used, each having 16x drive bays in them. Both have 256GB of RAM and plenty of processing power, even though they're ~8 years old. I was thinking of loading TrueNAS Core onto these servers, loading up the bays with storage, using these as our physical backups at sites A and B, and then still copying a set into Azure. I have never used TrueNAS before, but I think it would accomplish what we need. I can also get some 18TB Iron Wolf Pro drives for $300/ea - so ultimately, the cost of this buildout would be the cost of the drives.\n Would you have any thoughts on this setup? Pros/cons? Alternatives I should look at? Our total footprint is 50TB, but we're currently not doing Client Backups or O365 Backups, so that will be my next project - so I need room to expand.\n I appreciate any opinions.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/MurrghFromIT  \n [link]   [comments]",

Trying to find a number on how long a device can go without having line of sight to the internal network/DC. \n With 140ish users we have one, maybe two devices that will spend more than a day at a time away from the office (up to a month I’m told is the max) so we would like to avoid the complexities of configuring Intune and having different management protocols for these two devices but want to make sure how long they can go without checking in. They will still have internet connectivity so they are able to check in with Azure but not the internal network in our current plan. \n Any advice is appreciated, I can’t find anything about this online and want to make sure we have everything in order before we get too deep in this project.\n Edit for clarification: right this moment these users are using local users and manually copying/emailing any files that need saved in company file shares, etc. We are working to make sure all devices are managed and users and company data are both controlled while having access to company resources when on the road.\n    submitted by    /u/ytown91  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are having plenty of difficulties patching third party applications and don't have the man power to keep packaging apps.\n While we looked and trialed PatchMyPC and worked really well, a subsidiary of ours isn't using MECM and has all their devices enrolled into Intune/Endpoint Manager. This was fine, until we went to enroll the terminal servers, which at that point realised Microsoft doesn't support Endpoint Manager for MS Server.\n So now we are looking at RMM tools to help us with, application deployment and patching. I have come across a number of tools, and NinjaOne seems to be on top. But their pre-sales are frustrating and constantly want me to do a demo session with their techs instead of just giving me a price on the 2500 devices I want to cover.\n I checked out Gartner, but it doesn't do quadrants for this in particular, more so unified desktop management which brings MS Endpoint Manager to the top.\n If anyone could chime in on if you had a blank slate, what would you do?

On the day to day pc replacement, we just use the dell default image, go through the oobe and install everything by hand in-person, then manage the rest with our RMM. For a re-image, we just use the media creation tool image and once again go through the oobe, join domain, install software. \n For large scale replacements, (When win7 went EOL) we had a process where we would upgrade the PC to win10, and then use Macrium reflect to clone the PC onto a brand new PC. This was relatively quick and effective at the time, however over the last 2 years we have had constant issues with a lot of the cloned machines and ended up re-imaging most one by one. \n I have been asking management to start doing the Dell Image Assist, where we get them from dell mostly pre-imaged, but they decline every time. \n Well, now, one of our larger clients just had 150 new Pc's delivered, that they need installed, and the ticket has been just dropped onto me to get it done. This would require me to unbox, complete the oobe, rename the PC, join it to the domain, install chrome, adobe reader, office 365, and their specialized software. And then on a per user basis install their respective printers, scanners, other devices. \n Anyone have any ideas on the fastest way to get these PC's deployed? Sysprep drive duplicating?

One thing they found was a high number of users that had adminCount set to 1. Their recommendation was to clear the adminCount for all standard users and see how many of them return to an adminCount of 1 the next time SDPROP runs and review the list at that time.\n I inadvertently cleared the adminCount for ALL AD objects instead of just the standard user objects. In other words, the builtin groups that are supposed to be protected were also cleared. When I realized this, I set the adminCount for those groups and 2 users (administrator and krbtgt) to adminCount=1.\n Admittedly, my understanding of how SDPROP works could be way off but my expectation would be that when SDPROP runs, any users of those protected groups should have thier adminCount set to 1, inheritance disabled and their ACL replaced with the same permissions as what are on the AdminSDHolder object.\n However nothing is getting the adminCount set back to 1, not even domain admin group members. I don't know how to check to make sure that SDPROP is running or not. I checked the PDC for the registry entry that controls the SDPROP frequency (HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\NTDS\\Parameters\\AdminSDProtectFrequency) and it doesn't exist so it should be running every hour by default.

          "description": "Hello !\n ​\n First of all, sorry if i make gramatical/technical mistakes, English is not my first language.\n So, recently, my company started to use Azure AD for using Office 365 with a federated Domain. We set a SSO with Shibboleth linked to our main domain. Then, if a user try to connect to the domain, it redirect them on the CAS page, and if they're already connected, allow the authentication. This was done with our network engineers, actually in charge of the OpenLDAP (one of the domain is on Samba 4 and the other only have and LDAP and no samba)\n ​\n Since then, we though of some amelioration and I was trying to log in windows with work account (so an account present in the azure A.D). It works for the account in managed domain, but doesn't for the federated domain.\n ​\n I know it's logical since the Windows authentication can't redirect them to our CAS, but I read online that some people can login with federated domain username and password. My question is, how ?\n ​\n I believe the main mistake was during the first implementation of the SSO with the command Set-MsolDomainAuthentication. We used the command as :\n Set-MsolDomainAuthentication -DomainName $OurDomain -federationBrandName $FederationBrandName -LogOffUri $LogoutUrl -Authentication Federated -PassiveLogOnUri $LogonURI -SigningCertificate $certData -IssuerUri $uuri -PreferredAuthenticationProtocol SAMLP \n We didn't use \"ActiveLogonUri\", but I'm not sure if this is usefull, nor really sure about what that property can do. Still, this command work for the web-based applications but obviously not for Windows authentication \n Is this the problem or am I completly out of place ?

So only things sent from M365 will allow outbound mail. \n DKIM is setup via DNS and our 365 admin centre. And this seems fine. \n But here’s where I’m a bit confused. We have dmarc enabled and it was set to quarantine. So all mail that fails SPF and DKIM will go into spam? Is this for inbound or outbound mail? I thought DMARC was for outbound, but a 3rd party trying to email us, got an error showing DNS Auth: DMARC failed.\n Is this an issue on our end?\n Tia\n    submitted by    /u/Haroldjbb  \n [link]   [comments]",

The official documentation is clear on this: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#security-nonces.\n I have reported to the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), and they confirm the incorrect implementation but do not consider it a security problem. \"We will, therefore, not process your report further,\" said an anonymous employee.

          "description": "About two years ago I started at a small/medium business with a few hundred employees. We were almost all on prem, very few cloud services outside of MS365. The company previously had one guy who was essentially \"good with computers\" set things up but they grew to the size where they needed an IT guy full time, which isn't super unusual.\n But the owner was incredibly cheap. When I started they had a few working virtual host servers but they had zero backups - absolutely nothing on prem was being backed up externally. In my first month there I went to the owner and explained how bad things would be if we didn't have any off site backups we were doomed. I looked into free cloud alternatives but there wasn't anything that would fit our needs.\n Management was very clear - the budget for backups is $0, and \"nothing is going to happen, you worry too much\"\n So I decided to do it myself. I figured out how much I could set aside each week and started saving. I didn't make a whole lot but I did have extra money each month. I was determined to have a disaster recovery plan, even if they didn't want to pay for it.\n And some of you may remember, Hurricane Ian hit a few months ago. We were not originally predicted to take the brunt of it, and management wanted no downtime, so we did not physically remove the server from the premises. The storm damaged the building and we experienced some pretty severe data loss. \n So it was time for my disaster recovery plan. The day after, we gathered at the building and discovered the damage. After confirming we had lost data, I said \"I quit,\" I got in my car, and lived off the 6 months of savings I had. Tomorrow I start my new job.

Essentially, it will be on a website with two options, the main one being to print a label that a user has been emailed. Clicking that button opens the camera and scans a QR code, once code has been read it will prompt the user to click a print label button where i'd like it to silently print said label to an attached label printer. The site is all working and tested fine.\n So i've created an intune profile for the browser, using Microsoft Kiosk Browser app rather than Edge so that it displays fullscreen with no navigation bars etc. There is an additional configuration profile setup to Force Allow the browser access to the camera. The first part works fine, However the print page takes me to an error page (the page works in normal edge so i know it works) the error shows:\n sorry that file type is unsupported blob:[mywebsiteaddress] \n So i'm assuming that the Kiosk Browser app doesn't support printing?.\n If i then change the browser in the configuration profile to MS Edge, printing will work fine, however, its not a full screen browser window and has navigation options, I still get the prompts to allow the camera, and I also get a print dialog screen which i really don't want. \n My questions are:\n  \nCan someone pin point where that first error might come from with regards to printing in the Kiosk Browser app\n If not, is there a way or an option that im missing to force edge into full screen mode and allow the camera access and disable the print screen.\n  \nThe Kiosk Browser is the prefered option.\n    submitted by    /u/slothmeister  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it just their privacy policy? \n Or is it just the fact that the benefits of using a password manager at all greatly outweighs the risks of password manager company \"turning to the dark side\"?\n By using a password manager, you are in fact completely trusting your digital identity and privacy to them. If I were any government's agency, I'd sponsor my own password manager so that all people are willingly handing their identities over to me and I wouldn't even need to move a finger...\n Personally, I'm using KeePass which is open source so that much wider community is able to review it's code for possible weaknesses and, more importantly, backdoors. I'm also using a composite master key to unlock the database. One part is stored locally on my devices while the other part is a password that I regularly type. This way I can keep my password reasonably short for greater convenience and still practically impossible to brute-force by anyone that could possible get hold of my database.

I have to follow up dozens of times to get techs out after repeated no-shows.\n We’re a Lenovo shop and that means most hardware support is done by IBM, (some part of the Byzantine IBM/Lenovo deal back in the day I’m sure). I’m not sure if this is just usual pain from IBM circling the drain or if other people are noticing this with different vendors as well? Lenovo is great at shipping out the parts but getting the tech on site is simply not happening anymore which really reduces the value of the warranty imo.\n What are your experiences with getting vendor hardware support?

          "description": "Good Afternoon Everyone,\n I'm currently tasked with researching new possibilities to upgrading our current storage solutions to better fit our future and development.\n A little background on our data. We accumulate around 4PBs of data per year or so and that data rarely gets purged or removed. It is usually acquired in 2 GB files, TBs at a time. (20+ TBs per collection).\n This data gets processed on local machines or GPU/CPU clusters.\n Data is stored raw and processed.\n We currently use JBOD raids but we've found that with data storage being in the PBs, we are setting up new PB raids every few years or so and essentially \"upgrading\" them means rebuilding with new HDDs or just buying a whole new rack/raid. We also have an insane amount of file shares because of each raid.\n Would a scale out solution like CEPH or GlusterFS be a better solution? Would we be better off keeping RAID configurations? What other solutions could provide for this?\n I had a hard time wrapping my head around which solution would be best because of I/O density/etc.\n We aren't against vendor supported builds but would prefer to learn and grow our experiences in storage to provide direct support later down the road and grow our professional portfolios.\n Funding and time aren't huge issues, and we've been given some funds to build a small \"proof of concept\" for whichever system we can find that fits the criteria. This would include training/etc.\n    submitted by    /u/CameHonor  \n [link]   [comments]",

I will keep 4 SATA slots for the pool, 1 for the OS SSD and 1 extra as a temp slot, so would just like to ask a few question to confirm my understanding.\n Question 1:\n The useable pool size is 18.1 TB, so am I correct to assume 9TB would be usable?\n Is the 9 TB of data distributed across the 4 drives, so that there are always 2 copies?\n What I'm afraid of is that I do not have full redundancy across 9TB of data do to the uneven number of TBs relative to HDDs.\n Question 2:\n If I was to purchase a new 8TB drive can I easily removed a 4TB drive from the pool?\n So I would end up with 2x4TB and 2x8TB, pool size would be ~24TB with usable space ~12TB?\n    submitted by    /u/Infamousslayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

User clicks task in the app, a %TEMP%/123/45678.pdf is created (both 123 folder, and 45678.pdf). Once done the app seems to rename the contract_90123.pdf. effective permissions also show full access for this location.\n That rename appears to be intermittently failing, so the expected attachment isnt present and the email fails to generate. procmon shows 'path not found' on the rename operation.\n From the information i've gathered so far, it's an infrequent failure but when it happens appears to occur for a period of time. We appear to be fine for a week but last week we had it occur for all generated email attachments and was 100% reproducable.\n The infra is RDS2019 (6 servers) using UPD's, which runs on S2D storage. %TEMP% was not originally included in the UPD but as of an hour ago now included for testing. I doubt that will have any fix due. There's no apparent heavy resource usage or noticable performance issues when the issue occurs to suspect heavy load.\n We seem to have no other issues on the RDS's other than this rename operation failing. Running the app locally also has no problems. LoB support say it's an issue with our environment and with it only occuing on our RDS's, i'm inclined to beleive them.\n Any sugestions on what to do to further diagnose this one? due to the seeming isolated file, i'm out of ideas as anything i can come up with (eg: bad disk/ram/network) would affect far more than this.\n    submitted by    /u/veehexx  \n [link]   [comments]",

We got these small servers called zima boards, and I think they're supposed to be endpoints to kiosks and stuff, maybe get sensor data or shit like that idk they just threw me a box, rattled on about some bullshit I didn't understand(I heard mqtt so it's probably gonna be stuff like that) and said \"have fun\". I know they said \"we need to get windows on it because the users and passwords would be a burden to change\" or something like that, and I heard a conversation which mentioned that we're gonna be doing like 50 of these at a time, so I'm guessing my task is to figure out how to install windows on these without having to interact with each one first.\n My second question to anyone who knows windows, is it possible to get the users & passwords in a text file? That would mean we wouldn't have to install windows to begin with, and since it comes with a debian based distro we can just bash some bullshit together to create the users.\n oooh wait, is it possible to run a script with grub(somehow, haven't done it before) to get it to boot there? If so, then I could just run a script to install grub(if not installed), reboot, then run a script which selects the device(maybe? idk all the commands to do that but it seems reasonable right?)\n    submitted by    /u/HedgehogRoutine2695  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is the best scenario to have one or the other?\n - Does OCSP respond if the current client certificate is valid? Is this statement valid for regular CRL CDP as well? How do clients knows to check the ocsp? Is it embedded on the certificate as an AIA point?\n - I have noticed that when setting up the AIA you always point it to the root CA certificate, why is that? Regular CDP point to .crl files but not AIA.\n - If I don't set up a custom IIS server with CRL, do clients pull it from default points such as LDAP? is IIS custom CDP best practice for DMZ external clients where LDAP is not accessible? why CRLs cannot be accessed through HTTPS?\n - What is the objective of using multiple SANs in a certificate?\n - What are the considerations when migrating CAs to other servers? Does it work by backing up old CA, turn off the server CA, create the new one, install role, restore CA registry backup but manitaining IP and server name? Would that keep the default CDP and AIA settings as well as matching DNS zone records. What about the IIS servers hosting enrollment and CDPs if any? What about the NDES role if it is present?\n - Can I change renewal key lenght on capolicy.inf if certificates are required to increase key length? Is there another way to do it? What tasks are needed to be done after that?\n - What is Certificate Transparency what are CT logs?

I see 3 options here, which are below:\n  \nPurchase a step-up transformer to plug into the 120v outlet, to give the UPS 240v output\n Use two different out-of-phase outlets on different circuits and wire them to a single 240v plug\n Pay an electrician to run a new circuit dedicated for the UPS\n  \nObviously Option 3 is the most ideal option, but running a new circuit will be somewhat difficult and expensive due to the layout of my house.

After discussing pay ranges the recruiter said a Level 3 wouldn’t even pay what I was making at the time, but there was a level 4 position they hadn’t posted yet. I agreed to interview, which was supposed to be the hiring manager and a technical lead.\n Instead they ended up having 2 level 3 admins interview me. They were mostly concerned with who I knew at Rackspace and when I didn’t know anyone they wondered how I got an interview. They began asking me questions about my resume as I have a lot of varied experience. I do Exchange, AD, and VMware primarily, but have had experience with lots of other technologies as most of us on this sub have. I have worked on Exchang…",

The real nail in the coffin was Rackspace's absolutely dreadful \"support\". So far everything is working great. As of a few weeks ago our Rackspace account is fully deactivated.\n Here are the steps I recommend for other small companies that are cost-conscious:\n 1) Through Rackspace's Office 365 page, buy Rackspace-managed Office 365 licenses for all the users. These show up in 365 Admin as \"Reseller\" licenses, as opposed to licenses purchased directly from Microsoft which show up as \"Commercial direct\".\n 2) Use Rackspace's email migration tool (which is actually BitTitan MigrationWiz reskinned for Rackspace) to migrate all of the Rackspace/Hosted Exchange addresses to 365.

This was the first time in the last 12 years we live here.\n ​\n I texted back that I am sorry but I do not do any IT support outside my family, because the small issues could easily escalate in terms of time and knowledge invested and that this was abused in the past. Got no answer.\n ​\n Today I met him outside the house and was getting blasted with how angry he is and how I lack a sense of community and how \"all IT people\" tell him the same (ah?) and that we all need help (what?). And that his question would be something about his TV and that is HDD is now empty/blank.\n ​\n To top it off, he yelled at me in front of my kids while we were on our way to get a Christmas tree.\n ​\n Really?\n ​\n Am I supposed to get 'ready for work' on a Friday evening after an exhausting week to peek into something which is both outside my expertise (datacentre != TV) nor interest?\n ​\n Why is it that non-IT people seem to take it as totally granted that you fix any consumer product because \"you work in IT\".\n ​\n I am totally sick of it.

General infra like VMware, storage, sysadmin etc. I have moved to use the cloud in the last 7 years as well. I have (finally) been promoted and now find myself Head of Infrastructure.

I have two teams I supervise, an infra team of more classic sysadmins, and a DevOps team which is developers who are interested and work in infra stuff. My role is extremely hands-on around 50% still doing infrastructure engineering but I am gaining more staff so that will continue to reduce with time.\n I am planning for the future and looking at similar roles to see what I need to be aiming for. What I am interested in right now is what sort of interview questions should I expect for these sorts of roles. Since I didn't interview for my Head of role I've never had a management interview. \n What are the general questions I should expect, is there any changes to my interview style over engineering roles I need to anticipate? (I found being extremely relaxed and personable worked very well, but I understand cultural differences here come into play as London and Stockholm, where I have worked, are very relaxed environments for engineering roles where that might not be the case where you are from).

PDQ Connect is coming and looks like it's going in a good direction, but I've got almost 1,000 PC's to a manage now, so I'm open to alternatives - and the solution that keeps coming up is Microsoft Intune. \n We would like an application deployment solution that is flexible but will also let us run Powershell scripts, create groups and reports, and ideally provide a way to access the remote computer over the internet. Bonus if it works for Mac as well as Windows (though we are 99% Windows). One of the things I've seen with Intune that I really like is the ability to create PC profiles and once a user logs in to Azure AD, Intune (or Autopilot?) automatically deploys a profile to the computer. That seems powerful. \n Other thoughts on Intune as a potential alternative (or accompaniment?) to PDQ?\n    submitted by    /u/nakedmeeple  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our phone provider (a voip pbx provider using voip.ms as their trunk) says they are not able to identify the original number but have confirmed the numbers are spoofed. The attacker calls periodically and berates the receptionist looking for some information that we don't have, and has told her they will jam up our switchboards until we give them the information. This has been going on for about 3 weeks. The caller has said they are in south africa, though the numbers they call from are 10 digit north american numbers. My receptionist took it on herself to give the attacker some fake information that she thought might satiate them, but it was quickly identified as false and seemed to enrage them further.\n I discussed this with the RCMP (canadian police force) and they were able to call to one of the numbers that the attacker had called from and speak to them and told them to stop. However that was about as effective as you'd expect. The RCMP said there was nothing additional that they could do and to contact the anti-fraud division (which I'm going to be doing today with limited expectations for success)\n So, given that I am not able to block the calls as the call ID keep changing and my phone provider isn't able to identify the actual source of the calls in order to provide to law enforcement, what options remain?\n    submitted by    /u/e7c2  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I decided to step in this week and try to find the cause of this issue for once and for all.\n Everything networking at their workstations was replaced. Flyleads was tested prior to being installed, and yet the problem persisted.\n A couple of tests later, and everything pointed to either a network cable fault issue or something on the core switch.\n Today we got in the \"expert\". He followed my test steps, and agreed that there is something funky going on, it either is the cabling or the core switch.\n So off to the server room we toddled, and do a few more tests on the switch. Same results.\n So we decided to reboot the switch by pulling power and bring it back on. He wanted to warn the people, but I know that people will just be dragging out the reboot because they have \"important\" things to do. Like finish watching that youtube clip with the hot chick, or do some work on their important resume. So... power was pulled. Future me won't be pleased with myself should it come back to bite my a$$.\n Switch rebooted - and the one blade did not come back up. Found the fault, yay.\n But it also cut out the internet because our CPE was connected to that specific blade. Took a little juggling around of cables, but we got everything up again.\n Now we will have to wait for a replacement blade, but in the meantime things should be OK for now.\n And the good news is, that slowness is now gone.\n I t was bound to pop sooner or later anyway, better that it popped whilst the expert was there.\n    submitted by    /u/UrgleBurgleFloggah  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's like imposter syndrome but only because I'm doing better than some others.\n I can usually find the answer to any problem or work with the right people effectively to solve most issues but I feel like I'm lazy, I make mistakes, I don't go after certifications, I don't homelab, I have lukewarm social skills, I'm not amazing at interviews, I don't network very well, my written skills are average at best, I can't clearly state my thoughts to executives, and sometimes I'm just overall inefficient at my job. \n Yet I know I'm capable of doing my current job without a doubt, but I worry about being replaced by someone better constantly.\n So when I see someone stuck in a T1 job for like 4 years, it makes me question whether or not I deserve to be in IT Manager role after only 6 years.

          "description": "I have been in IT for more than 25 years, and had about a dozen jobs in various companies/industries of different sizes. I never really liked IT, but was generally good at it and it paid well. The best jobs are when I had a fun team, worst have been from bad management. I eventually change jobs for whatever reason: company closing, management, bored, whatever. I have always thought about changing professions during my career, but I don’t know if I would feel better doing that or not. Or have any idea what I would do anyway. I don’t like the idea of continually changing jobs, especially in my 50s, I average about 2-3 years per job, but I am pretty sure I am not in the right place to finish my career in 15-20 years.\n I never felt fulfilled or proud of my career path, and dread mondays and going into the office 3 times a week, but the days go by quickly given that every day is different. All in all, things are ok, I’m hybrid, get paid well, little work outside my 40 hours, my management leaves me alone, I’ve always gotten good reviews when I had them. I don’t really connect with my team, and fear I would be released if layoffs come. Some days, it’s a struggle staying above water from both the complexity and quantity of work, most days I stare at the clock waiting for quitting time.\n For the most part I’ve been an admin: windows, linux, storage, virtualization, cloud, and dabbled a bit in of security, databases, scripting, networking. Not sure if I should stay where I am, switch to a similar job as admin, change to something like IT security , or change careers entirely.\n Where are you at? Experiencing the same feelings? Am I burnt out or being whiny?\n    submitted by    /u/valclobo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Our current environment includes 2 sites while each site has 1 Windows server (to work as DC, DHCP and print server) + 1 Windows file server. GPOs are in place to mount network drives and printers. We also have NSA to work as firewalls and VPN connections for remote users.\n Our major plan is to replace the file servers with Nasuni edge appliances. That will bring us 'small cache file server' to each location. But the executives are considering replacing the current DCs to cloud VM. \n From my premature understanding of cloud resources, this looks possible by running a VM with site-to-site VPN connection to on prem networks.

Then they forgot the code.. and the devices had already been deleted from airwatch....\n I've looked online and all I really see are jailbreakers and paid pin unlock suites, I'm wondering if anyone knows of a free tool that can either remove the pin, or fully factory reset the devices (I've tried iTunes and the usual recovery with no joy), or if there is a way to re-enroll the devices back into airwatch temporarily to use the pin removal tool?\n    submitted by    /u/afwmftw  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m six months into this new job and have suddenly been thrown into a couple projects. \n Unfortunately for me, my boss threw me into an ongoing project cycle due to one of our sys admins being out for several weeks, so I’m in the fire. I’ve been given a technical documentation by our vendor which I’m told is full of useless and confusing information and I need to basically decipher and translate it to work for the environment we have. I’m still new to our environment and applications so figuring out how to make this work within our infrastructure is extremely daunting. There are people I can ask for help but many of them are busy with their own tasks and projects and I don’t want to come off as helpless. \n The company I work for is ridiculously understaffed and unorganized, so there is zero structure or timeline to these projects as well as very conflicting deadlines. I’ve literally been asked if it was possible to take this new project given to me and implement the entire thing in a non prod environment within 24 hours, no freaking way. All the while being asked by product managers and my boss for constant updates on other projects assigned to me. It’s extremely soul crushing. I’m so new to everything that it seems impossible to get anything done within the time frames they’re asking for and give updates. The micro managing is extremely severe to the point where I am asked for a project update every single hour, most of the time I’m still trying to figure out what to do and don’t have an answer. If I’m lucky one of the more senior guys will schedule a meeting with me later in the day to point me in the right direction.

Things I can easily do in vSphere are either overly complicated or just don’t work as well. \n The two things holding me back from going vSphere are keeping uniformity across systems and the uncertainty of the Broadcom deal. \n I’ve got more experience with vSphere which is why I’m leaning that way and can easily justify the extra licensing on the cost our MSP would charge for all the migrations if we went hyper-v. \n Any thoughts or advice?\n    submitted by    /u/boomernetd  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is all pretty new to me except I am familiar with basic networking. I'm looking for an all in one guide or video to learn the basics and get a good grasp before jumping off the deep end.\n I'll be working with Teams (Direct Routing + Operator Connect), Zoom Phones, Cisco Call Manager, and some Vonage. I've already gone through some knowledge base articles with these vendors but I still don't feel like I have a good baseline. I'm not looking for how to use these specifically more like what is a SBC, how do number translations work, what's a SIP trunk, PTSN vs toll-free, etc. Anyone able to point me in the right direction for something like this?\n Thanks!!\n    submitted by    /u/Fecesman  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there,\n I am a sysadmin in a company and I manage around ~170 Servers. Some of them are phyiscal, some virtual. Most of them run Windows Server 2012 / 2016 /2019 as their OS, but we also got some Linux Servers.\n So now our issue: We literally got almost no documention for our servers. We have list of our hostnames, but that is it.\n To better understand our current state: Recently our main FTP Server broke down because the Windows OS was broken. The server was not bootable anymore and therefore the config for the FTP server (IIS) was lost. Of course, no one knew how the FTP Service was configured in terms of directories, local users and other software. So we build up a new Server from scratch (which was the easy part) and talked to every service provider usising this FTP Server and telling them that the credentials and hostname / IP has changed (which was the not so nice part).\n We recently got the brilliant idea that it might be good to know what kind of Servers we have, which applications they are running and how they are configured.\n The first idea from one of my colleagues was to make a word document for every server, where we can wright the specs inside, which applications it runs and what steps were taken to configure the software (with screenshots). But yeah, let's just not do that....\n And now my question: What is the best practice for Server documentation? I googled a bit of course and found some tools for documentation, but most of them are not free for testing or just don't look that good to use.\n The way to document should have some kind automation to it and have a nice usability, so that my colleagues stay motivated to document.\n So should be just something dull like Word, Excel or Visio (which is easy but frustrating to use) or some kind of software, which scans our servers and document them? I think a hybrid of both things would be nice\n    submitted by    /u/Sp4stie  \n [link]   [comments]",

If they then take that laptop to site Y, deploy printer Y on login but remove printer X. The plan is the queue name would be the same on each server so to the end user it \"looks\" like one queue wherever they go\n Is that even possible?

          "description": "We use shared local admin accounts with password auth on the infrastructure I inherited (~6 admins, many (hundreds) of machines). This worries me, any ex employee will still have access unless we go and change a lot of passwords. Automation is not really a thing here yet (I know, I know).\n Looking for a better solution I started to create an ansible playbook to roll out authentication via sssd/ldap. This basically works, everyone from the \"sysadmin\" group can now login via ssh and their individual passwords on my test machine. Accounts are automatically granted sudo rights based on group membership.\n Now, I have a couple of questions with respect to this approach:\n  \nIs there a way to preseed the sssd cache before first login? An admin might have to handle an emergency on a machine he’s never logged into and at that moment ldap might not be available. If not, any recommended alternative approaches?\n \nI would prefer key auth over passwords but I don’t have much control over the AD/LDAP infrastructure so I don’t think I can store public keys there (and delegate ssh key lookup / caching to sssd). I could rollout and revoke keys via ansible but I’m unsure on how that would play with sssd/ldap. Like, when an account is locked in AD but still has an authorized key, can they still login?\n \nGiven all admins have sudo rights, what would be required steps to make sure they can't access servers after they left? E.g. would we have to cleanout their authorized_keys in addition to disabling their users in AD/LDAP?\n \n Any inputs are appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/No-Finger-42  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a heavy workload, learning new systems, addressing incident and request tickets, and creating and executing projects with a lot of moving targets and deadlines. \n I’m still green so this also plays into a frustration with handling items a bit slower than I’d like. I also know that I tend to ‘take on the world’ and feel reluctant to ask for help too soon. It is important that I do my due diligence before leaning into my team as I want to ensure I am carrying my weight. Getting my hands on things is also the best way for me to learn.\n As I’m writing this post I believe I may just need to vent but also ask as to whether this is the norm as a sys eng? Because if so, I truly need to adjust in the way that I handle my work and the way it ties into my mood and stress level.\n What’s y’all experience, strategies, and coping mechanisms?\n    submitted by    /u/Low-Juggernaut-1164  \n [link]   [comments]",

Upon rebooting the server everything looked fine, but we were recieving multiple calls asking if something was down, or if it was safe to log in again.\n I was thinking, it would be great if the IT department had a website we could share with users to just have us post a quick \"this server went down, but services will be restored soon.\" or \"Reminder, we are doing maintenance tonight at 10PM\" messages that staff could view throughout the day. Mostly just a status and maintenance update kind of site that we can send out when there's a known issue and an all clear.\n The purpose would be, of course, if there is something acting up, staff can bring up the page quick and see that there is a problem and what we're doing to resolve, so they do not have to call in or wonder and call us to ask.\n I'm imaging like a live webpage that we can post messages, but have them read only and not allow for replies, new items go to the top and old messages are pushed down over time. Maybe we can mark older issues a resolved and important information like \"If you continue to have issues, please try logging off and back in for better performance.\"\n Anyway, does that make sense? Is there anything like that we can utilize? I know we can send out emails to staff/groups for updates, but many things do not need to go to all staff, and not all staff need to be aware of issues impacting just certain groups or applications. We were thinking maybe Teams would have something like that, but even so Teams seems a bit underwhelming for that.

From disabled accounts to old computers/servers, they just disable them and let them be (they been doing this for like 10+ years).\n A couple months ago we started a project to clean everything and we still havent found a way to safely delete every disabled user/system (they never do it especially cause they hire a lot of consultants and a lot of them come and go and they just enable/disable their users).\n Pretty cool thing I just discovered (mind I have 0 exp on the area Im literally new on the job) is that you can export/import users. So I thought about exporting them, storage them in any fileserver and delete them from AD. If we ever decide to use them again we just import them with their groups and stuff like they where when we disabled it. Would this work?. \n Another suggestion we had was to make \"parallel OUs\" and storage every disabled/thing in the same OU with some kind of designated name like \"Logistic Users - Disabled\" or something like that. But this would still invovle having EVERY disabled thing still there.\n ​\n What do you guys do to keep AD clean?.\n Is there any tool to keep track of disabled/enabled users?

The owners of the 3000+ people company I work for bought three small companies (around 60 people total) about a month ago and want to merge those companies into one new company (our company will operate independently) with a new domain, Azure tenant, email, etc. IT was not involved in any of the initial discussions until the deal closed. We were told to drop everything and focus on this project but as other teams complain up the chain, the drop everything and focus on the merger goes out the window.\n ​\n This project needs to get done by December 31st and there's no leeway on that time. We talked to some consulting companies and even they say getting it done by end of the year, especially with the US holidays is not possible. We have also been told that if this doesn't get done by end of the year, we may all be looking for new jobs. Oh, did I mention that we still do not have any access to the other companies yet to even start any migration, IT from the other companies are dragging their feet with this information.\n ​\n I guess this is where the rant/frustration comes in, but with a message like that from our management and a timeline that does not seem achievable by companies that dedicate their business to mergers (consultants), I don't get what chance our small and understaffed team of IT people have at getting this done by end of the year.

Many folks on here talk about homelabbing, and I'm slowly but surely spinning up things with Azure credits and Raspberri Pis, but at the end of the day, all of my work relies on internet research. If some yahoo on StackOverflow says to set it up one way or another, there's little I can do to verify that this is a conceptually sound process, because I lack the experience - I don't know what I don't know.\n Of course, many people would next say 'get the experience.' But how can one do that if one does not have the experience to get the job in the first place? That is to say, my goal is working my way into systems administration. In such a job they might want me to produce an effective backup storage solution, but if my knowledge comes from tainted sources, how can I do this? It seems like so, so many organizations are running with these barebones IT teams where there's really limited opportunity to start as a junior admin and learn under them over time.\n    submitted by    /u/stempoweredu  \n [link]   [comments]",

Users in the Office put files in the machines through network share. \n Found out the connection they use is SMBv1, which is a security risk.\n I have been tasked to find a solution for it.\n First of all they can upgrade their system to the latest OS but its going to cost them a lot, which they'd like to avoid. They also like to avoid using USB Sticks and keep walking from the Office to the machines.\n I thought of using a NAS(Network Attached Storage) but I don't think this is going to work because the NAS needs to place files in the machine, which I have no clue how to do that, or is this even possible.\n Second, the machines don't need access to the internet at all. I preferably like to isolate the machines from the internal network, which can be done with a NAS.\n Finally, disable access to the internet on the machines and leave it as it is, which is not secure.\n Any idea's how to solve this?\n    submitted by    /u/Cak3Yay  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're small, we don't send bulk email, it's just not appropriate for our customer base. We had SPF configured, and that was working well (i.e. we didn't notice it not-working).\n Last week we started getting \"550 5.7.1\" errors from any emails sent to a google hosted domain.\n I'm going through the advice on Google's support pages and it's all targeted at bulk-senders and so on. We have a 100% \"Bad\" reputation for our IPs (from November 2) and a \"Bad\" reputation for the Domain since August. I suspect this is due to some entries in our SPF entry which includes a slightly dodgy hosting company. We use an external ERM tool which is hosted there and I added their IP ranges to the SPF. Since then the email config has changed and it's not required to add their IPs to my SPF.\n On Friday I removed all the SPF records bar the microsoft one and I set up DKIM and DMARC.\n I'm getting green lights on all the DMARC dashboards for our DNS setup. I can see email headers are containing all the good stuff and I am receiving reports from recipient servers with confirmation that my DMARC is good.\n But, we're still not able to send to any google hosted domains. What further steps can I take to heal my domain's reputation, and how can I get some more warning on this in future?\n    submitted by    /u/fishter_uk  \n [link]   [comments]",

Those apps source the SMTP Adress from the AD mail property. I really don't like this setup, but that's something grown.\n However, this is making some trouble with syncing to the cloud, since those SMTP adresses are already registerd with the tenant of the supplier, which makes absolutely sense.

I decided to leave this job due to being the only on site IT resource, which required 7 day weeks with 10 hours on site and the rest on-call from Black Friday through New Years Eve without receiving any extra pay during those times. In addition this company treats IT needs with extremely low priority until an outage stops production, and kept moving my office anytime someone decided they wanted that space (currently I am in a mice-infested storage closet). \n I found out late last week that they will not be able to hire a replacement for me until after the new year aside from a weekend temp that has almost no IT experience (weekday needs will be covered remotely by the already-stretched-thin corporate office). This is likely to mean outages that will cause them to miss SLAs and put an already threatened facility perilously close to being shut down. \n Should I feel guilty about this? I’m getting lots of guilt trips but find myself not really giving a crap. \n My wife suggested offering to do consultant work for them on my off hours, but called me an asshole for saying that I wouldn’t even think about it for less than $250 an hour.\n Edit: For those questioning if the office moves were real, here are some photos (censored so I don’t dox myself): https://imgur.com/a/CnPwoiu/\n    submitted by    /u/infinite_zero  \n [link]   [comments]",

The job could have been automated but the guy running that division ( a completely different one ) did not want to agree to take on task of data modeling every issue out to be resolved. \n I'm very gifted and could do it all in a 2 hours but was groomed to stretch it out because it would mean the next guy had impossible metrics. I had an entire blockbusters worth of movies in my cubical and started coming in at 6 pm working till 2 am to put 8 hours in no one would see was just watching movies for 6 hours. \n Then I got into a feud with an upstream division that logged everything on Friday at 4pm meaning I couldn't go to the bars to drink with my highschool friends. I complained once and they said they would stop, the next week they slammed me with double so I just signed off and went to the bar. \n Over 5 million dollars got misplaced because I didn't file the work and it raised holy hell with the C execs. I walked into a strong arm meeting where they tried putting me on the fire and just said \"I quit\" right away and suddenly they were my best friends and asking me what I'd want from a fulltime job. \n I said nothing and trained my poor replacement who was an average joe family man and he literally cried as I walked out the door.

          "description": "Hi All,\n Our small organization has been archiving media content with our own tape library as a standard practice for some time solely dedicated to our ingest/post-production footage, now we are expanding tape backup writing for other non-critical departments.\n The other departments have had a few TBs backed up in their \"unlimited\" (Google) cloud storage using our corporate network for a few years, now we need a mechanism to access the content in the cloud and download them to an on-premise storage machine with access to writing to the tape library. Additionally, a checksum validation of the files should be done after writing to tape. \n So far we expect existing content to be around 12-15TB for the newly included department, the data is expected to grow to maybe 20-25% per year. This content will need to be stored for 8 years for data compliance, and we cannot maintain a single (cloud) copy for their department, hence writing to tape is a hard requirement here. \n What we have so far as a current setup is, \n  \nMac machine with an in-built storage of maybe 500GB free space currently.\n Access to the cloud content via the desktop application (Google Drive).\n Standalone tape writer with connectivity to the mac via thunderbolt 2 (We don't have the infra for a windows system to connect to standalone tape writer as of now)\n Rewritable LTO-7 Tapes @ 15TB capacity\n  \nFull disclosure, on our side of IT we have not been looking into the tape writing side until this requirement came up. On a high level, this new project seems to be very tedious as the backup will be of many individual objects, and not sure whether an MD5 checksum for a list of files contained in a folder using the mac terminal is possible, or if somebody can suggest a safe third-party software app. \n Would like to know what will be the best approach here? Is using the mac as the storage medium the best option also? We don't plan on investing in external hardware.\n    submitted by    /u/Klipspringer112  \n [link]   [comments]",

We do not host any domains, or any services for that matter, that would allow someone to find out the IP's of the sites remotely. Except for a select few, none of the IP's are SWIP'd in arin either.\n So that leads me to be believe someone on the guest wifi at these sites does something to piss someone off on the internet, or its a random/driveby/typo. Typically they are short lived, single incident or maybe two within an evening/day.\n Its almost always in 1hr or 2 hour intervals, which leads me to believe its a DDOS for hire type thing. Always volumetric, so dns/udp/icmp reflection/fragmentation. So since its volumetric and these sites dont have bgp, there isnt anything we can do from our end.\n Most providers arent that helpful, because they want you to pay for their DDOS protection service, which is normally at least 2x+ the MRC of the actual internet service itself.\n Dealing with one now that is lumen/centurylink. Had an event Monday evening, then again last night (didnt notice this as it was 12am) and now this evening again. We stopped using the IP they were hitting, changed the NAT pool to a new IP, but they are still hitting the old IP. To their credit they did do some filtering Monday, but said it was a one time thing and we needed to talk to our account rep. Looking at the bandwidth graph on the lumen portal, looks like it starts out at over 1gbps, but then settles in around 700-800mbps, and we only have 500mbps at the site. Im inclined to just go to 1gbps if im going to throw money at something, but they could just throw more DDOS at it at that point.\n Anyone have any thoughts on this other than it sucks?

Then after we came back to the office he had to clean out the guys office and put it into a box and discovered the biggest pile of pornography known to man he had created on thousands of CDs, disks, zip drives. They found the guy had written macros completely automating his job and spent 100% of his time collecting, indexing and catologing porn for absolutely no reason. \n If I recall right ( I was drunk when told so could be wrong ) the company had to call the police incase anything illegal was on the disks but it was so much they didn't have the time/budget to go through it all. They tried speaking with the guy but he had moved out of state when his building access got locked. \n In the end the sysadmin got the full fury of the company for not knowing what was going on and the poor admin spent 2-3 months 7 days a week working to create and implement new security processes and traveling to every branch to install them.\n The guy was only caught because one of our female coworkers had been in the adult industry briefly when she was younger and he somehow recognized her ( they said he had a photographic memory ) and accessed the HR database on her home addresse which was monitored by law.\n I will say this for the company. They put the sysadmin through 3 months of hell but once he finished they gave him a promotion and paid vaca.\n Edit: Because people are saying he stalked her. The sysadmin was able to speak with him once via his mother and the guy said he wasn't trying to stalk her only to put her address into the index he made. He was brilliant but OCD about data. That's what made him good at his job.\n    submitted by    /u/PCouture  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I got approval from the IT manager to audit all login/logoff/login failure activity and put it in a database.\n So, I turned the auditing GPO's on, however they feel very junky and the login failure logging doesn't even seem to work. Current issues:\n - Someone logs in and event viewer logs it 4 times and than it says the account logged out 3 times, even though all he did was log in once.- Someone fills in bad passwords, but nothing appears in the event viewer even though the GPO's are turned on for auditing/logging this.\n Is there a way to make it more reliable and work? Or is there a better option that I'm unaware of?\n ​\n Edit: I'm just a junior network and sysadmin, they won't even bother listening to me implementing a paid system since I'm very new to the company. I've been working on making a Powershell script that nitpicks and exports the Event Viewer data to the DB and from there on to a Grafana Dashboard.

Help me through this!\n Currently, we don't require MFA for users who are connecting via the corporate network (we've applied exceptions when users log in when their device is connected to the corporate network). But, now somewhere I read, 'you should require MFA even if you're connecting via the corporate networks'\n After analyzing lots of stuff, most of the answers turned me into a dilemma mode. Having to require multi-factor authentication within corporate networks may be tiresome, but if you don't require MFA while connecting via a corporate network, you won't be able to implement zero trust within your organization.\n What are your opinions on this?

So I'm looking for what can cause such a mess, because in the last 4 years, I did'nt touch the farm configuration, but the client did (and the client has changed his IT team twice over the 4 last years).\n For information, it's a 2016 RDS farm with a lot of RDSH, but the main part is the 2 RD Broker, with a database hosted on 2 SQL boxes, with alwaysOn, 2 RD gateways, 2 RD WebAccess and 2 RD licence servers.\n Everything works fine until you manually (or after a reboot) change the replica's owner from the SSMS, then the active broker logs that it cannot contact the database, and everything failed (I waited for more than an hour to be sure, but nothing automatically fixes the mess).\n If I use the cmdlets Get-RDConnectionBrokerHighAvailability, I can see that the database connection is made on the AlwaysOn Listner as expected. The only weird things is that in the registry the database connection is set to one of the SQL servers instead (in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tssdis\\Parameters\\DBConnString)\n Anyone can help me troubleshoot this ?\n    submitted by    /u/CyricFirehands  \n [link]   [comments]",

Note: The out-of-band updates for DCs released November 17, 2022 and November 18, 2022 might be affected by this issue.\n Workaround: To mitigate this issue, open Command Prompt as Administrator and use the following command to set the registry key KrbtgtFullPacSignature to 0:\n reg add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\KDC\" -v \"KrbtgtFullPacSignature\" -d 0 -t REG_DWORD \n Note: Once this known issue is resolved, you should set KrbtgtFullPacSignature to a higher setting depending on what your environment will allow.

          "description": "(small business so not a lot of VMs (about 40) but still)\n I woke up a few days ago (late in the day because working late) to find that our hypervisors lost connection to the storage server. All of the virtual machines still running without disks basically. The storage server basically died on me while I was asleep at home. After fixing issues with the storage server (some faulty hardware and a failing RAID), I powered back on our hypervisors and started restoring from backups.\n For a minute, I thought we lost all of our data, all of our servers, and were not going to be able to bring anything back online for a few days. But I was able to fix everything wrong with the storage server (since the power issue was due to a PCIe card failing, and did maintainence) and bring back online most of our VMs without issue. The only VM we lost was a test server that was created that night. \n Although I was able to recover basically everything, I still have decided to improve our backups and retention system. It was a life safer this time but I think we definitely could have better backups. \n It's things like this that make you not regret doing the extra work for backups and fail safes (even if they might suck to set up at times). Made me definitely feel good about my backup systems and plan in case this kinda thing happens. Now I'm taking what I had before and adding on top of it; since I have an actual reference incident to go off of.\n    submitted by    /u/BouncyPancake  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this. I’ll keep my background brief: I’m still fairly green in the IT field as a whole, let alone as a sysadmin. I have only been working full time post-college for almost two years now, and this is my first job straight out of the gate as the sole IT resource on-site for a company of roughly 250 users and growing rapidly.\n I have some assistance from an MSP, someone who I can bounce questions off of and turn to in a pinch. Outside of that, I’m alone. To say it’s been stressful is an understatement. My company expects me on call 24/7 and everyone has my personal cell and abuses it and refuses to use a ticketing system. All that aside, I want to ask for help, as that is the only foreseeable alternative to me up and quitting. While I have been looking for other jobs, I haven’t actually had a talk with my bosses about how I’m feeling. Mainly because I am not the first IT guy in this role, which has always been filled by one person. I don’t want to be seen as “that guy” who can’t handle it like the previous guys did and ask for an extra person, as I feel like that would just make them look down on me. I know that probably seems dumb, that’s just where my head goes. Like I said, at this point getting some help is the only thing that would make me stay for longer. I just don’t know how to approach my bosses and what to even say. Does anyone have any advice or been in a similar situation?\n Thanks for reading.\n    submitted by    /u/DenryFoof  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some say everything should be virtual, others suggest a physical DC.\n The issue we're trying to address is at present all our DCs are virtual - all our hypervisors are Hyper-V\n We recently did a full shutdown to carry out some electrical work. What we realized is that if the DCs didn't come backup automatically for whatever reason with the hypervisor then we wouldn't be able to authenticate with domain credentials onto the Hyper-V host.\n Alternatively I guess we could use local admin, but we use LAPs so again we need domain access to pull up the local admin password.\n As a bonus question - we have a Veeam backup solution which is also currently virtualised. Again my question is should this be physical? It's not using tapes, just backing up to separate SANs.\n If we couldn't get into our virtual environment, we wouldn't be able to do anything with our Veeam backups? We'd have to quickly build a Veeam server to access and restore our backups? Am i missing something\n    submitted by    /u/The-Hound-of-Hades  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically I am looking at the Dell 4128 vs 6300M models.\n Dell is priced very well with 5 years support and prodeploy included. Everything looks great with them and all my servers and SANs are Dell. Some have said some negative things about Dell switches on this forum, weird CLI, difficult to work with, but those comments seem to be related more to OS9/Force10 and not OS10.\n On the other hand, all my access switches are Aruba and they have been flawless. Ive heard a lot of good things about Aruba and they were rated very well in the 2021 gartner report for wired and wireless LAN. Dell doesn't even seem to rank on this report. The Aruba quote is around 1.7x the price of the Dell quote. \n I'm running Cisco currently. They aren't a contender because they absolutely blew the doors off with their price.

          "description": "I'm relatively new to the linux side of things, I switched my homelab over from mostly windows to almost pure linux to really learn it. I recently started dabbling in ansible and holy hell, it feels like I unlocked a cheat code. I can do things that would normally take me half hour+ to just as long as it takes to type the command out. My whole infra can be updated immediately, and I can make any change I want instantly to as many or as few servers as I want.\n I recently stood zabbix up, and I was able to get snmpd installed, configured, and the firewall ports opened opened on all dozen or so of my vm's by just typing out a playbook. I was so proud of myself when I checked the systems I ran it against and everything was exactly how I had specified in the playbook. I've still a lot to learn about ansible, but I really am kicking myself now for not looking at it sooner. I want to try and look into deploying new vm's with it next and work on automating a lot of tasks like updates, and get a better understanding of grouping devices.\n Learning linux has made me really loathe working with windows at my job, and I hope to one day make the jump to linux administration.\n    submitted by    /u/ShittyExchangeAdmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n Just wanting to get some of your input about this, a client has asked me a job spec as I've recommended they hire a full time IT presence rather than fully relying on my MSP as there are too many gaps in the infrastructure that would be too expensive to sort via the MSP. \n They currently don't have any IT staff so it would be a sole role with general support stuff, maintaining infrastructure, going ahead with minor upgrades, creating documentation and standardising some operations. With the MSP dealing with a lot of the larger upgrades, projects, patching, auditing and improvement recommendations.\n The infrastructure is quite small, manageable and not too complex but with a lot of room and time to learn and progress personally. I'm just wondering what job title you would expect to see this as? Part of me thinks it should be IT manager since they'll be the only onsite IT responsibility. On the other hand a lot of it will be dealt with by the MSP and the tasks required wouldn't require a seasoned manager as the MSP will be a fall back, so it seems like a good role for someone somewhat experienced to step up in terms of responsibility.\n Just wondering what your thoughts and points are? I don't want to recommend hiring a SysAdmin and them falling out of depth, being underpaid for the job and unhappy but on the contrary, I don't want to tell my client to overspend on someone who is overqualified and would get bored.\n    submitted by    /u/xDroneytea  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd be really grateful for some answers if anybody knows. Resellers sometimes don't know/understand everything correctly. Beeing able to fact check them is always a good idea.\n Our reseller is pretty solid, so I doubt they'll do the \"get it wrong on purpose to sell more expensive packages\"... \n ​\n So starting October Windows Server can be licensed per virtual core. With a minimum of 8 virtual cores per VM.\n Question 1:\n When they say virtual cores do they really mean virtual \"cores\" or do they mean virtual threads. Basically can I have a vm with 16 threads assigned and only use a 8 core licenses?\n With physical cores it was actual cores. So our 2x16C server has 32 Cores and we needed 32 core licenses. But could use 64 threads as they are all multithreaded.\n ​\n Question 2:\n Are existing physical core licenses we have now automaticall virtual core licenses as well?\n We have 32 Core licenses. Which allowed us to run 2 windows servers maximum. If they are now virtual core licenses as well. We could theoretically run 4 windows servers with 8 cores each.\n ​\n Question 3:\n All client/device CALs need to be either subscription or with SA. is another prereq from what I gathered.\n Is that referring to windows server CALs only. Or exchange CALs as well. What about RDP CALs?\n Our windows server and exchange CALs have SA so we are good with those. But our RDP CALs do not. Will that preclude us from using these new virtual core licenses for an RDP server?\n ​\n any feedback most appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/remosito  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems pretty full featured. It hasn't been maintained for over a year, and I haven't yet tested a restore.. But essentially the tool:\n 1) Connects to your tenant\n 2) Exports all the config into JSON\n 3) Organises that into folders\n 4) Puts it on any storage you can access\n I've tested the backup in my (very small) tenant, and it seems to work really, really well. \n There's full documentation for the module in the repo for further reading, just wanted to make people aware of it's existence.\n Remember; MS don't back any of this stuff up. If you made a mistake or some disgruntled, over privileged monkey trashes your environment the day they leave, they won't help you. Unlikely? Yes. Impossible? No. \n Personally, I'm going to setup some Azure storage and then automate the script to run once a week and export everything there. \n Hope someone finds this useful.

It’s a cobbled together network with no servers so nothing more than a UniFi router and switches and some APs, and most of my time is spent just doing tier 1 help desk crap and attempting to make some sort of sense of data management for a video production company that uses 30-60tb a quarter and wants all of it accessible at any time and doesn’t want to delete anything and also doesn’t understand why a production RAID isn’t a backup. \n I’ve digressed a bit because my ACTUAL question is: even as a very quick learner and problem solver, am I just dead in the water being so out of the loop on industry standard systems and practices? Once upon a time I was a student admin for the defense department in the late 90’s early 00’s so I’m very in the loop in a general way and have plenty of hoop-jumping experience having worked for DOD and dealt with about every major red tape hurdle you could think of for IT and dev teams given the GsA phonebooks of rules and restrictions, BUT I just get dejected looking at current posting when they list about 5-10 different things I’ve never dealt with in my life because there hasnt been a need in my current career path. So I guess what I’m asking is, am I just super behind and if so, is there a resource anyone could recommend for “learning what it is I need to learn about” if that makes sense? I am fully capable of learning a new skill or system very rapidly but I just don’t know where to begin after being left “unsupervised” for this long.

          "description": "Hello fellow sysadmins, I'm having a tough time figuring this one out, or I may just be running in circles. Does Remote Desktop Gateway only support NTLM authentication or is there a way to get it to use Kerberos? No matter what I've tried it always authenticates with NTLM to the Gateway, whether I am on premise or at home using KDCProxy. I've scoured every post on the net I can find but there's no straight answer on this. I've tried the flags rdgiskdcproxy:i:1 (my KDCProxy is my Gateway) and that didn't work. I am running NLA but I don't want to turn that off as that offers protection. I'm aware that NTLM is the protocol that will never die at this point, but if there is a way to implement Kerberos I would love some assistance.

          "description": "Let me start this by saying this whole situation is utter hell, but it's a necessity.\n I have a server that came from a company we acquired. On this server, let's call it HV1, we have a HyperV installation with 2 DC's, an APP/RDS Server and a DB server (MS Access), and all of these servers are on Server 2012 R2. This host is sitting cold on the network and will never touch the wider internet. On the APP/RDS server is a proprietary software that was developed by the former company over the course of 15 years and there's no documentation. It talks to MS Access files on the DB server and there is a mapped drive to these files on the APP/RDS server. The software is loaded from the APP/RDS server and seems to be very tied into the domain with domain authentication and will not boot unless one of the two DCs is powered on. If the DCs are off, I get some SQL network errors saying the system cannot contact a DC to service the auth request. Boot them on, the software loads and asks for credentials.\n I now need to repurpose this G9 server and use it for production, which means I need to migrate this setup away from this host and onto an older server which can continue sitting cold for X time. Essentially, replicating the entire setup from one server to another, and the only difference being that I'll be moving it to VMware instead of using HyperV. Instant concern when I was asked for this was the domain controllers.\n I've done the initial backup & restore using Veeam, and I now have all of the servers sat on my new host. The problem of course is the domain and DCs - They aren't functional/working and that domain essentially is non-existent at the moment.\n Before I go any further, I want to have a think about the potential best ways to bring these DCs back to life, purely for the purpose of getting this application working again.\n Thoughts?\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/thisisrossonomous  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, the \"side business\" uses exclusively Azure\n We don't have auto enrolment available to use, and are relying on users logging in on the new laptop. The problem then is that the user becomes local admin, which is bad. The solution to this has been to create an entry in user account protection that sets the only admins as \"administrator\" (local admin) and a special pcadmin account we created on Azure AD. To my understanding, this is fine\n The issue we have though, is if we need to support a user remotely, we can't elevate privileges in Bomgar (BeyondTrust) using the Azure account, it only seems to support local user accounts. This hasn't been a problem as we were with the users logging into their laptops, so we could set the admin password at the machine, but the case has arisen where I need to do something on a laptop which was bought and remains in another country\n I was hoping I could, as a temporary workaround, add a PS script to enable and set the local admin password, but either it's not working or the laptop just won't sync, because it's not made a difference\n Is there a solution to my problem, or do I need to take a few steps back and make some bigger changes to our system (other than auto-enrolment)\n ​\n Bonus question - my employer will pay for training courses.

It doesn't crash, but the entire browser becomes unresponsive for 8-10 seconds. Same result with Chrome and Firefox. The majority has Teams, Outlook, a few Excel sheets, a few Chrome tabs and MS Edge open, which uses around 30% CPU and 60% RAM altogether.\n I tested it on the local thinclient browser and it runs fine there, so the problem only seems to persists on the VDIs.\n    submitted by    /u/Themistokles1  \n [link]   [comments]",

We simply used the Schannel registry method to disable strong mapping, but we'd like to fix the issue properly. The doc below from Microsoft leaves a lot to be desired in terms of what to do with AD CS and existing cert templates. \n It sounds like using an additional field in the Alternative Subject Name might do the trick, but should I enable that on the existing certificate template and wait for clients to auto renew, or issue a new one? Issuing a new one seems wise so it can be dished out in stages for testing, but it's unclear if the correct cert will be chosen if two exist in the user's personal store. \n Do we also need to issue new certs for the actual NPS server? \n https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/kb5014754-certificate-based-authentication-changes-on-windows-domain-controllers-ad2c23b0-15d8-4340-a468-4d4f3b188f16#bkmk_additionalresources\n Appreciate any insight.\n    submitted by    /u/save_earth  \n [link]   [comments]",

Did all of the real talent holding things together just leave?\n Years ago, i would open a support request, get a response in 6-24 hours, work with a 1st tier support, get escalated once or twice, then work with someone that really knew the product, or watch as the person i was working with gave KVM control to some mythical support tier person that would identify an issue and return a fix. It could be AD, Exchange, windows server, etc. It was slow, but as long as your persisted, you would eventually get to someone that could fix your issue.\n In the last few years though, something has changed. I get passed between queues. I get told to make changes that take services offline. Simple things like \"the cloud shell button works everywhere but in the exchange admin web console\" gets passed around until i get an obviously thoughtless response of i ...\"need to have a subscription to Exchange to use the cloud shell.\"\n This extended beyond cloud services. I've had a number of tickets for other microsoft products that get no where. I've received calls from support personnel angry that i would agree to close a ticket that has not been fixed.

He'd kept the IT dept running on a small budget while putting in the overtime and working weird hours to patch things outside of business time. He made no bones about being overworked but it was obvious he wasn't going anywhere since he'd been there for so long (at least, that's what I had assumed given his long tenure with the company - 15+ years).\n Requests for a larger budget to replace equipment and grow the IT department were universally rejected. There has only been one exception recently which was the addition of my position to the IT team. Apparently this is something my boss had been pushing for years since the company is doing really well and expanding across the board. \n 8 or 9 weeks ago some shit hit the fan, one of the higher ups spoke to my overworked boss in a way that definitely was not well received. All of this revolved around a situation that I'm sure could have been avoided with properly scaling IT to the company's growth. My boss put in his 2 week notice on the spot.\n Fast forward to today - servers are down and multiple services and network storage drives are inaccessible. There are 3 of us at the help desk with no clue how to fix it. There are plenty applicants and interviews to fill the position but I can only assume the salary offers are too low since none of the people who come through are ever heard from again.\n A large part of the company is dead in the water today.

(and feels good for a change of pace.)\n I was thinking about the 8 companies I've worked at over the past 22 years other than the super small companies with 1 or 2 people in the whole IT department every place I've worked at has so many wasted hours. \n I've hired on at more than one place where they are going on about being swamped and then it's two weeks before I even get a laptop and spend half the day chatting with everyone or listening to them complain about policies. \n Then in every place with a team of people, there have always one or two superstars and the rest are just there either doing busy work or not really doing anything. \n Next are all the meetings, the bigger the company the more you have, and the more you just get invited to for no reason other than you replied to an email one time. Of course, there are always people who just love to take advantage of this rather than get work done. \n I've been on both sides of it too. I worked at one place in the early 2000s where I spent six months going to quiet rooms in the building and spending the day playing Civilization V without anyone noticing or caring. I've also been the superstar who's spent a solid 30-40 hours a week getting something done. \n This is just my opinion but overall from what I've seen in corporate America the next major recession we are going to see job reductions in IT similar to what happened to manufacturing jobs in 2008.

The only issue with this current process is that, I have exactly zero idea how other medium sized enterprises validate software.

So far this is the list i've come up with.\n  \n1. Is there existing software that can be used\n 2. Business need for software\n 3. Is this for a project\n 4. What is the impact if this software is not approved\n 5. What specific task will get done using this software.\n  \nSecondly, how do you know if the software is safe to introduce? Right now, here is what I do..\n  \nRun the software installer through our EDR sandbox\n Check if the installation is signed\n Try installing the software on a test box\n Googling the software / the hash\n  \nThe only issue with my current method is that a lot of times our engineers find these really niche tools from github etc that do extremely specific things.

Server has 2 NICs one NIC is working normally with 1 Gbps the other one is strange, at least for me. When I copy a file directly from the server to another workstation the speed is ok with 1 Gbps, but when I reach the Server from LAN the same workstation the copy speed is like limited to 200Mbps. Where should I look for the problem?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/brain5can  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is used in our Horizon environment, the UAG points to this for authentication. Since we have had various issues with this server, instead of upgrading the current server, I have been tasked with standing up a new Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server and setting this up with FreeRADIUS and Google Auth, then migrating over the configuration/database to avoid having to enroll all users with Google Auth again. I did some research but did not find too much information on how to easily migrate the Google Auth database to the new server. I found these two articles (Clone and Restore FreeRADIUS Setup and Sharing Google Auth Keys), but I wasn't sure that it would work.

          "description": "Hello all, recently purchased a refurb DL380 Gen9 with the NVMe enablement kit (part no 774741-B21 which consists of a PCIe NVMe controller, drive cage with backplane and 3 PCI express cables). I installed 6 x Kingston DC1500M drives (firmware version S67F0103, no newer available) and whilst they all work, I can only get PCI express Gen 3 link speed on port 1 & 2 of the controller. The other 4 drives (port 3, 4, 5 and 6) only operate at Gen 1 link speed.\n Output in lspci with correct speed (port 1 & 2):\n  LnkSta: Speed 8GT/s (ok), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- \n Output in lspci with slower speed (port 3, 4, 5, 6):\n  LnkSta: Speed 2.5GT/s (downgraded), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- \n Things I tried:\n  \nReset BIOS: no change. There are also no options to configure link speeds.\n Move drives around: no change. It doesn't matter which drive is connected where, port 1 & 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the other run at Gen 1\n Move cables around: no change\n Swap cable connections: connected port 1 & 2 to port 5 & 6 on the backplane. Still only port 1 & 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the the other run at Gen 1. That rules out a backplane problem\n Swapped NVMe controller: no change\n Connect only port 5 & 6: runs at Gen 3\n Firmware upgrade of NVMe controller: was already at latest version 1.78\n All other firmware is up to date\n  \nSo it looks like in whatever combination, I can only get 2 of the 6 drives to run at full Gen 3 speed whilst the other downgrade to Gen 1. There are some jumpers on the NVMe controller but I can't find any documentation on what they do and I doubt it's going to make a difference anway. Needless to say this quite kneecaps the performance of the NVMe drives... Anything else I can try?\n    submitted by    /u/RedShift9  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll try to explain it as best as I can.\n We are providing our users with Dell Latitute computers. At the moment we have anything from 7490 to 7430, and somewhere around 5320/7420 the problems started to arise.\n We issue our users with Jabra Evolve2 65 headsets so they can participate in Skype for Business meetings (we are not allowed to use Teams, don't ask...). It all seems to be working well, until after a week or two when the users who have been issued with a new computer comes back and complains that Skype is crashing when they use the headset. If they connect the USB dongle whatever sound settings you open (be it Skype or Windows), will freeze the program. \n I thought it was just a simple problem with Jabra, but after testing more thoroughly it turns out the problems are there for any USB sound dongle from any brand. We've tried updating the Realtek driver, and that works but only for a while once again, or just makes the Sound settings incredibly slow to navigate, not entirely frozen. Its also not universal which computers work decently with new drivers, and which will still not work.\n The problem is now big enough we can't decide on new headsets to buy, because we simply don't know if we can make them work. Are we the only ones with this issue, or has someone else found a solution to get us through this dongle hell hole?\n    submitted by    /u/FlaccidSWE  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, I the computer science teacher became the sysadmin of the school where I teach and I should get them in shape. Now Ubuntu and Windows 10 Pro are installed and every PC has one user with admin rights (yikes!). I would like to change this.\n I have a general idea and I know that I'm capable of hacking something together but I would like to do it in a proper way, e.g. in a way which probably requires me to put in more effort in the beginning but it should then spare me headaches in the future.\n My idea in general is the following: Students should learn how to (de)install apps, use said apps + MS Office + webbrowsing, get to know the OS-s (Windows 10 Pro and Ubuntu), learn the basics of fotoshop, do some programming in Python and execute them in the command line. On the other hand, it would be nice if let's say after midnight every PC would return to its original state which would prevent the students to do nasty stuff. The student would need to store everything in the cloud of on a USB-stick. The cherry on the pie would be the fact that the PC-s update themselves whenever needed. I'm thinking about maybe even creating a user for every student? But that seems a bit unnecessary, given that they can only access the PC-s in the school and not much else.\n Is there any software which already has this bundle?

There solutions might turn out to be frictionless and not that hard, but I cannot evaluate that based on my knowledge/experience.\n So, I see two ways to solve that problem:\n 1) Get into the PowerShell Scrips to automate parts of the progress\n 2) Search for a full featured migration tool that handles the work for me\n For the second point – of course it will be less effort, but my main concern on that topic is time.

No one's going to fix it without a nudge, or they might do something nutty like I've seen already and just make an interface with a 172.x.x.x IP on the firewall and NAT *Everything* through that.

I don't know if what I'm looking for is possible, hence maybe you guys can help me out. \n I have a private laptop (Dell Inspiron 7391 2-in-1) and a work Laptop (HP Elitebook). Both notebooks support thunderbolt. I have 1 monitor (Lenovo Thinkvision), 1 mouse, 1 keyboard, 1 headset and a external harddrive. \n  \nI am looking for a compatible docking station for both laptops and my periphery devices. Something I can just connect one laptop, and then pull out and connect the other laptop (one at a time). I have been looking at the Targus 190 and the Dell WD 19TBS. \n I was also wondering can you hook up a KVM switch to a docking station? So that you can just switch between the computers with a press of a button? If no, can you hook up a KVM switch to a monitor?

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n I got a question but I feel like I first have to explain the background a little bit: I have a customer with very specific requests. They need a system of 4 client and 2 server machines (will all be Windows 11 / Windows Server 2022) together with some additional network hardware (NAS, printers). The special thing is that this small network will run completely isolated and will not be connected to WAN or any other networks (for a fact I'm planning on physically plugging non used LAN ports on all devices). They need an AD running but only with generic users (Factory User, Storage User and so on) and no personal users. One of the servers will function as a Domain Controller. And They need that exact same system running on several different sites across the country. Like it has to be exactly the same, down to every single AD user.\n So since the the setup will be identical on all sites and not connected to the outside whatsoever, I had the idea to set this up in my lab one time, configure it to the customers likes and then just take images from every machine. If then the order for a site arrives, I could just use my specific images to prepare the machines. I've done it like that before but never with an AD involved, hence my questions. Oh and we use Symantec Ghost for imaging, if that matters. So here my questions:\n  \nCan you think of anything arguing against cloning AD machines, for example a Domain Controller?\n When I clone all machines after they are added to the AD and then restore these images on other machines, will they be added properly to the new site's AD (since the hostnames get cloned as well) or will this be spotty? I could join them to the AD manually for each site if need be, but it would increase the workload.\n Overall thoughts / input on my plan?\n  \nThanks in advance and have a nice week.\n    submitted by    /u/-sbl-  \n [link]   [comments]",

I will be likely implementing an MSSP in the next few months, but expect I will likely will want to supplement with my own logging platform for non-security related purposes. I don't want to have to change the configuration throughout my environment if I decide to add a second destination or change MSSPs. I would like to have a single point of aggregation and distribution for my logs. \n It appears using Windows Event Forwarder for my Windows systems and a syslog-ng system for everything else might work, but in both cases, it seems like there might be real-world issues as platforms may misinterpret the source for all events as being the two forwarders.\n Everything I find on this topic seems to be cover centralizing at one point, but nothing about then forwarding again.

The company has used PRTG for many years and there has never been a single app owner so it has accumulated a lot of garbage and there has been no standard ever put in place. This includes older servers using different SNMP strings, random WMI sensors, local users and groups in PRTG, etc. I am wanting to completely remodel our system and give it the attention it needs. I am also attempting to do this without too much monitoring downtime and effort. My question is though, how would other recommend setting up data center monitoring? Should I break it into folders like servers, networking, environmental. Then break it down into domain controllers, specific app, firewalls, switches, UPS, ATS, Genset, etc. Or should I break it down into different VLANs/Networks so I can use the auto discover feature?\n ​\n What is other peoples recommendations when administrating a tool like this?\n    submitted by    /u/ryguy6011  \n [link]   [comments]",

As in so hot they’ll burn your hand if you try to remove an SFP and hot enough to melt the labels on our fibers connected to them.\n We did note there is a vent on the top of the chassis but find it hard to believe this is related to cooling since the server is designed to be rack mounted on top of other servers without any spacing.\n This has caused some political issues with our site guys who are now insisting we space them out by 1RU which kinda defeats the purpose of purchasing a high density 1RU solution.

Earlier versions were a touch rocky to do major version upgrades on, but documentation was there, and I was able to get it sorted.\n Over the decade I've not only had performance improvements on the same hardware, but new features, and all sorts of great things.

I can take backups that don't get auto-pruned by my backup task! SO AWESOME!\n Also, Proxmox VE gave me an HTML5 local console to my VMs months/years before VMWare even had it, and Proxmox VE did it so much better (so much more responsive).\n And these are just some examples.\n So, I gotta say, fuckin'eh to the Proxmox VE devs!

          "description": "I'm looking for some level of understanding with Cisco Hyperflex. We will hopefully getting official training on it soon, but my team is being asked to take over a multi-site Hyperflex solution that was created by, well lets just call them non-IT people to be nice, and my first impression is that it wasn't built right. But they insist they followed all the Cisco recommendations. So I have some questions I'm hoping to figure out before I get called at 3am on a Saturday.\n First, the way these systems are configured is there is 6 VMware hosts, all with 6 SSDs in them, then the 7th server is the Hyperflex management server or something. Each server has a single NIC with 2 ports, 25Gbit, connected to two different switches. Those NICs are handling anything Hyperflex, VMware DRS, VMware Management, storage, and VM traffic itself. \n Questions:\n 1 - I've always gone with the school of thought that 1 single dual port NIC isn't very good for redundancy, but they insist this is the Cisco recommendation, are they really right?\n 2 - I also would never shove everything through those two nics, is this also Cisco's recommendation?\n 3 - The storage in VMware looks like iSCSI, but I haven't been able to get hands on. Where does the iSCSI adapters on the VMware host connect to as a SAN provider? Is it the management server? What happens when it crashes?\n 4 - Is the Hyperflex storage like VSAN where there is a replication delay? if so, how long is that delay?\n 5 - They told me DRS should be turned off for Hyperflex. Is that true? IF so, why?\n I guess open ended, is there any other tidbits of info you can supply me? Imagine that you are being asked to support a pair of these systems in different geographic locations, without ever seeing the damn thing ever.\n That's me\n    submitted by    /u/ntengineer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not a professional JIRA admin, but I do 1st and 2nd Level Support aside from my main tasks.\n The company paid around 6500 $ for the license for that app.\n By default, the app creates a database dump whenever you upgrade it.\n Cool, I thought. Upgraded it with few clicks. Closed the ticket – went on with my day thinking that it worked out fine. Nope. I received an E-Mail that the entire configuration from the users was gone.\n I looked into it and, yes, all the things that they were working on were gone. Communicated the situation to my other admin colleague and to the key users. Then I tried restoring the data from the database dump. This did not work because the database scheme has been upgraded as well, and we would have to revert the app to the older version to make the restore file compatible.\n So, I went into test environment, downloaded the older version of said app, installed it, but no. It did not downgrade. Apparently you'd have to uninstall the app first and then reinstall the older version. Sure thing, so I did just that (on the test environment) and tried to restore the backup there. Failed. Nothing happened when I click on the button to restore the data. And I also cannot restore the data on the test environment as the database dump only applies to the prod environment (due to the upgrade).\n Note that this is not the first time that this happened. We've had the same issue with this app around 1 month ago, where I created a ticket. Apparently it was a bug, which then got hotfixed. (We even tested it and it worked). But now we are back to where we've been in the beginning. I reopened the ticket, and I'm still waiting for feedback.\n Got a message that this issue has been perceived very negatively, and I understand. Now they want me to get the app working ASAP or I might get fired, but there's not much I can do.\n Yikes.\n    submitted by    /u/godsknowledge  \n [link]   [comments]",

The printer with v3 drivers are installing with their appropriate drivers.\n We have found that some of the V4 drivers are not installing, so adding that to the driver install script, removing and re-running the login mapping script, it still adds the printers with point and print. 2 of these are for the main office and need user preferences enabled so they can select trays etc. But point and print doesn't enable that. Without that we cannot shut off the old DCs.\n Now we don't want to disable the print nightmare registry key or amend it to a state where it is not 1 as this will be picked up in the cyber security audit in March 2023.

AppLocker is set to block anything to do with OneDrive, however it keeps getting reinstalled during every monthly patch. As far as I know, its not a requirement for any other apps and we have already been blocking it for a few month. \n What this ends up doing is making is users constantly see \"blocked by admin\" and error messages. This does not effect functionality but it causes an uproar from users.\n My suggested solution is to disable OneDrive usage via Group policy but actually \"allow OneDrive\" via AppLocker to prevent these messages. \n Is there anything Security/STIG related that makes my idea sound like a bad one?

(She really didn't want to put them on the network) This way at least i can look into the backups to see what has changed. But even that doesn't prove anything.\n What would you do so you could \"prove\" that either she changed something or at least see what changed and by whom ?\n This person can tie you up for hours and days complaining we don't do enough to find the culprit on her work pc and i don't know anymore what i could do to help her.\n ​\n Cheers,\n    submitted by    /u/_Aerish_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am wondering if there is also a 3rd party provider that can link to various identity providers to be the single source of identity so we can then point SSO/Saml config from the various saas provders instead of azure.\n A comment has been made, that they want to keep out tenant as clean as possible, eg only users with licenses and have access to company resources and equipment to reduce risk. This will likely be 300 users in next few years. But overall staff could be 5000+. Of the 5000+ , they wont have email acct, nor equipment but do need access to like HR Saas portals etc.\n Personally, I think its going to be cheaper to just give everyone a basic 365 license that inc some form of email and can control the MFA part of the identity provider. But business wants alternatives as they know as soon as I enable email, I will be going, headocount, headcount (not that I said I can turn the email part off).\n I am thinking like of Okta etc but wanted ot ask here first.\n    submitted by    /u/slewis_1972  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or am I over complicating things.\n I have created a complicated powershell script so far that does alot of prechecks (network,diskspace,homedrive space required, etc) but this actual lift and shift part just gets more complicated when I look into the nitty grity bits.\n    submitted by    /u/the_star_lord  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since i’m relying on Aruba to host my customer websites and email server (talking about imap/pop ofc), i would like to move to a vps to increase the income and to simplify my management work. I started looking at OVH but i need a “lot” of storage because my customers want a lot of GB per email address and on OVH to obtain more than 160gb i need to pay for the 8core/8gb ram vps that i don’t need (i can’t consider the option to add a secondary partition because cpanel can’t officially store email on another partition). So i started looking at A2Hosting, the “Lift 16 Vps” makes more sense for me since it has 450gb storage so i can fulfill the customer needings about email capacity. The exchange server is not a viable option due to costs. I would like to hear opinions about a2hosting, if someone has better ideas than mine and if cpanel has some sort of problems on multi-hosting that i didn’t consider.

Absolutely hate the things!\n In an environment where your place cannot ship goods without the printed labels, it is a bit of a showstopper!\n We use Zebra printers at site, quite a number of them, printing various labels from SAP, so they often have to be specific printers for each label type. These are types such as 110Xi4's, 220Xi4's, ZD500's and ZT610's. \n A long while back, I made some suggestions around purchasing maintenance for them but this cost and idea wasn't being entertained. So at the time, looked at purchase a spare of each printer type so in the event of failure, we can roll out a new printer immediately, minimising disruption and downtime. We went with this idea and knowing it could be months before replacement printer would arrive as lead times are about 3 months now. Obviously this was long ago now and spare is in use. \n So today, printer seems to have a mechanical fault, is out of warranty and Zebra don't really want to know. I'd sent them a video displaying fault and they now recognise it as being mechanical fault and needs a visit, but they ask me to contact a partner for this!\n Being the only IT guy about the place, this ultimately falls to me. I'm an IT guy yes, but I am not a printer engineer. We have our limits but it doesn't half stress me out when these things go down.\n It honestly felt as though I was doing same thing over and over again with the printer and expecting a different result.

And of recent I was put in a situation to meet up with a termed employee at our offices on a Saturday when no one is there. I have drawn the line here and documented my concerns in an email to HR and management. Thanks for the reassurance that I am making the right decision here stepping up to management.\n    submitted by    /u/j0nwayne  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was working on the server recently to install a TPM chip to have BitLocker setup and come to my surprise; I didn't see a RAID controller; and then I went into Disk Management and confirmed my suspicion. \n Disk 1: 500 GB: for OS\n Disk 2: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive\n Disk 3: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive\n Disk 4: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive\n Disk 5: 2TB Unused (Empty) \n https://imgur.com/a/Y46NSS7\n Server is PowerEdge R540 128 GB Memory / Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz \n Client has about 7 VMs being ran on this span of 3 hard drives. Fortunately all together the total amount of data being used is just a bit over 1 TB and we have Offsite backups running. Client doesn't know this yet. \n I want to look into getting a hard RAID Controller for the server and get RAID setup. Should I go for a RAID 5 and move the DATA off the D: Drive to the unused Disk on DISK 5? Or setup the server to do have a RAID 10 configuration for the DATA Drive?\n Also it bothers me that the OS is just sitting on a single drive with no redundancy as well. I was thinking of doing a RAID 1 for that.\n How would you go through and handle this issue and prevent as minimum downtime as possible to get this s*** fixed?\n    submitted by    /u/TeachRound  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Not too long ago, the email server market was spread across lots of different mail server products: Exchange (of course), Axigen, Ipswitch Imail, Kerio, Lotus Domino, MDaemon, Postfix, Neon Insight, Qmail, Sendmail, Smartermail, Sun Messaging server, Zimbra, Communigate, Mailenable and many others. Now, it seems, in the corporate space, due to the appeal of Microsoft's vast product suite, most companies have moved or will be moving to Microsoft 365. Question: Is this setup healthy? This might be exaggeration, but in years to come, since all data will be housed and managed by one company (Microsoft), will we even need the SMTP protocol?\n    submitted by    /u/poobear_74  \n [link]   [comments]",

We recently won a contract to distribute specialized network switches nationally but the catch is that we now directly take over the warranties and our current system is not suitable for the now large amount of RMAs we have to process and track. I have been asked to evaluate Snipe-IT as an alternative system before we spend a small fortune developing new Asset Management Software.\n I have played around with the demo and while It will easily address most of our needs the only way I can see us using it to track assets that have come back for an RMA is by creating a new status or duplicating a location and adding a suffix (example, having \"Location A\" and \"Location A-RMA area\"). However, due to their high volume, we want to treat the faulty switches as an entirely separate beast, in order to make end of month reporting easier.\n    submitted by    /u/Hugs_Happy  \n [link]   [comments]",

The backend is serving HTTP on 9801 but is also serving websockets on port 3000. A user visiting the site enters the domain https://foo.com, gets taken to the varnish box and views the site, where the site javascript then tells it to connect to websockets on wss://foo.tld:3000, but it can't connect. There are lots of solutions for setups where varnish is running on the same localhost as the backend that it's serving, but this one seems to be a problem. My VCL includes the standard req.http.upgrade -> return pipe with the connect headers copied, and it worked with our previous frontend proxy that was on a different CDN, and I suspect the old CDN was playing a part in making the websocket connections work.\n How do I get varnish to pick up the client connection for WSS on 3000 and pass it transparently back and forth to a remote backend that is running WS also on 3000?

Obviously it's an incredible offer, and I'm delighted to get it. My boss says that he wants to make me a similar offer, but it's going through the quagmire of the company HR department and nothing concrete has materialised after about a week. The new company needs to know by the end of this week whether I'm accepting.\n Not counting new job fear (in which I hope I'm not alone, and everyone here has from time to time!), the big thing for me is that company policy says I'd need to be in the office at least 2 days a week. I currently do the majority of drop offs and pick ups for my little girl (who's 3), which is possible due to my WFH schedule. The commute to the new job would be about 40 minutes each way, so days that I worked, I wouldn't be able to do the nursery run.\n My new prospective boss says that in his team, he's super open to being flexible with WFH, so it may not even be this much. I'm just.... Hesitant. I know that it's because of my WFH lifestyle that I'm used to - I guess I'm just wondering, how do I get over this fear? Have any of you made a similar transition?\n    submitted by    /u/OrdosDeluxe  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was my first truly oh shit moment. Took down the company for 3 hours. Today I got sometime to go back and start looking at the issue . The password for the krbtgt account has not been reset in about 8 years. When I run the klist command it shows AES-256 connection from and to every machine I have looked at. The only exceptions is the krbtgt and our QNAP device. QNAP will be something I look at afterwards. We have an old one and are talking about replacing it the first of the year so I don't want to spend too much time there. Anyhow, my thinking is it is still using RC4 because that was the last time the account had its password reset and to move it up to AES-256 the password needs to be reset. \n ​\n Can anyone confirm if my thinking is right?\n I've been told by multiple people that resetting the password for the krbtgt account has not caused any problems.

Then User2 comes in to start their day logs into a Windows 10 PC which is domain joined and receives \"Welcome User1\" in the windows login greeting and User1 is then disconnected from their RDS session and User2 has actually loaded User1's profile - desktop icons and all.\n Any ideas what may be causing this, I have tried the following:\n -Removed User1 and User2's profiles from the Windows 10 PC and then re-added only User2 back on to the device but the issue is still occurring - User 1 no longer uses the Windows 10 PC just works on the RDS.\n -Removed the Windows 10 PC from the domain and re-joined to the domain. The RDS server itself is new only a month or two old has been happening ever since the RDS server was setup I was informed.\n any further suggestions on what else we can try here? - getting close to the too much time wasted - blow away windows and reinstall and see if it happens again.\n    submitted by    /u/savijNizl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a self-serving post where I am patting my own back, but I don't care. I'm happy.\n We rate people on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest. Once a manager rates their employees, they need to justify the rating to senior management, who almost always challenge the rating, especially when it's a 4 or a 5. So, my manager is meeting with senior management and tells them he's giving me a 5, and they just say \"We're good with that. Who's next.\"\n After that, he tells me what an outstanding job I do. How my troubleshooting skills are god-tier, at times. How somehow I seem to be available 24x7, and on and on.\n Honestly, I don't think I am all that exceptional. I MIGHT spend 15-20 minutes after hours responding to emails from people. And I usually stay VPNed in till the VPN times out at 8:00 PM and kicks me off. If someone needs something done and it takes 5 minutes, I just go do it, because I am already VPNed in and I don't want to deal with it in the morning.\n So, in a month, I don't work that much overtime. But when I am sitting in bed and watching something on my iPad and I see an email pop up where someone is asking for something simple, I'll just reply and tell them I can deal with it in the morning.\n So, this really is the ILLUSION of putting in an insane amount of after hours work. When it's really just me responding to an email now and then. As an old boss told me: carry your Blackberry on you at all times (this was the 2000s). 99% of the time, you'll never be bothered. But that one time someone calls you and you answer, you're everyone's hero. And they'll remember you're the guy who answered the phone when there was a problem.\n It's good to be recognized sometimes.\n    submitted by    /u/plazman30  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even the \"Social Media\" catch all option is not blocking it in the Traffic Management section. \n Does anyone else have any experience or ideas on how to do this? The domains and IPs suggested online haven't been useful. I'm at the point where I will have to purchase additional software like openDNS, which is fine if that's what is necessary, but I was hoping to avoid.\n    submitted by    /u/Mikash33  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n tl;dr: How do you provide internet to multiple locations and have it tie into your main network?\n I want to preface by saying that I have very little networking experience. However, the facility I work for no longer has a network administrator so I'm trying to learn some more of how it's setup. \n Currently, there is one main location, and several satellite locations. From what I understand, the network comes in to the main building, and at some point is literally beamed over to 4 other locations. This is accomplished via emitters and receivers by Ubiquiti. As I've just found out, when one of those receivers goes down, Ubiquiti offers no support to help troubleshoot, or replace if needed. And replacing one involves climbing a long ladder with another ladder to reach the point that the receiver is on, mounting the equipment to the roof at a specific angle, and pointing it at the emitter at a precise point to receive the internet connection. All things that sound really specialized. \n In any case, previously I worked at a school district. There were 19 locations, and no Ubiquiti or something similar wireless emitters in sight. \n My question is, is something like this usually done by getting separate Internet connections configured, one for each building, and tying them into the main network? One of the Ubiquiti receivers is several miles away (so I've been told), I'm actually shocked it works at all. It seems like a really odd way to take care of something that seems mostly self explanatory... but I don't really know what I'm talking about.\n    submitted by    /u/Kiwihara  \n [link]   [comments]",

The PC retains the same IP address all day.\n Lease time is 4 hours, I'm told (can't confirm on my own PC, working from home right now).\n .\n My first thought is that the user closes the lid many times during the day, and the PC will negotiate a renew on the lease when it wakes again. However, my colleagues insist that the PC should retain its IP when going to sleep (not hibernate). My Google skills fall short when trying to confirm this.\n But even if the PC renegotiates every time - it would mean that the user closes their lid every 10 minutes or so during an entire day, and opens it immediately afterwards. This seems extremely unlikely.\n I've asked the DHCP guys at work about this, but they're out of office these days, so I'm trying here meanwhile.\n Does anyone have an input as to why the Logpoint logs show ~150 DHCP entries for a single PC during one work day (assuming normal user behaviour)?\n    submitted by    /u/TerjiD  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello!\n I work for an employer with a number of different sites. The organization's main office is moving from one location with multiple one-story buildings to a seven-story office building over the next year or two. Until now, our scheme for data has mostly followed 10.111.X.Y, with X being an arbitrary VLAN ID associated with a specific department and Y being the host. VoIP has typically mirrored that but with a VLAN ID equal to X + 100 (i.e. VLAN 50's voice VLAN is 150), and wireless has been a single VLAN across the entire organization. \n At our new building, we are tentatively planning on sticking with 10.111.X.Y, but with X being an arbitrary VLAN associated with the floor, not the department. The idea is to hopefully simplify management on our end since there will be multiple departments per floor but only one switch stack. We're planning on the same voice VLAN scheme. We're undecided on whether to do a single wireless subnet or one per floor. We're also considering adding another VLAN schema (like X + 200) for various maintenance devices on each floor of the new building, like cameras, HVAC equipment, etc.\n Does this all make sense? Is there a more efficient way of doing this? What's worked in your experience? We don't have too large a number of end users or devices, but we figure if there was ever a time to adjust our addressing it would be now. As a side note, what is standard practice for VPN pools? Right now we are using a completely random range (10.100.20.x). Would it make more sense to use something in the 10.111.x range? Thanks in advance for your thoughts!\n    submitted by    /u/nst_hopeful  \n [link]   [comments]",

Very expensive and we are a small shop with no experience with this technology.\n NAT6to4 seems easy enough to configure, but I worry about to scalability and robustness.\n We also have the option to lease additional /20 IP space for ~ 0.20c and IP per year with a 5 year term.

          "description": "I have an HP L3 switch connected to a Cisco L3 switch and am in the process of migrating SVIs. They are connected via 2x10G links in an LACP port-channel. This trunk carries a number of VLANs. There are devices hanging off of the Cisco switch with the HP core still handling the routing, and that all works fine.\n I created a test VLAN on each switch and added it to the trunk on both ends, with the intention of testing the SVI on the Cisco switch and only L2 on the HP side. I don't know if it's coincidence that this is happening with the test VLAN, but I can't get the test VLAN to pass any traffic across the trunk. Devices connected to the Cisco switch can talk to the SVI, but anything on the other side of the trunk can't connect. I've done variations of testing and essentially, any devices on that test VLAN can talk to each other unless they are physically located on the other side of the trunk. I've moved the SVI to the HP side and anything on HP side is now able to talk to the SVI and anything on Cisco can no longer talk to it.\n If I run a packet capture on a device from either side, it sends ARPs and gets no replies, furthering my suspicion that this is just a L2 trunk issue.\n I suspect there is some sort of bug with this VLAN not getting passed because I added it later than other VLANs. I plan to shut and no shut the port on the Cisco switch during a window. I have encountered something similar when using VTP in the past.\n Just wondering if I'm missing something - this seems fairly basic so I'm astounded it's causing such an issue.\n EDIT: No VTP in use. The Cisco switch is a pair of stacked 9500s, and the trunk port is cross-chassis etherchannel. \n    submitted by    /u/save_earth  \n [link]   [comments]",

Eventually, the new appliance would be doing all the work. At that point, remove the old appliance and plug the new one directly into the ISP's modem. \n Is there a more common way to work through this scenario? Are there any gotchas?

          "description": "Hello. Would love thoughts/opinions on the best devices or type of devices or service. I have recently started at a small but growing enterprise. Company has 4 locations in the US and 3 in Asia. 3 locations have 200-300 users each and the rest are tiny. One of the larger sites hosts a single public facing application, accessed by our partners, nothing else is hosted publicly in the enterprise services (with the exception of client VPN). The rest have users mostly accessing Office 365, other SaaS applications and a smattering of internal applications. So far the long term goals of the company are:\n  \nTo ideally consolidate all sites on a single platform - not a hard requirement if something else makes sense but right now it's a hodge podge and current gear is up for renewal and/or end of life. Everything is basic firewalls right now, no NGFW/UTM/SWG etc.\n To implement a greater degree of filtering/inspection/prevention/reporting and to ultimately integrate with an EDR/XDR platform for better visibility.\n To ideally eliminate our MPLS in favor of an SD-WAN, with redundant ISP's in each location\n To move all server workloads, including the single public facing app, to public cloud\n  \nThe security vendor who my boss (CIO) has a relationship with is pushing him to buy their EDR/XDR platform along with their UTM's in every location. This is running a pretty high price tag and causing him to think about whether he can afford two for every location to have redundancy/fail over. I have a good networking foundation but my background is more on the server and storage side. At this point I am thinking that these UTM's at each location may be overkill for users surfing the internet. I am thinking there might be better/more cost effective alternatives. Or whether a hosted solution like zScaler or a competitor would be more cost effective. Ideally whatever solution we choose should have some way to integrate with an XDR platform.\n WWYD?\n thanks\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/moneydontjiggle4sure  \n [link]   [comments]",

It acts like a firewall issue, but I've tried many things that make me believe it's more of a fundamental limitation of QEMU/Libvirt/virbr0.\n I've have created several tunnels with Strongswan, but this roadblock has me stumped.\n Has anyone successfully created an IPSEC tunnel with KVM host using strongswan and the default virbr0 network? I'd like to have my VMs reachable over the IPSEC tunnel and also allow the VMs to reach my local LAN.\n I can reach the VMs without issue, but I can't connect from the VM to my local LAN. I noticed the issue when trying to connect two KVM hypervisors over the internet with Strongswan IPSEC. I've been running Strongswan to connect to my VMs in the cloud for over a year, but never realized the tunnel really doesn't work in the other direction (other than ping/ICMP works).\n The basic oddity is like this: I can ping a remote LAN host over the tunnel, but if I run traceroute, it tries to go to the public interface first, which leads me to believe it's a limitation of virbr0.\n If anyone would like to help, here are my iptables on the kvm host.\n Local LAN = 192.168.7.0.24\n Remote virbr0/KVM LAN = 192.168.222.0/24\n Here's the strongswan config.\n I think the workaround is to create a tunnel using Wireguard, but I hate being defeated and would really like to learn what I'm doing wrong or not understanding.\n Thanks in advance to anyone willing to contribute.\n    submitted by    /u/voltswagner  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sorry if this doesn't fit here.\n The issue I've been having, is that from a oracle cloud ampere server (with a 4 Gbps link) located about 1200 km away, with 34 ms of latency, I cannot seem to get more than about 100 Mbps to my local connection. \n I have tested it using iperf3, and even if I tinker with the settings to adjust threads it will not get any more than 100 Mbps. I have changed the mtu on both machines, changed the max tcp window size, and tried to change the hardware settings for nics on both of the machines. When I run a udp iperf3 test, I can reach the maximum speed my connection allows (1 Gbps).\n The reason why I believe more bandwidth should be possible is that when I use a wireguard vpn, I can reach tcp speeds through that connection to the server, above 600 mbps. Also, a speedtest from the server to a local speedtest server is about 1500 Mbps, and my connection to that same speedtest is at 1000 Mbps.\n I am not sure if this is just bad routing, or bandwidth delay product.

I am seeing in a Wireshark capture multiple other connections going through the same edge FWs are negotiating at TLS v1.2 and are successful. But only this one is negotiating by default as TLS v1.0 by the client and then getting a reset (since we reject v1.0 and 1.1). I have tried forcing TLS v1.2 at the browser level on the client and it still negotiates at v1.0.\n The only thing I haven't tried (since I don't have admin access to the VDI machines) is doing the windows OS-level registry change for removing TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1\n Any suggestions?\n    submitted by    /u/Xibbas  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, I'm looking to learn more about colocation and networking in the data center environment. Essentially, I have a few servers that I want to put into a rack in a data center but I'm tossed up on what direction I should start with.\n The first topic is the choice of networking equipment. The data center provides a 1 Gbps SFP connection. Now, I could plug that directly into a switch and have a server in the rack that handles DHCP, but are there any good cheap switches that have a DHCP server built in that also allows for easy remote management? \n The first setup I was looking at using was a Ubiquiti Dream Machine SE and a Ubiquti Pro switch. I would plug the SFP from the data center into the Dream Machine, then another SFP from the Dream Machine into the Pro Switch. Ubiquiti was a choice due to the familiarity of knowing how to manage the settings on both devices.\n The second setup was looking into Cisco Meraki devices, however, I'm not familiar with Cisco's product lineup. I do have my CompTIA A+ and Network+, so I am somewhat familiar with using the CLI, but the program I was in only had us focus on managing Cisco devices on a LAN through the CLI only. I was scrolling through threads on WHT and several times Cisco Meraki devices came up. Does anyone know if Cisco Meraki devices have a built in DHCP server? If not, then I would still need to have a DHCP server setup in the rack.\n Also, does anyone have any recommendations on material that I can use to help better understand networking concepts and practices in the data center regarding how to setup and manage BGP, how to assign IPv4 subnets to specific devices, or personal advice with first time colocation experiences?\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/fallen0523  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not a networking person, more of a SysAdmin, so I admittedly don't know a ton about networking equipment.\n During the cutover, one of the corporate IT network guys said there were a bunch of CRC errors on one piece of network equipment or another, and that this was causing really bad slowness. We were then instructed to replace any fiber cables shorter than 2 meters with longer ones. We had a number of 1M cables in place. Apparently (I didn't see for myself) the errors went away after this was done.

Just recently got a new job, doing some higher level infrastructure for a company of 1600 people and 60 locations, with an IT team of 4 (me being the networking guy). I’m just starting to really grasp tunnels, VLANs and trunking concepts in a large company. I’m currently doing network discovery for these locations as they dropped their MSP last month. I worked for a msp previously but we generally supported smaller offices with pretty basic networks without switches, subnets, and VLANs. They use several VLANs across the network at my new job. They’re using fortigates and dell switches primarily. I’m trying to familiar myself with these concepts to help understand the network more.\n Now looking at the static routes on the fortigate firewalls I can see and understand how VLANs and different subnets are communicating. My question is, do you need to setup static routes on a switch with VLANs as well? I’m thinking they would have similar static routes, explaining what IP schemes can communicate over a L3 switch? Or am I overthinking this?\n Thanks for any advice! We’re a small team and sometimes I feel like I have nobody to lean on for questions like this.\n    submitted by    /u/Tatu2  \n [link]   [comments]",

This switch has dhcp helper information for each vlan\n Now, the oddities:\n -I can't find any other dhcp server on our network of any kind, in any of the vlans\n -Only certain wired vlans are affected; the data vlans for end user PC's. Our wireless, phone, security camera, clock and management vlans are unaffected.\n -We don't exhaust the pool; we will get a random number of bad address entries, usually about a third of the amount of wired desktop PC's\n -I have set the DHCP lease time to 6 hours, which results in much fewer bad address entries. If I bump it up to 2-3 days or more, I will have double or triple the amount of entries.\n ​\n I'm suspecting it might be some of our Dell desktops (optiplex 3060, Win 10 and 11 Enterprise for clients) that is the issue; in the 5 vlans affected, all of the desktops are the same model Dell.

Also sorry for the wall of text. There will be a TL;DR at the end, but I hope the context is important. \n On Monday my business had some sort of power event that caused our firewall, main switch (hp-2510-48), phone system and one of our active directory/dns servers to power cycle before coming back online. After that in a seemingly random pattern, various end point devices can no longer connect to the network, and for those devices that can, the network latency is through the roof. Before, on average packet loss would be maybe 1/100 if we were looking, now it is 40-60% packet loss. \n Our initial investigation showed that plugging directly into …",

          "description": "Hi r/networking, \n I'm relatively new to networking and have a weird circumstance that I'm not sure how to tackle. \n I connect manufacturing equipment to our client's WAN on a regular basis. Our manufacturing equipement has an internal LAN with the IP scheme, 192.168.100.XXX, and I use a router to NAT to static IPs on our client's network that they provide. \n It's usually smooth sailing, I configure the router to the dedicated IPs the client provides and we're good to go. \n My trouble is my client's WAN is 192.168.100.XXX as well. So NATing would be pointless and I cannot reserve all of IPs of my machine on their network. \n Would there be a good way to not create conflict? My initial thought is to use a VLAN so my equipment's LAN sees the VLAN and their WAN sees the VLAN and neither ever sees each other, I don't actually know if this is possible or the best course of action. Any guidance is much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/njbruggeman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been trying to spoof the #1 and 2 IPs. So that the messages goes from #1 to (ME #4) then to the #2 Multi then #4.\n It doesn't really matter the order as long as I can see a loss, delay effect on either end of the network.\n ​\n  \nWhat I need:\n  \nI need a way to intercept and control the flow of these packets. I need to represent a loss of packets, and delay the time which the packets send at.\n ​\n  \nThings I have tried:\n  \nI have been using Ettercap and TC Qdisc to try and make this work. I can receive the packets with Ettercap, but when I try and use TC Qdisc it doesn't have any effect.\n I originally tested just going from IP1 to IP2 and used Ettercap to spoof these ips. I then used TC Qdisc to control the loss packets, delay, duplicate, and corruption of these packets and it Does work.\n ​\n In my original test without multicast you would see this on wireshark:\n 192.168.1.1 >> 192.168.1.15\n 192.168.1.15 >> 192.168.1.1\n ​\n With multicast you would see this on wireshark:\n 192.168.1.1 >> 235.1.200.1\n 192.168.1.15 >> 235.1.200.1\n I tired getting between the host and multi and tried applying the effects there but no luck. \n 192.168.1.15 >> (ME TC QDISC HOST) >> 235.1.200.1\n ​\n  \nQuestion to you:\n  \nWhat are my options here.

I'm currently doing discovery on this building, but I have no GUI/Web interface to log into for two of the three stacks.\n The MDF has no issues. I'm able to log into that via IP address no problem.\n I'm having issues getting into the other IDF stacks. I'm able to putty into them using SSH no problem. Credentials take which is a great sign.

          "description": "I seem to be getting conflicting information on how the IPsec protocol itself handles multiple subnets in a tunnel. I know different vendors have slightly different approaches to this, but I'm more concerned with what's actually possible in the protocol. I've heard the following so far:\n  \nMultiple subnets are agreed upon in phase 2, all in a single tunnel.\n Multiple phase 2 \"tunnels\" are created, one for each subnet pair.\n You can't do more than one subnet pair in the IPsec protocol. Therefore, multiple phase 1 tunnels are created, one for each subnet pair.\n  \nI think the 2nd answer is correct, but I can't seem to find any detailed information from an authority on it without diving deep into the RFC's.\n FWIW, I know it's possible to just make a big 0.0.0.0/0 tunnel and deal with the routing myself, but I'm trying to help a vendor troubleshoot their own stuff on a failover tunnel between us and them. The status on my side shows that in a failover event, only one of the subnet pairs is re-created.\n Edit: I'm now leaning towards the 1st answer because of the below link. It seems that you can have multiple traffic selectors. Some vendors just \"show\" this information as multiple phase 2 tunnels? But their terminology isn't necessarily accurate, and everything was only negotiated once in phase 2?\n https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/vpns/site-to-site-vpn-concepts/ikev2/traffic-selectors\n    submitted by    /u/j0mbie  \n [link]   [comments]",

Their old one was basically an allow all rule that configures the firewall like a router. I've told them multiple times this is not acceptable. \n Long story short I configured the firewall for them, but it did cause some things to break. (I don't actually work in their environment so its hard for me to know everything that goes on) \n Their environment is somewhat complex as they have multiple vpns belonging to clients. Also obviously clients don't give out all the security details of their programs so its been tough sledding to this point.\n My question is is what would you do if you were in my shoes? Is it not possible to block a lot of ports due to the size of the company? I've only worked at smaller companies so blocking multiple ports has never been an issue.\n I've read about doing network scans for 24 hours and then analyzing this data.

As a startup, we are essentially all \"floating\" right now --- we don't have a dedicated office with a dedicated network range, or any sort of on-premise presence.\n But, we need a way to access EC2, RDS, etc. without public IP addresses (and preferably without a publicly exposed bastion/jumpbox to get there). We don't have anything massively critical, and we will grow, so by the time we do, we can revisit this to really flesh out a sturdy solution. But right now I just need some basic items I can go through to ensure only our people can access our AWS resources.\n For VPN options that aren't site-to-site, \"Client VPN\" seems like an option: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/introducing-aws-client-vpn-to-securely-access-aws-and-on-premises-resources/\n If someone can just tell me if I'm warm or cold on this, and point me in the direction of the necessary service/tool that I need, that would be great.

The error is the same regardless of if I use any other iosxr method like for banners or logging which is why I tried switching to iosxr_command to rule out any weirdness but it's still there and only when pushing to the NCS540.\n I'm using network_cli for the connection and iosxr for the network_os in the group_vars vars file for this platform, same as the ASR.\n ​\n Any ideas?

The ISPs have 2 /30s and we are advertises out a /24. Does it make sense to have the switches handle the BGP or is it more common practice to have a device dedicated to that and the switches handle things like vxlan/spine leaf topology. \n \nHow do firewalls get implemented?

We have a Direct Connect connection from both of our DC's to AWS.\n ~2,800 of these sites use LTE and are on a private APN, they route to our 2 datacenters via MPLS circuits from our Telco. The speed at these sites averages between 15-20Mps.\n The remaining 700 or so sites use Internet, and route to our 2 datacenters via a pair of Internet circuits from different vendors. The speed at these sites is anywhere from 3Mbps (Satellite) up to 100+Mbps (Cable)\n Now to my question, I want to make sure our MPLS and Internet circuits (and AWS Direct Connect circuits) are scaled accordingly to support all of these downloads in this window. We want to make sure the downloads happen fairly quick (say less than say 10 minutes per device).\n Does anyone know of an online calulator that would help me do the math?\n I definitely plan on contacting our Telco to get their input, but I want to have some numbers (at least rough numbers) before engaging them to make sure they're not making shit up.\n As you can imagine this is a very large and very important implementation (we're on year 3 of the project) for my company and I want my portion (the network) to go as smoothly as possible.\n Any input would be muchly appreciated!\n ​\n MtM\n    submitted by    /u/mcdeath_the_mad  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "About a month ago, I cut over from a sonicwall to a watchguard firewall for a customer. One of the interfaces is an uplink to a meraki router. Apparently the sonicwall had DHCP configured for this interface but I didn’t catch that when configuring the new firewall. So the cutover happens and all appears to be working fine in the environment. Until today. The customer lost power last night and thats when the meraki router was no longer reachable. I spent an hour on the phone with the vendor who manages the meraki troubleshooting what could be the issue. I was out of ideas until they mentioned that they are configured for DHCP and that’s when I realized I never set up a DHCP sever for the interface (because when do routers use DHCP? Is this standard practice or something now?) Anyways, I configured a small address pool and the router came back online. I’m just surprised that the router maintained its lease from the previous firewall for as long as it did. At least I’m assuming that’s how it was still able to function.

They currently have a:\n Corporate Network (which I would like the VPN to be able to access) (10.*.*.*)\n VPN IP Range (172.1.*.*)\n Seperate Gateway VLAN (172.2.*.*) for servers they can access - these servers have an IP in both corporate and seperate VLAN, with gateway only entered on the seperate VLAN. This VLAN also has its own DNS which is what VPN clients are currently pointed to and provides the gateway VLAN ip address for these servers\n Issue is that people feel restricted, cant access file shares as if they were in work etc., have to remote on to an RDP server and productivity is suffering. My thoughts are that if the VPN is secure and has MFA in place, they can be considered secure enough to access all (or rather most - some is still locked behind other VLANs) corporate resources and work exactly as if they were in the office.\n So, to the issue - \n  \nI have put a rule in place on the firewall to allow fully authenticated users access to the corporate VLAN.\n \nI have updated the DNS on my computer to the corporate DNS. With this in place DNS works and I can ping ALL servers on the corporate VLAN except those with an IP address in both networks.\n \nPinging the other servers on their Gateway IP address works\n DNS gets the correct IP but I cant ping these on the corporate IP range.\n \n I suspect this is a routing and / or firewall issue but any pointers on where I should be looking would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Automatic-Ad7994  \n [link]   [comments]",

My test is downloading 46GB of data spread out over about 40k files, done by about 4k instances of the downloader process (this is done in a build system, so each instance of the downloader is run/cached separately,). This works out to an average of 10 files downloaded per httpclient instance and an.average of 1MB per file.\n Everything works fine until minute 4, when suddenly my download speed goes to 0. I have a timeout of 1 minute on the process and 5 attempts are made to download each file. About 2 minutes after the stalled downloads, it starts back up again. This is after the first two attempts timed out. The server logs show that it didn't even seem to receive the request that was being asked of it, and when it did receive a request, the server claims it handled it quickly.\n So far to troubleshoote I have tried to increase the dynamic port range, and limit the number of requests being sent at once to 75. Still this happens pretty deterministically around the 3-5 minute mark.\n Is there something I can check and try to figure out why it is stalling?

I have a big goal to eventually set up a mechanism to redirect past due clients to a \"Hey, pay your bill\" web page.\n Originally, I was trying to make this a function of DHCP with classes for user MACs that are active or suspended. Active clients will be given an IP on a subnet that is allowed out via NAT permit policy, wheras suspended MACs would be placed on a subnet not allowed out to the internet and has all DNS queries pointing to the IP of my web server (via bind9 views one using normal DNS forwarding and the other pointing to a local dnsmasq instance) with rewrite rules to my \"pay your bill\" page.\n This ALMOST worked, but when you have multiple IPs on one VLAN, one IP must be the primary IP and that put a halt to anything working. This was because the relay agent will always use the primary IP for the relay agent IP to determine which pool to grant an IP from. I can get a device from active to suspended if the suspended IP is the default, but it will not go back since the relay agent IP will always be the primary IP on the VLAN.\n This led me to consider RADIUS, since you can use Framed-IP-Address to reassign an IP.\n I have a working baseline FreeRADIUS server set up that accepts usernames, passwords and secrets and correctly responds. It is backed by MySQL. I can figure out mac-auth and the rest but I need to know how to make the HAPs authenticate themselves once they get on the network.\n The imagined flow would be DHCP on the primary (suspended) subnet. Radius processes if the MAC is active or not. If it is not it will stay on the suspended subnet. If the MAC is active RADIUS will provide an IP on the secondary (active) subnet.\n Is there a way to make what I am aiming for work?\n    submitted by    /u/SciensSciencia  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems it was an after thought as there has to be a local XML on every endpoint in order for the first connection to be made (after the first connection, the endpoint pulls the XML from the firewall)\n We don't think we can do this because of the mobile IoT devices that our company VPNs with. We also have some site to sites that are causing us to make VTIs and our company just keeps growing it seems and the firewalls are getting more complex with that.

Can the device behave as a standard client on the B interface (including receiving a DHCP address) but still allow AWS traffic to access devices on the network without being the default gateway for that network?

So far passing files from one to another is done using usb drives. I was thinking of connecting the PC with the internet to one of the PCs in the offline network and use a simple ftp server using Python scripts to automate this process. \n Now the question is, will that beat the purpose of the \"offline\" lan network security? Is there any standard way of keeping the Internet and the lan network fully seperate, like transfer the files ONLY through the python script and keep the lan network invisible from the Internet.

          "description": "I'm relatively certain I know the answer on this one, but wanted to get some outside confirmation - a type 2 route redistribution into OSPF will have a flat metric throughout the OSPF topology (1 if redistributing from BGP, 20 if redistributing from anything else, at least for Cisco's implementation). \n In contrast, for type 1 routes, the router doing the redistribution into OSPF doesn't try to add any cost based on the protocol it's being redistributed from. Say router XYZ is redistributing a static route to 5.5.5.0/24 as a type 1 route. Would it be correct to say that other OSPF routers in the topology calculate the metric for 5.5.5.0/24 based on their cost to reach router XYZ, and that router XYZ's perceived metric to reach 5.5.5.0/24 doesn't matter (static routes seem to have a \"metric\" in show ip route of 0 anyway)? If you had your reference bandwidth set to 10g, it wouldn't matter if the static route to 5.5.5.0/24 had a next-hop address associated with an interface running at 10g, 1g, or 100m; the OSPF topology is only considering the cost to reach router XYZ, and router XYZ won't try to artificially inflate the OSPF cost if the bandwidth on that interface changes.\n    submitted by    /u/AlmavivaConte  \n [link]   [comments]",

I get the security aspect and how it does more to authenticate users and devices than just saying \"Oh you're on the domain? You're good.\" However, it seems to be purely security. I don't see how it actually connects you to the network?

Topology is here: https://ibb.co/myN4xXn\n I did not design this network, I inherited it. My knowledge of BGP is shallow but I used it successfully in many simple networks.\n Site 2 uses Site 1's ExpressRoute to reach Azure when MPLS and Site 1's ExpressRoute are available. When not site 2 uses direct site to site VPN tunnel to reach Azure. Failover and failback work correctly when MPLS fails, but I am running into issues when ExpressRoute fails. When ExpressRoute fails Site 1 still advertises routes to Site 2 because it learns them through Site 1's site to site VPN. I don't want that.\n Site 2 uses weight to prioritize \"MPLS\" over Site to Site VPN to Azure. In Azure I am pre-pending AS to make one path less desirable.\n What I simply want to do is prevent Site 1 from advertising Azure routes to site 2 when they are learned through Site to Site VPN, but for some reason I can't wrap my head on how to do that. I know I need to use a route-maps to do it, but how to configure the route map and where to apply it is the question.\n Conceptually I think I need to first tag/identify routes when they are learned through site to site VPN Azure BGP neighbor, and then I need to deny those routes from being advertised to site 2.\n Right now I am using same route-map on site 1 for both Azure BGP neighbors. I think I will need to split that and use different route-map for each neighbor. \n It seems that I can use \"community\", \"origin\", \"tag\", and \"route-tag\" to make routes from one neighbor different than others.\n On premise equipment are FortiGate firewalls and ideally I like to make all changes on them. I want to avoid, if possible, to make changes in Azure.\n    submitted by    /u/interweb_gangsta  \n [link]   [comments]",

We did get 2 last year and loaded with speedtest cli. We distributed these to two buildings and it works flawlessly. Getting old laptops or old pc’s running in attics would work but I’m looking for something small like a raspberry that I can plug into a switch in an attic get my stats and dump them into g drive.

I'm thinking about 'layering' functions like e.g. a geographical topology where I might open up a location, where I might choose between e.g. physical, L2 or L3 topologies pr. location, etc. A cascading system, if you will, where only the wished for information is displayed at a time.\n Hope the question makes sense!\n    submitted by    /u/TerjiD  \n [link]   [comments]",

So there is no way for me to re-route traffic to reach the new solution.\n All of the clients/servers on the webhosting side have their gateways pointed to the current interfaces on our web hosting ASA's (not on a BD in ACI). So these gateways would need to point to the new solution to. The new solution will have the same interfaces, ip's in the same networks etc... but will be different ip's. \n I need to find a way to avoid a big bang approach of just flicking over the all the servers gateways to the new firewalls with the migrated rule sets on and hoping for the best.

We are setting up a separate location using Comcast P2P. All the things at this location would need to talk to servers on a mix of VLANS. Eventually, we want to route everything but one of my questions is does it have to be done all at once? Our initial thought is to start with this location and then move on to everything else. \n Doing some research, I believe the most future-proof routing protocol would be OSPFv2 (correct me if I'm wrong). Is it going to be a huge headache to connect a 10.0.0.0 to a 192.168.0.0 network? Currently, everything is on 192.168. The biggest reason we want to move to layer 3 is that we have a data center connected to the main location via 2 dark fibers and 1 P2P fiber. Currently, they are separated from each other and the P2P is on a disabled port only to be enabled when the other 2 are down. The 2 dark fibers are redundant but we want to connect that 3rd one to the other 2 dark fibers. We either can't do that or can't figure out how to do that because the 2 dark fibers are 10g and the P2P is 1g.\n Is it feasible to move to layer 3? We have roughly 350 PCs, 100 printers, ~400 phones, 35 switches, and ~100 servers and I'm sure I'm missing more.

What I mean by interactive is, that you can hover over a country or location and see the most important information as well as being able to \"drill down\" by double clicking it.\n I know it is a lot, but and I tried several solutions over the years and found not a single one to create such a \"diagram\"\n - Visio - Great for detailed Branch Network documentations, but not intereactive\n - Miro - Interactive and easy to use for \"quick and dirty\" schematics\n - draw.io - same as Miro\n - powerpoint - Interactive but not really meant for network diagrams\n - lucidcharts - same as visio\n - NetBrain - expensive, kinda hard to master and not \"easy to use\"\n - Any other SDN tool (solarwinds, n-map, ...) same as netbrain\n - even tried some tools for scientific network maps - They basically do what I need but just to a certain degree\n - .....\n As you might notice I've tried a lot and might even have missed some things i tested in the past.\n Maybe one of you big brains out there has something in mind or created something similar in the past.\n I am looking forward for any tips, hints and suggestions :)\n    submitted by    /u/HighlightEven1406  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do I need a tac case for cisco to apply the 3 license I need (security k9 and app-k9) or is there a command I can enter to get these registered on my own?\n If I do a sho ver I show it does have Foudationsuitek9, securityk9\n    submitted by    /u/Accomplished_Bed7023  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a routed network, but these devices must have transparent layer 2 connectivity between them?\n If I have a Cisco 3850, Cisco 9300, and a Cisco 3650 in a triangle of routing, can I use a technology, such as VXLAN to span a VLAN across these? Do these platforms support this?\n What if I have a more complex network? Does each switch in the routing path need to be VXLAN supporting, or only the ingress/egress switches?\n Is there a performance consideration doing this, or should the switches be able to handle this traffic at or near line-speed?\n Is there a better way? I have no experience on VXLAN, outside of reading about it.\n ​\n There are two use-cases for this. One is for the above diagram, where I have a special system that must have layer two connectivity. Furthermore, if this works, there will be more than two endpoints, and I would need to provide a common Layer 2 spanning several locations. The bandwidth requirements are low. <10Mbps\n The second use case is to create a form of hyper segmentation, for security. I'd like to be able to span several VLANs out to certain sites for IOT, guest access, surveillance cameras, etc. All running back to a central firewall, or series of ACLs would control access between the segments.

The switch currently says it is delivering 3-4W PoE to all cameras, but the port lights only turn on for 1-2. In all cases, neither IP or link-layer pings can reach them.\n The switch is also delivering PoE to two Wifi APs and an unmanaged PoE-in 5-port switch. These three things have continued to function fine, with the Wifi APs being online even longer than the cameras.\n Also, the cables have been tested and verified. They are shielded CAT6 with solid 23 AWG copper wire. Should hold up just fine.\n Back to the cameras, I can't seem to get the online. There are 4 different models, all from Reolink, and only the oldest one (out of support) lights up a network port. I've also tried them on a ProCurve 2520-8 (J9137A), and it's the nearly the same problem, except that one old camera gets CRC/alignment errors showing up in the switch logs for it's port. Doesn't matter which port I connect it to.\n The only explanation I can think of, and it doesn't make complete sense to me, is that somehow a power outage bricked the PoE Reolink cameras, but not the other PoE devices, and not the PoE switch itself.

I have successfully set up OPNSense, a Brocade 6450, and a Ruckus r710 running the latest Unleashed firmware. My main SSID is set up on the AP and is running perfectly fine. My issue is when I got to setup a second SSID for IoT on my r710. \n Similar to PFSense, I have configured my router with a Vlan, different subnet of 10.0.10.0/24, DHCP server, etc.... The vlan is tagged as 10 on OPNSense. I have done the same on the R710.... I created a guest network, under WLAN set the VLAN to 10. \n Then on the brocade, I created a vlan and set the port 48 to dual mode so that the tagged vlan 10 and the untagged traffic should be able to flow, but that hasn't worked. I even tried to assign the subnet IP to the tagged vlan 10 with no change. \n The only thing that has worked so far somewhat is when I set the Vlan tag to 1 in the Guest SSID on the ruckus, but that similar then routes traffic through the untagged rule on the switch which does not achieve the true separation I want for my Vlan. \n What am I missing here? Any help or direction would be helpful! I have been reading documentation for several hours now, but I am no where closer to solving my problem. Am I missing something simple or am I WAY off base on my understanding of how things needs to flow? Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/Aurum115  \n [link]   [comments]",

My question is when radio waves are sent from the antenna of my wireless device to the router, how is the binary interpreted in the right order or reconstructed into the right order?\n My understanding is that the radio waves can reach the router out of order due to multi propagation where radio waves can take different paths of different lengths due to reflecting off of objects (which are potentially moving). \n Also, can someone confirm my understanding is right that only a single device communicates with an access point at a time because of CDMA/CA. This allows the access point to know which device is sending it signals right? I realize in the newer 802.11 ax, it can split a channel into subsections and interpret signals from multiple devices at the same time so does it need CDMA/CA?\n Thanks for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/infinity123248  \n [link]   [comments]",

The APs and switches won’t arrive for long and I need to fix internet ASAP. It’s super bad. Some areas aren’t covered at all. Even cable internet keeps disconnecting. \n Fortigate is in stock and available. I can start requisitioning them and fixing office network. \n I do not have ANY experience with Forti and I do not want to make a rushed decision because of time constraints. \n Can any of you tell me what your experience with Fortigate has been?

I've seen a few posts suggesting that Nexus 9K devices should be used to replace the 6509's, there is also a colleague who suggests the same. I was thinking today (when working on a couple of Nexus devices), that they are a bit overkill just for a site? Especially when most of our access switches are still 3560 era.\n ​\n I really do not have much Nexus experience, so I am genuinely interested in what people think and the advantages/disadvantages of them. \n A colleague and I were speaking today that replacing a C6509 at a site with 2 x Nexus switches in a VPC seems overkill. Especially when there are a maximum of 15 access switches (this is our largest site, some only have 5/6 access switches). We both agreed that a 2/3 stacked 48 port C9300's or equivalent could be a good replacement on the 6509's going forward. They have 10G access and uplink ports and the pair of us agreed that they're easier to set up in terms of HSRP (stacking them will do it). We are also curious to understand the benefits of VPC over standard port-channeling.\n ​\n Sorry for my ignorance on this one, but as I mentioned my Nexus knowledge is poor!\n ​\n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Pleasekin  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have had a dev come to us - asking for access to pcap driver for sniffing traffic to locate certain devices.\n My initial reaction to this was a hard no - as I was always taught this was a very bad thing to do. With the risk of intercepting unencrypted data such as passwords etc.\n In today's world - would you consider this as much of a risk? My personal thoughts are:\n  \nL2 boundaries (such as VLAN with SVI) will limit what can be easily sniffed.\n plaintext data is a risk no matter what (should be wrapped or encryption).\n purely talking about sniffing of packets, not any other related attacks, the risks are minimal if everything is encrypted?\n  \nedit: I should mention my recommendation was for scanning the ip-ranges instead (as this would also allow for situations where devices are in another l3 network).

I’ve worked at a MSP for about 2 years and for the last 5 years I’ve worked for school district where I’m the lone systems and network administrator. I’m fully in charge of maintaining and upgrading about 100 switches and 400 access points, mix of Meraki and Cisco across 11 sites. About 5000 users in total. For the network end I’ve implemented and swapped out access layer switches, implemented a basic single area OSPF, setup vlans/port security/BYOD network/etc., maintain a wireless network and troubleshoot various problems that come up. \n As for the systems side of it. I’m also in charge of managing and upgrading servers. I’ve done multiple domain controller upgrades, file server migrations, NPS servers, DHCP, Print, Hyper-V upgrades/deployments, Image creation from Windows 7 to Windows 11. \n I’ve also been point person on several projects, some with outside vendor and some internal. \n My question to the community is, I feel I have a very good picture of IT from a big picture but I would love to become a more advanced network engineer and climb up the salary rank. Where can I take my next step to really speed up the learning process? I’ve done MSP work before but feel they always get bogged down with lower tier busy work and are very cookie cutter from my experience. \n I’ve got my degree and in the midst of attaining my CCNP.

We had some issues with one of our PRI recently that were resolved, and I was hoping that might also resolve this, but the problem has persisted now for over a month. \n Is packet capturing the way to go?

However, being that this is going to use AF VPNv4 and VPNv6 I don't see how I can just keep the next-hop unaltered nor how I could set this up. \n I can't just tell the network \"the next-hop is the loopback of core/dist-1\" like we currently do, since now the network is inside of a VRF\n Just to clarify, the anti-DDoS injects a route with a higher LPREF than the ones advertised by the core/dist switches at this moment, this causes the edge routers to prefer that one and apply policies based on the communities present on that specific one \n \n I have also concerns about scalability, we currently have ASR1004/1006 with RP2@16GB and receive full routing tables from prov-2 and prov-1, IXP routes from prov-3 and around 50k routes from prov-4 (and this is only IPv4)\n  \nOur equipment is a mix of Huawei CE68XX and Cisco ASR1004/1006. \n Any ideas, hints, or guidelines, especially if you have solved an issue like this before would be really appreciated.\n Regards,\n    submitted by    /u/shaoranrch  \n [link]   [comments]",

When this happens bandwidth at the firewall on our WNA interface and our LAN interface is both minimal, 4-5 mbps if now lower. The problem disappeared till it started again a few days ago. The ISP says something on our end is maxing out their AdTran 5660 CPU causing it to start discarding packets.

We have mostly used Cisco Meraki and Fortinet in the past so Juniper is not our strong suit but from what I can tell they seem to be setup correctly to handle broadcast storms etc., but I could be missing something.

On the one hand, we are obliged to use a firewall and requests from the Internet to the CDN service must pass through it. But should the return traffic go through the firewall? For example it might be possible that traffic from the Internet is only 1 Gbit/s, while outgoing traffic can reach hundreds of Gbit/s and it seems unreasonable to use firewall for outgoing traffic, because we trust our servers, plus we need a more expensive firewall. But on the other hand, if the return traffic won't pass through the firewall, the routing setup will be a bit tricky, plus we'll get asymmetric routing and so on...\n ​\n So, again:\n What is the best practice for deploying a firewall for a CDN service hosted on-prem DC?\n    submitted by    /u/istonru  \n [link]   [comments]",

Over the last 3 months we've been experiencing complete failures at a very alarming rate. We're currently running IOS-XE v17.3.5.\n Switch failures have occurred for various reasons, entailing:\n - PoE capability of switch death (Non PSU related).\n - Switches experiencing faulty boot flash requiring more RMAs.\n - Switches randomly bricking with no lights whatsoever. Just a complete and total death.\n - Switches randomly bricking and giving \"BOOT FAIL W\" error on console and non-recoverable. Can't even access ROMMON. Validated via Cisco bugID CSCwb57624, but not recoverable via power cycle/reload as noted in Workaround: https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb57624\n Further, after our team pushed Cisco to how unacceptable this has been, they came back acknowledging a potentially faulty batch of many of our C9300s with corrupted DIMM.\n Guys... In my 15+ years of networking and having managed C3750/3850s for the majority of my career, I've never experienced or witnessed anything like this from Cisco.\n For years now, I haven't been fond of the direction Cisco has taken their Catalyst platform with moves like axing Catalyst IOS, consolidating IOS-XE to catalyst hardware, and their continued merakification of Catalyst which lacks the tight integration needed for rock-solid stability (IMO). \n Cisco's moves have mostly felt more like cost-cutting measures than anything truly beneficial or innovative from an engineering standpoint. It's all giving me FirePower vibes which is why Palo is now dominating that market-space.\n Anyone else running C9300s in their environment at scale?\n Any failures?\n What software chain?\n I can't imagine our org is the only one experiencing this.\n    submitted by    /u/rndmprzn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mostly worked in places that couldn't afford or didn't need all those features and a new ISP that did a Juniper/Calix combo. FINALLY started working for an employer that has the scratch for Cisco with Palo Alto for Firewall.\n TL;DR: I'm very green on what Cisco hardware can and cannot do.\n We are getting tasked with stopping users from being able to communicate directly with each other within their same subnets. They only need to communicate with specific servers and cloud services.\n With Calix, I was able to use a protocol called Mac Forced Forwarding (MFF). In conjunction with DHCP Snooping and IP Source Verification, the switches forced all traffic to the gateway where a host was assigned via DHCP. My original thought was to use this and have the PaloAlto's regulate this traffic. Well to my surprise, these catalyst switches (9200, 9300 and 2960) do not have this feature. Seems to be limited to ISP grade switches.\n I tried using Switchport Protection (Private VLAN Edge) and this worked when the workstation where on the same switch. But it allows me to communicate to other workstations on other switches. While all of my access switches do trunk back 1-to-1 to the core switches. If I put those switch's uplinks into protected status as well, I might get what I need. Still \"testing\" this out. \n I'm also looking at VACLs but I haven't fully grasped the cisco mapping features yet.\n Can anyone give me some suggestions on how to tackle this requirement?\n    submitted by    /u/FireBean01  \n [link]   [comments]",

Would that be normal behavior for an ISP? Would they not trust the private AS as they were the ones who provided it to us in the first place?\n Or is using an ROA just not possible where the originating AS is a private one?\n We do have a public AS that was recently assigned but have not started using it just yet.\n    submitted by    /u/Kslawr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I instantly assumed the host default gateway was wrong as I could ping directly connected but no further, however the hosts address/subnet mask and default gateway are 100% correct.\n ​\n Was wondering if anyone had a similar issue, the router is question is a Cisco ISR 1100.\n    submitted by    /u/RikBaron  \n [link]   [comments]",

None of our Customers have Services that are available through port forwarding nor do they use VPN connections. They have a proper professional Endpoint Security Solution (with Firewall) installed on every device.\n Now to my question: Does it make sense to deploy a \"Next-Gen Firewall\" into their network? I don't really see any benefit they would get out of an expensive Firewall compared to say a small MikroTik Router doing NAT (properly configured of course, VLANS etc.) . I heard that all those fancy things like Deep Packet inspection come with their own Downsides that i would rather not deal with. (And my Endpoint Security Solution supposedly does the same thing but right on every device with little to no configuration)\n Do you think the added Security weighs out the cost of buying, monitoring and maintaining a Firewall for such a business?\n I personally would think the money is better spent on awareness trainings for the employees than on such a device. \n What are your thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/DerSanzi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is an FYI post. For the last 2-3 weeks we have been having intermittent flapping of connectivity within our Meraki AutoVPN network. We have 4 offices in a mesh topology. The event logs on our MX firewall would show entries for 'VPN Tunnel Connectivity Change' and 'connectivity: false' while specifying the peer losing connectivity. It seemed to happen on the hour, and last about 5 minutes. Ping attempts during that time would timeout between offices. However, normal internet access was not affected - only the VPN tunnels. So what was the cause? After working with a couple of engineers at Meraki support, some suggested firmware upgrades and rollbacks (to no avail), we requested an escalation of the issue. After some analysis on their end, they discovered that the VPN Registry servers we were using were very busy. They changed our primary and secondary VPN registry servers. Since then, no more issues. Hoping this post will save someone some time in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/bmessinachicago  \n [link]   [comments]",

That brings me to the question, does someone here have experience working with flexiWAN, who could point me to study resources or anything that would give me an insight into how the tech works ? Any help will be wholeheartedly appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/MikeZTheMemer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys.\n Currently have a small network with a single ISP line. We are adding another ISP with matching address space. Our address spaces are from the provider and are too small to advertise with BGP. \n Outbound traffic seems pretty easy and lots of options with FHRP/track objects/route maps/etc but was wondering about inbound traffic. We have an authoritative DNS server being hosted on-prem. Wondering if I could add multiple glue records with each provider's address and have multiple host records to allow inbound traffic to failover.\n Also wondering the pros/cons of using VRRP vs track objects and a floating static route. Have labbed the scenario just having a floating static on the main provider tied to a track object and having the secondary provider router inject a default route into OSPF. If the primary goes down then the static will be replaced by the OSPF learned route.\n    submitted by    /u/Comet_D_Monkey  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL;DR: How do you use REST APIs to improve your monitoring abilities?\n  \nWith the increase of focus on DevOps has led to performing many actions and automated tasks with APIs! You can write a script that performs actions on a device or group of devices, and make intelligent decisions based on the CRUD responses. \n What about for network monitoring? API calls to devices can obtain much of the same information, if not more detailed information than SNMP MIBs can get - but how could they be worked into an operations environment? \n Most environments, mine included, have a number of monitoring tools. We use a combination of SolarWinds, DNA centre, Intermapper, and a few other methods. These systems poll devices every second (or several seconds) for new data. This is no different than the request/response format which would occur for API calls. \n  \n Are there tools built to utilize API calls to network devices? \n  Have any of you ever built a custom web application specifically to display their desired information in specific ways? I'm not an application or web developer by any means, so I can't speak to the complexity for a task like this, but I'm more looking into the need for something like this if there are existing commercial tools that do this already.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/MikeDeansMustard  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am very new to Aruba but worked with Cisco for a few years and most recently Alcatel-Lucent (unfortunately). The issue that I seem to be having is that at my branch location I have a newly deployed Aruba 6100 that sits in the IDF and connects via SM fiber back to the MDF. I have been using VLAN 100 for my native VLAN and my networking equipment all lives in that subnet. On the MDF side, I have my VLAN assignments set up like this\n BR-44-MDF> show vlan members port 1/1/49\n vlan type status\n 100 default forwarding\n 112 qtagged forwarding\n 164 qtagged forwarding\n 184 qtagged forwarding\n 188 qtagged forwarding\n 601 qtagged forwarding\n When I set my native VLAN on the Aruba switch trunk to match the MDF I lose connection to the switch and have to wait for the checkpoint to revert my changes back to the native VLAN being 1 before I can access the switch again. My trunk interface on the Aruba side is set up with \n Native VLAN: 1\n Allowed VLAN List: 1,100,112,164,188\n I also noticed that the Aruba switch VLAN 1 is pulling a DHCP address in the same subnet as my VLAN 100 address which surprised me that it didn't throw an error for overlapping subnets. \n BR-44-IDF# show ip interface brief\n Interface IP Address Interface Status\n vlan1 10.1.94.21/25up/up\n vlan100 10.1.94.125/25up/up\n I am not sure if I am missing something silly that I need to do in order to stop this behavior and have the VLAN 100 act as the native VLAN with a static IP instead of VLAN 1 with its DHCP-assigned IP. Any help in finding the piece I am missing would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/N3TW0RKJ3Di  \n [link]   [comments]",

So far so good. \n Now I face 33(!) SA's which are established on the Sophos. Let me point you a picture:\n Sophos : Site A\n Checkpoint: Site B\n ​\n Site A got following Networks:\n 192.168.105.0/24\n 192.168.100.0/22\n and a Host 192.168.40.100/32 \n ​\n Site B:\n 10.3.0.0/24\n 10.2.0.0/24\n 10.1.0.0/24\n 10.1.7.0/24\n 10.1.4.0/24\n 10.1.6.0/24\n 10.1.2.0/24\n 10.1.1.0/24\n 10.1.8.0/24\n 10.1.5.0/24\n 10.1.3.0/24\n ​\n I'd love to do SNAT on Site B, but I've never done that on Checkpoint. I know on FortiGate we can use 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 and let the Policies do the Denying. Is there a way to do that on Checkpoint or how would you go about this problem ?\n    submitted by    /u/No_Bumblebee_5793  \n [link]   [comments]",

I work for an MSSP and we have a customer sending Meraki logs to our SIEM - they have enabled FLOWS, which results in a \"flow\" type as well as a \"ip_flow_start\" and \"ip_flow_end\". The flow log contains more data than the start and end logs - it has the mac of the source, the outcome (allow or block)\n As far as I can tell, the only value of the start and end logs are calculating the elapsed time of a flow. However, there is no unique field that ties the two together, only the source and destination IP and port. \n I don't think the SIEM has any rules that rely on the calculation of flow length - so I figured I should just turn these off to save the customer some $ on data ingestion costs.\n Has anyone ever disabled just the flow start/end logs? In the interface there is only the Flows role. Googling this tells me the customer may need to engage Cisco support in order to do this?\n    submitted by    /u/Unreasonable_Yam  \n [link]   [comments]",

My Unifi switches recognize both SFP modules, but I cannot get the two switches to talk to each other with the fiber line that works just fine with the TRENDnet modules. Does anyone have ideas?
