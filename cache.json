          "description": "Hi all,\n After the Rackspace ransomware incident in December, I migrated my email to Microsoft 365 because I didn't really have the time to explore other options. Now that I have, I want to free myself from both Rackspace and Microsoft altogether.\n I have numerous reasons for not wanting to stay with Microsoft which I won't get into as it's not really relevant. My issue is more of a technical one.\n So, I'm planning to migrate to a regular IMAP provider and have been able to enable IMAP for my M365 account, but with MS disabling basic auth I can't use imapsync to migrate the email due to it having issues with OAuth.\n I'm not above setting up a local IMAP server and converting my PST file(s) to Maildir if that's what it takes, but I'd rather find something that will just copy everything across and not require any user intervention.\n So I guess my question is whether anyone knows of something that will allow me to do this.\n Powershell script, bash script, installable applications, anything that works and which is NOT \"Copy everything across manually\".\n I run Linux at home and Windows at work, and I'm ideally looking for something fully functional and free. I'm not against paying for software, it just feels like a waste paying for a license for a program I will use once, as this will be a one-time thing.\n    submitted by    /u/rainformpurple  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi. I received an email which has some attachments destroyed. I assume that some SMTP gateway destroyed that during spam or antivirus scanning. The message was completely recompiled (I know the sending tool and the original MIME encoding was completely different). I want to help the sender to identify the bad device and wonder if it is possible to identify the vendor of the gateway by the used MIME boundary?\n This are the used boundaries:\n boundary=\"----=_NextPart_000_7D6C_01D92C30.D0148B80\"\n boundary=\"----=_NextPart_001_7D6D_01D92C30.D014B290\"\n Sadly, the header does not give me any hint about the gateway because I do not see anything in the received fields except the last outgoing IP. This device seems to also remove anything previous.\n Due to a google search, I think it may be a Checkpoint firewall, but is there some experience about such headers?\n    submitted by    /u/Kukulkan73  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve been with this same company for 12yrs and I have seen a lot of changes over the years of my employment there. When I first joined it was a non-public company, my previous boss was great, I had time to research on certain projects, put in extra time (not because I had to but I wanted to). Within the years of employment, I’ve seen the company become Public, I’ve been promoted several times, made a name for myself (all the execs know me) and now a manager leading two different teams. However, I feel that it has become more stressful. For me personally I’ve also had things change over the years, I got married back in 2020 to my best friend and we now have a newborn (Baby Girl). I just returned back to work last week and I’m currently struggling on getting back into the groove of things. I’m use to sometimes staying late just to catch up on some work or go in on the weekends to help with maintenance that I can’t necessarily do during the week. You might be asking, why am I doing this…? Because of staffing issues. Yes, I lead two teams but they are a small team and most of them have just started within last year. At this moment, I feel like I’m slowing down and I cannot possibly stay late anymore nor work on the weekends as I use to. My fear is loosing my job due to performance as there are a lot of projects but I feel like staffing is an issue.

I'm going through our backlog of vendors and requesting these of them so I know where we stand risk wise.\n Every vendor I've reached out to has supplied a SOC2 Type 2 or ISO audit report after throwing an NDA my way.

We'd like to point out that diagrams in SOC 3 report are publicly available as a preview, the actual files in high resolution fall under the Security review that we conduct for Enterprise customers only. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused here, but as per our internal Security Policy it is not possible to share the docs in question with non-Enterprise customers and that is not something the Support team is allowed to share at all as we do not conduct Security reviews.\n  \nI've reached out to them to see if they'd fill our security questionnaire in that case.

Would it have any more weight than if I was just an Engineer at a standard enterprise, or is it about the same? Thank you I'm advance!\n    submitted by    /u/CrescentFalls  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm especially interested in feedback from this crowd since I imagine many of you have pushed out large scale distributions of thunderbolt docks - possibly varying models and brands.\n I dipped my toe into the waters of thunderbolt starting 4-5 years ago with the Dell WD19. I only got around 10 of them in place, but every single one of them would periodically stop recognizing that they had an ethernet connection until the user unplugged and replugged the dock and then rebooted their laptop.\n Then around 3 years ago I rolled out about 50 Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Gen 2 docks with matching X1 Carbon laptops. It seemed like around 50% of those docks ALSO had similar issues, dropping ethernet occasionally, as well as USB devices no longer being recognized, and HDMI outputs dropping their signal. Again, easily resolved with a reboot of the laptop and maybe a power cycle of the dock... but frustrating my users. Since then the reliability rate seems to be much improved... about 90% of those docks are fully reliable now running on Lenovo's latest 3.1.81 firmware plus Intel's latest thunderbolt drivers/firmware. Though oddly, the remaining 10% are unreliable despite all of those same updates.\n And so I've moved on to replacing those remaining 10%, and have mostly been replacing them with the Caldigit TS4... which is obscenely expensive. But (knock on wood) so far with a limited roll out, I've yet to have any user call me about an issue once the initial setup and firmware update was done.\n    submitted by    /u/Threxx  \n [link]   [comments]",

After three weeks that I felt like I was failing constantly, not being able to focus on the important tasks and being overwhelmed with the sheer tasks to do, my boss is finally coming back on Monday. \n That said, I attended company dinner today. Before the meal, the CEO and the higher ups thanked the whole staff for the successful last year. The junior CEO started with some basic things and then suddenly goes: \" and we got a letter in our complaint box. I want to read it to you\". For those who don't know what a complaint box is, it's a box where you can file complaints anonymously. I was shocked when the Junior read the message out loud and the first thing she said was my name. My whole body tensed up. Then she continues \"I want to thank you for your help. You are always kind and you solve all my problems. I whish the company would give him a extra reward\"\n I was not expecting that at all. It never happened to me before. It gets even more surreal. As the clapping the toned down, service department leader stood up and said: \"On that note, i want to add that he is alone at the moment and has a shit ton of work but he even worked late yesterday because I needed him to set up something for me\"\n This feels so great. Some people actually do care for and notice the effort I put into my work. I think this will be forever engraved in my memories. Has anyone of you similar experiences? Does that happen a lot? It really does make a difference if you get praise from people around especially on days I fell like I suck hard.

For those accounts/PCs, when logging into the device, the password is case sensitive and using incorrect capitalization will cause the login to fail. However, it has come to my attention that for at least one of our machines running Windows 10 Pro (21H2, 19044.2486), which is connected to a consumer Microsoft account, Windows accepts the login password regardless of the case of the letters. That is, if the Microsoft account / PC login password was BlueCyber, a user could login with bluecyber or BLUECYBER or bluEcYbeR.\n Everything I've read makes it sound like that shouldn't be happening.

I mean, after a spate of therapy and treatment for depression and anxiety, I've been referred on for ADHD assessment. I've just set the ball rolling on that now, because ... well, I know self diagnosis is something of a dubious thing, but over 20 years in the profession I'm increasingly believing that \"this is me\". \n But I've fallen into an ecological niche in the business world that suits my brain. \n Because my 'coping strategies' are also ... genuinely beneficial for a 'sysadmin' role. Being great at analysis and problem solving helps me cope with really poor memory retention. I often can't remember things from the previous day, let alone week, but ... that's ok, because I can get to the same place and continue quite rapidly. Working off tickets means my retention doesn't matter. Hyperfocus on something that interests me is amazingly useful when it comes to understanding how all the pieces of a complex system mesh together. etc.\n There's also some things I just know I can't do though, and I avoid those.\n https://www.ted.com/talks/jessica_mccabe_this_is_what_it_s_really_like_to_live_with_adhd_jan_2017\n The standard ADHD screening questionaire is this one: \n https://add.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/adhd-questionnaire-ASRS111.pdf\n    submitted by    /u/sobrique  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't find any rule that should be blocking s3 unless it got lumped into the adult content category by Microsoft lol.\n It also does seem to be actually blocking random images on websites I am visiting (that use S3 to host those images)\n These blocks are not showing in Defender protection history on our machines and they are also not showing in the Web content section of security.microsoft.com either (not certain how long this takes to show data). I've received about 15 of them in the last hour so I am hoping this isn't the start of a fun Thursday morning tomorrow.\n Maybe I am being a little gun shy here after last Friday, but I was curious if anyone else is seeing this or have any other ideas on places for me to look? \n --EDIT--\n Thanks for the confirmtion\n The issue appears to be related to Edge Smartscreen blocking connections to S3\n    submitted by    /u/Artemis_1T  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have a customer who has 20+ of our systems and the HMIs are Rockwell PanelView Plus 7 Performance Series A terminals that run Windows CE 6.0. Due to Windows CE 6.0 being obsolete, Rockwell has phased out Series A and introduced Series B terminals that run Windows 10 IoT Core. Now, with series B terminals- IPP printers are supported.\n At the completion of each product run, a report is generated on the HMI and a screen capture print is sent to the printers via network. It has become extremely difficult to find a modern printer that is still compatible with the drivers available on Windows CE 6.0. With the introduction of the Series B terminals, our customer now needs to maintain multiple printers- ones for the old Series A terminals and ones for the new Series B terminals.\n Is there a print server solution available that would emulate older printers that the Series A terminals can send their print job to via network using an existing Windows CE 6.0 printer driver, then convert and re-transmit the print job to a modern printer (IPP)?\n    submitted by    /u/Dustball_  \n [link]   [comments]",

In there, sat a guy next to a Concurrent. This is a mini-computer that was installed in 1987 - and it's still going and needed to support some legacy equipment we supply out in the field which is still in use (and has one of these sitting next to it). I haven't seen a real-time computer with a built in 6250 tape drive since probably 1990 and it was incredible that this thing was still chugging like a champ.\n It's isolated of course, but the tech on it is probably immune to attack anyway as who the hell out there can hack a machine which no one out there even knows it's OS.\n It's a testament to the company, to the guy who's operated it for 35 years and the fact that they have adapted it to operate using modern tech (SD cards) and keep it going.

Repeat for each client rollout and it ends up being an exponential amount of time spent on negligible tickets for end users. \n As a way to reduce client call-ins following the \"go live\" date: I was wondering if there was something in Azure AD like group policy that could be configured on event (example: attempted basic authentication AFTER go live date) to trigger a notice with custom instructions on who to contact internally if they are confused?

According to the ticket, the customer would call the liquor store (physically attached to the side of the grocery store but has a different address), but the call will be sent to the grocery store instead. The customer tried this a few times before eventually giving up and driving to the liquor store. This is when we finally got word of the issue. It turns out, this customer was calling 411, asking for [Business name], and getting routed to a register phone in the grocery store. The register phone would then automatically forward to the office since it's not able to take outside calls.\n ​\n So, my dear Sysadmins, I ask you....when was the last time you (or someone you know) used 411?\n    submitted by    /u/2HornsUp  \n [link]   [comments]",

In short im taking a 08R2-DC migrating to a Esxi 6.7 hosted WS2016 VM where i would like a \"fresh start\" on rearranging the older AD. \n ​\n I currently have an active AD/Forest that im preparing for a migration over to Microsoft Server 2016, im in the process of cleaning up old objects and folders but im running into issues deleting items that haven't been active or used in quite some time. Im getting a \"you do not have the sufficient privileges to delete \"intern 15-16\" or this is protected from accidental deletion - yet im currently using the domain/sysadmin account.\n This AD has seen several owners prior to my hire 5+ years ago and im trying to strip the AD down to everything minimal in the sense of active users, computers and basic object folder - not extra clutter. I feel getting the AD somewhat back to a fresh start would be easier in the long run, all the permissions and groups need to be revisited as there are groups for folders that a \"S\" would appear in what used to be a user - it annoys me.\n If i can confirm these arent marked for \"accidental deletion\" is there a way to remove them or even set back to default an AD object tree? I dont know if i can afford to create a new AD on the WS2016 or if its possible to migrate only specific workstations or users from the older DC. \n ​\n I do plan on rebuilding all the file folders on the File Server with correct permissions moving forward but im trying to leave as much of the old infrastructure behind as i can without having to migrate over a potential issue. \n ​\n ​\n TLDR; is there a effective way to cleanup old AD DS permissions and broken paths in AD to prepare for a Migration to WS2016 smoothly?\n    submitted by    /u/travvy13  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have had multiple users report that our IT service desk webpage keeps opening itself randomly. \n This morning, I went to see a user and do some digging. In front of me she started typing an email, pressed shift+A and the IT helpdesk web page opened. She closed it, and then went back to her email and pressed shift+A and the helpdesk did not open. Each user reporting the issue says the same thing. There is no consistency as to when it does it or what key combination causes it. \n I have searched the registry for the domain of the helpdesk without the https:// or trailing slashes and nothing came up.\n I have checked all desktop shortcuts for keyboard shortcuts on the helpdesk shortcut, but the user did not even have any shortcuts to the helpdesk in their profile anywhere. \n The user I was with went off on the ward to sort some bits out whilst I dug into the issue, and I asked the other user in the room if they had the same and they said they have had it happen randomly to. It happens on different computers and it does not matter if they use the ward generic account or their account, it happens either way. \n ​\n Has anyone come across this or got any ideas as to where else I can have a look? The bit that has thrown me off is the keyboard combination that triggers it is not static. I am sure I have had this happen to myself as well.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/fusrohdann  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been doing fine on my own, but recently, the company hired a new warehouse and shipping specialist to handle shipping and receiving packages as well as to keep track of inventory for the whole company. \n In about three months, this person has engineered a situation where now the company is dependent on her to run the business: every time we need the get the materials to build the stuff we make, we need to go through her to get it. She did it under the guise of improving company operations and keeping better track of inventory, however, I strongly suspect she is far more interested in gaining control and power within the company. I am extremely creeped out by her. \n Now she's is targeting my department. She has been demanding that I hand over my inventory of computers, servers, networking equipment, etc. I think she wants to engineer the same scenario with me, where if I want to deploy a new computer/server, I have to go through her first. So far I've resisted these demands, mainly due to security, as I don't want the information of our sensitive IT infrastructure to fall in the wrong hands. But the other main reason is that I'm just flat out creeped out by this person. \n I've been with the company for longer than she has, and I have enough clout with two of the owners who are siding with me.

And I assumed that they must be bad so was planning to replace them with SATA SSDs but I realise after a quick google search, I may have been on the wrong path. And I asked a question about the disk failures here and the answers only provoke more questions in my mind. \n As a novice who just started out on system administration, I'm now wondering what's the best disks out there for what I'm trying to do and what's the best RAID configuration for what I'm trying to achieve?\n I understand that there are countless ways of doing what I want to do.

I might be better off as the resources are pooled together, I'd like to understand how I can do it better with what I have (by may be replacing just the disks) and also a future plan when the budget allows to strengthen my infrastructure. \n A colleague recently told me that disks fail for whatever reason and if they're in warranty you just claim from supplier or you buy a new one.

I work for an MSP subcontracted to a customer and I'm struggling to find a solution to managing access for the guest wireless.\n The customer have a Wi-Fi network set up for guest use using Meraki NAT so it doesn't touch the LAN.\n Previously they had a preshared key that was given out to guests who came to their office. This worked for a while until people started complaining it was mega slow. I log on to Meraki cloud manager and find there was more than 100 devices connected to this SSID. This network is also speed and bandwidth limited to preserve resources for LAN traffic on the APs. It looks like people had been using the PSK to add their own personal devices to the guest wireless thereby slowing it down.\n Before Christmas, the password was changed and it was decided it it was only visible to IT staff who enter it into guest devices when they arrive, but this is far from ideal for a number of reasons.\n I have also suggested changing the password every month and only giving the password to the receptionist who then gives it to the guest. But there are concerns from management the receptionist will just give it out to anyone and we are back where we were before.\n I did look at the Meraki sponsorship option for the guest wireless but this has no reporting feature and no way to authorise specific people who can be sponsors. Again, this is a problem because people will just start authorising their own devices, with no way of seeing who is doing this.\n All the APs are various Cisco Meraki models.\n How are you guys managing guest wireless in your workplaces?\n    submitted by    /u/Psjthekid  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some other applications that share significance or that rely on the internet connection also can't update or work online while some can. There were couple of weird things that left me puzzled, I tried to get on google chrome, while it let me access the internet, could download stuff on it, However, when I tried to get on Mozila or other indie browsers i ended up with \"No Internet\" error. When I used Jdownloader for example on google drive I couldn't access it but when I used bittorrent I could download stuff from it. So through trial-and-error approach my leads were to try and stop dns client via group policy which was impossible because I couldn't even click on the stop or pause button. I also attempted to flash ipconfig via cmd, renew it as well but it didn't work. What else I tried was to controlset1 and change its value to 0 in the regedit, I also attempted to manually enter the proxy 8.8.8.8 ip in the internet settings, none of it worked.

And I have some disks failing with different RAID configurations so I have the following questions if someone can help with them please. \n  \nI have a RAID0 disk that I boot esxi from and I'm scared to lose that disk (like I lost another boot disk). I realise now that I should have at least specified RAID1 so I'm planning to do that but I need advice on the best way to go about this. The current boot disk is a HDD and I'd like to move to SSDs. How would I just failover to the new RAID1 configuration without issues? Thankfully I have empty bays where I can plug the new disks in for this server so hopefully this is not too difficult? \n I also have a RAID5 configuration on a different server where I've exhausted all the storage bays and one of the disks failed. Now, the problem is that all these disks are HDDs. I know that I cannot setup an array of HDD & SSD in one so how do I go about replacing these? To be specific, I have 8 1TB HDD disks on this server and since then I've been able to purchase 1TB/4TB SSDs disks so I'm trying to find the best way to upgrade/fix the issues as I've found HDDs to be less reliant. \n  \nThanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/the4amfriend  \n [link]   [comments]",

If it was just 1-2 VMs I'd just copy the VHD over to the new drives and use the VHD as the storage for a new VM but I've got quite a few of these to move and I'd like to know for the future as well.\n Downtime is expected and perfectly fine, I've just never done this kind of migration before and want to make sure I don't do anything unnecessary or leave myself open to forgetting a config (My predecessor did this forgot to assign more than 1 core to more than a dozen VMs and no one noticed for months lol)\n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/DH_Net_Tech  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is meant with outage in this context technically? When i can still visit a site with accepting the risk its not a 100% outage right? \n Maybe this is refered to some backend service when there is a expired ssl certificate?

We access the environment via AWS user VPN which then traverses a site-to-site VPN to the environment. We considered using AWS Workspaces for this, however it does not play well with our external IDP. This has us back to the drawing board on solutions.\n First, I'm curious if anyone has personal experience with this using AWS AppStream and what up/down sides came with that. What I am unclear about is if I can use AppStream to connect to a Jupyter or Datalore instance running on-prem across the S2S tunnel or will it only work with SageMaker in the AWS VPC?\n Second, I'm open to any other solutions. What was attractive about VDI and AppStream is that we can control copy/paste and file transfer. But, with workspaces and our current IDP we can't get MFA enforcement working.\n Thanks in advance for any help.

Instead of spending a few thousand dollars on upgrading the aging hardware I'm considering migrating them to Azure AD / Intune as they have mentioned moving to the cloud. This could be beneficial from a management perspective as well as no hardware costs and potential hardware failures.\n Their current setup:\n  \nDomain Controller - Windows Server 2016 \n Used for very basic AD functions and DNS (DNS would be migrated to the Fortigate). Pretty much just used for creating users and authenticating them to the domain, no complex policies or in depth configurations.\n \n File Server - Windows 10 machine\n Microsoft 365 Business Standard licenses - Outlook & Office apps\n  \nI am unsure of the best practices when it comes to migrating everything over smoothly. The client heavily uses AutoCAD & Revvit and stores all of their files on the file server, so its unlikely file storage would be moving to the cloud but I would likely upgrade the file server or replace it with a NAS. They use Fortigate VPN to occasionally reach the file server from home to access these files. Will I run into any issues if we keep the local file server and move them to the cloud?\n Would you recommend migrating this client to the cloud and if so what would be my best course of action? From what I've gathered it sounds like a fairly simple process, upgrading the Microsoft 365 licenses to Business Premium, setting up AAD, Intune and Autopilot, either saving their profiles with Profwiz or wiping their devices, joining to AAD and letting autopilot do the work.

I woke up this morning like any other morning and while scrolling through Reddit in bed, I saw the first few posts of the problem being reported. That sure was a wake up call. \n Thanks to the OPs, commenters with solutions, and others chatting, I was able to \"fix\" and reduce the impact of the problem before everybody starting showing up. My org has tens of thousands of devices and employees. This problem would have been a nightmare to handle. Thankfully, because of those posts and comments, I was able to stay 2-3 hours head of Microsoft's response, which saved us. It's very rare, but we were able to set up full resolutions and responses before users started to call us with problems. Overall, we had a few thousand devices impacted, but it only ended up being around 35% or less of our total fleet. Still bad, but it could have been sooo much worse. I know I can't be the only one in this boat.\n Talking with multiple Microsoft employees (Support, fast-track, devs), they asked me to link to the Reddit posts that I quietly brought up when I said it was a global issue. Congrats to those OP's! Your posts have been seen by everyone! It looks like Microsoft is currently working on solutions to help with impacted shortcut files so only time will tell at this point.\n Again, big thank you to everybody, from the OP's to the people leaving comments. Even the lurkers up voting topics. Today is one of those days where I'm thankful that a community like this exists. If you had this problem at your organization, I wish you a speedy recovery.

Each server has close to 60TB of data stored on these external shelves. They're in production, and actively serving customers. The two servers and all 6 shelves are covered under a support contract with HP.\n On December 14th I opened a ticket with HPE Support using the serial # of one of our servers which is under support contract. After a month of back and forth regarding firmware / BIOS updates required on the servers, and sending numerous AHS logs, and doing a bunch of un-related troubleshooting, the support engineer tells me that they can't do any more and I have to open a case up using the disk shelf's serial number.\n Why couldn't you fucking tell me that at the beginning!! Instead HP support wasted a month of our time. Days between responses on a ticket that is marked as \"Critical Degraded\". Stressed us out over the holiday's causing several of us to have to work over the holiday's to run CHKDSK on the volumes, and worrying that our data might get lost.

It's legit.\n On current revisions of Windows, 10 and 11:\n January 10, 2023—KB5022282 (OS Builds 19042.2486, 19044.2486, and 19045.2486) - Microsoft Support \n There is a vulnerability in WinRE, that if unpatched...\n 🔃 Security Update Guide - Loading - Microsoft \n What kind of security feature could be bypassed by successfully exploiting this vulnerability?\n A successful attacker could bypass the BitLocker Device Encryption feature on the system storage device. An attacker with physical access to the target could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to encrypted data.\n Are there additional steps that I need to take to be protected from this vulnerability?\n Yes. You must apply the applicable Windows security update to your Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). For more information about how to apply the update, see Add an update package to Windows RE.\n Are both offline images and WinRE in a running environment affected by this vulnerability?\n No. Only a WinRE image on a running PC is vulnerable. This can be any time a recovery or reset operation is invoked from the main OS.\n ​\n So:\n 1) JUST the CU doesn't fix it. You have to patch WinRE. Most people won't do this.\n 2) Since the Windows Recovery environment is not encrypted/protected, someone could just 'replace' the WinRE.wim file with an 'old, bad one', and exploit this vulnerability, even if you patched 'your' device.\n Have any organizations/anyone else spoken about this? It seems to have effectively slipped under the radar, and while it would be 'hard' to exploit, maybe, and 'hard' to replace a WinRE environment... it's not THAT hard.\n I'm not saying \"go 3rd party\", by any means, but this seems... bad? Maybe I'm mis-understanding/reading it, but this seems like, for the current Windows revisions, a 'permanent' issue.\n    submitted by    /u/Hotdog453  \n [link]   [comments]",

But once it is set it will be correct next time this user logs in.\n So this only happens the first time each user logs in. \n The soundcards are not the same in each classroom so we are not going to take care of this by some group policy.\n I know about the default user profile settings, but the computers are all on domain but with different soundcards between classrooms. So what I am trying to figure out is the best practice if I can log me in on the computer for the first time locally, set the sample rate to correct settings and then every other domain user that logs in after that will get the same settings. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/gasgeir  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Since I started working at my current employer there has been a lot of patching and fixing various security holes. Guy before me was tech savvy but not comfortable with server environments etc, the age old tale. Without going into too much detail, we have a department which does a lot of development. Until recently, all of these employees (approx 15 people) all had local admin rights (users added to AD group, GPO set said group as local admin on all workstations). Obviously we don't want that many admin accounts, even if they only have those privileges on workstations and not servers etc, let alone people who do not work in the IT department. \n As you may have figured out, this caused some outrage among the developers. We are not big enough yet to have a \"functional\" helpdesk and utilize LAPS in an effective way so I'm still walking around approving installs. However, so far that has only happened once since this change was applied. This makes me believe 1. they vastly exaggerate the amount of times they do things that require admin privileges (no surprise) and 2. This is more of a \"hurt ego\" situation where they are more upset over being \"downgraded\" than it is an actual issue. \n Do you think I made the right call or is it overkill? \n TL;DR: Developers lost their admin rights and are upset. I think it is a major security hole to let an entire department have admin rights. I believe they are more upset of having been \"downgraded\" than it actually being a problem, but I'm doubting myself. \n Thank you!\n P.S I am the only one doing IT and we are >100 people in three countries\n    submitted by    /u/simedr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Remote server is Fileserver, domain controller, app server, FTP server, print server... you name it. Local is a DFS target and a \"backup\" DC. \n We all know this is not ideal. I know. Well sometime in the last 30 days, my domain controllers stopped talking to each other. Remote is PDC, other is onsite. They are in separate sites in active directory. The onsite one is out of sync and now can't authenticate against the PDC. So all shared resources (printers, mostly) no longer work. Nor does DFS replication. \n We got lucky on this one. After getting a manual printer mapping going, and trying to do it the 'right way' to repair the link I said screw it. I demoted the onsite DC, removed from domain and then re-added it to the domain. I learned a lesson there. Also the lesson to set a monitor for the log events for if this issue happens again. \n I'm hoping that my RCA of this will finally convince my boss that they need to break out the roles to individual vms and (if I'm really lucky) get a 3rd DC vm spun up... or just move the app server to an Azure App, remove on prem domain and just do local printer mapping.

I have had issues with my boss in the past, he is known for picking on employees and had complaints before. I have a couple of peer evaluations (8) and self evaluations, but none of that data was in the supervisor evaulation. Long story short, my boss gave me low marks across the board and cited this as his summary. \"namiiscool23 attitude towards his new supervisor (had him only 3 months) and lack of professionalism needs to improve, had it not been for this his performance would be much higher\"\n I put in ALOT of work and have great peer review, my boss is not technical and does not understand DB administration. So I challenged my evaluation because my peer evaluation, where I picked leaders and people I work with closes gave me high marks. Even my old supervisor gave me good marks. I brought this up with HR and now they are launching an investigation on my Boss. It is worth nothing, that he had 2 people leave this year and I talked to one of the people that had the same experience I am facing. On our call, he said he felt isolated and nitpicked for flaws. But his evaluation was not harsh as mine, this individual was surpised by my score too.\n They want to interview me and asked for me not to talk to my old boss or boss's boss.

Needs to be able to be only touched by a few individuals who have the credentials to access what is being stored on the NAS and remote VPN into it. 2. NAS company cant be apart of China, Russia, or Middle East related company due to the storage on the device. 3. device will need to have redundancies of course.\n My questions are, should the device be placed on a subnet on the already established network at the HQ? Should a separate network be created that only houses CUI related items to ensure that the storage device can have added security measures that the main network does not implement?\n ​\n Thanks for any help in advance we are heavy in the research phase.\n    submitted by    /u/gangusTM  \n [link]   [comments]",

Eventually, it broke, and because it's deprecated, MS refused to help us fix it (the no IPv4 issue was also a point of contention, but we worked around it). So, we moved to Always on VPN configured to connect to our Sonicwalls. Unfortunately, some users complain of frequent connection drops, and for a significant number of people, the \"Always on\" functionality just isn't there, they have to manually connect it.\n Ideally, we'd like a machine based VPN that connects before login (like DirectAccess), so thinks like SCCM can function without an active user.

I can do basic programming in JAVA, C#, and Python. I've built quite a few computers over the years, I've troubleshoot a ton of issues. I did once work in a PC shop building/repairing computers when I was a teenager but now I'm much older. I'm pretty good at figuring out solutions to my problems. \n The job is help desk however I'm kinda wondering am I really prepared? I guess you could call it imposter syndrome? The person who hired me says he's confident, but I'd like to hear about others and their first IT job experiences.\n My end goal is I think I'd really like to be a System Admin, or director of IT. I know I don't want to be anything like a software dev.\n    submitted by    /u/ImbambiBitch  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I think this is the right community for this topic, but if you think there is some other more adeqaute sub reddit, please tell me.\n I am in the process of migrating our Hpe StoreVirtual (LeftHand) VSA cluster to a new (and supported) solution.\n Our HCI infrastructure is a basic two nodes stretched cluster, in a network raid 10 configuration. These two nodes are in two different CEDs rooms, connetcted through a 10GbE fiber cable. LeftHand has proven to be a reliable solution in these 8 years we used it.\n The only (big for me) cons I have toward Hpe is the support policy: if you do not have a valid maintenance contract, no one besides hpe personnel can gain access to the OS in case of problems. I mean the OS of the StoreVirtual virtual machines that \"do the magic\" abstracting the local storages and make them visible to the vmware cluster as a (one or more) vmfs shared datastore(s).\n Our reseller strongly advised us to move to Hpe SimpliVity, because that's the natural step forward basing on our specific topology. SimpliVity too has the (big) limit above: once it will go EOSL you will not be able to gain access to the \"ninja\" console in case of troubles.\n Personally, I gave a look to Vmware vSAN solution and I proposed it as an alternative to my reseller. They discouraged me for the following reasons:\n - VMware vSAN solution is not natively fit for a two nodes stretched cluster. It born for a three nodes cluster, and in order to cover the gap with other vendors, it later adapted the solution to work with two nodes solutions as well.\n - vSAN does not have the \"data locality\" peculiarity. Data blocks for a given virtual machine are written across the nodes, independently from where the vm is located. SimpliVity, as opposite, has this advantage (inherited from StoreVirtual VSA after all).\n Do you agree with this analisys or the reasons cited above are weak and vSAN is in any case a better solution for my cluster topology?\n Thank you,\n Francesco\n    submitted by    /u/bianko80  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "90% of our servers are dev servers and we have about 100 of them (Vm's). WE had sccm which was covered under our gold partnership but we lost gold because MS sucks. Our laptops are covered by intune anyway and it just so happened we had a catastophic failure and lost our main sccm server. We actually could restore it but we have lost of lot of the licensing for it and dont really need it anymore as we only used it for updates and laptop deployment. So it's only windows updates that is the issue now. I cant seem to recall where I setup the gpo to point to the internal ms server aka sccm. I need to undo this and for now have them all go to the internet until I get wsus setup for servers, I've tried rsop and everything and cant seem to find the right gpo to change this because rsop shows that it is the local policy where this was set. Doesnt the domain policy overwrite local. Do I need to remove ccm etc before it will work. SCCM is a weird beast to undo\n    submitted by    /u/dmcginvt  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Good morning,\n I run IT for a small defense contractor. One the compliance controls we have to meet is some sort of authentication before users can access our network. Our users all exist in Azure AD, so my thinking was that I'd implement some sort of SSO portal users must go through when their computers join the network in order to gain full access to the internet and internal resources on the network. \n However, all of the solutions I've seen seem to be designed to work with an on-prem AD, which I'd like to avoid deploying if I don't need it. Are there any tools you all are aware of to achieve this goal? Maybe even through SAML?\n Our networking is handled through a SonicWall TZ300 and a few HP Office Connect 1920/1950s for reference.\n Any guidance is greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Extension_Lunch_9143  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We have a small accounting dept of about 3 people.\n They have 2 contractors who do work for them.\n We have no on prem infrastructure, everyone uses SharePoint.\n Problem: When the contractors make Excel workbooks, they link other workbooks to it. Then when they drop it in SharePoint you open an Excel doc and all the links are broken. The only way to \"fix\" it is to go into every new Excel workbook and manually update all of the links to point to the source files they put on SharePoint. I cant expect accounting to do this all day, I wouldnt want to either.\n This is a HUGE problem. Accounting has files fractured everywhere and the consultants with all these inter workbook links are making everything a tedious mess.\n What is an appropriate solution to this? I imagine step one is getting the consultants to actually START the workbooks in the same space that we will end up accessing them from, and also keeping the sources there for links. Assuming they will actually listen to that, is SharePoint a workable tool for it? I need something that doesnt involve VPN but also isnt too complicated to learn for the end users and consultants.\n ​\n Thank you!!!!\n    submitted by    /u/Future_Is_Cloud  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now we run mostly Win2012R2 and Above on the Servers and Domain Controllers and all the Linux Servers are at least RHEL7. We do keep RC4 Encryption enabled. We I started RBAC on the child in which the Exchange Server Resides, I enabled Kerberos and it broke the Exchange Server that resides in the Child (All services were running email was not flowing).

The eventlog is jam packed with errors, the same as you see in the link below. We have a fix in place that works well, and the user is up and running again, but I am struggling to find the culprit/cause of this.

          "description": "Hello fellow sysadmins.\n We have a certain user in our organization, which of reasons I am not really able to discuss, is in need of a very strict computer policy, mainly in regard to web browsing.\n The user itself has asked for a surveillance solution where they know that every X second a screendump is taken and saved to a location the user itself cannot access, but that the user knows a supervisor both has access too, and frequently browse through. This will effectively prevent the user from doing wrong things on the internet as they know they will be “caught”. \n In addition, we are thinking of installing a VNC-server so the supervisor at any time can connect and remote view the screen. This will pose as an additional “threat” to the user to not do anything they should not be doing.\n Any tips regarding a working web filter would also be appreciated. \n Obviously, we will have a signed contract between the end user, the supervisor, and the company in regard to this deal. We will also make sure local authorities accept our solution as not to violate anyone’s basic rights. But like I said, most of these ideas originated from the user itself, and we believe the legal part of it won’t be an issue.\n Technically we are hoping to run this on a domain-joined desktop with Windows 11.\n In summary:\n 1) Need a software/solution for taking a screenshot every X second and save to a folder inaccessible to the user itself. Other ideas are welcomed. \n 2) Software alternative to VNC in order to being able to remote view a computer at any time without end user interaction.\n 3) Any working webfilter to block certain types of websites.\n 4) Other tips on how to set up a secure and surveillance of a computer in order to make sure the end user knows they cannot perform any foul play even if they are tempted to, or technically able to do so.\n    submitted by    /u/perlebajs  \n [link]   [comments]",

Almost all PCs do have enabled Remote Desktop Connection, which works great. We also have WOL set up, which also works great. During COVID time the need for a work-from-home option has been introduced. So we set up remote access to PC via Remote Desktop Gateway. We also put 2FA on it. Also no problems. Last month our boss told us, that we need to set a policy on all PCs that would put them to sleep (so the company can lower the power consumption and especially the bill for it) after more extended inactivity. So now the problems start.\n Most PCs wake up when you want to connect to them via RDC (either inside a company or from home), but some just do not want to wake up and the RDC window put out an error for failed connection. But the strange part is, that if we send the WOL packet to the same PC it will boot/wake up without a problem. So BIOS and NIC are configured correctly for WOL. Are there any different settings for waking up PC from sleep when there is network activity to it? Did any of you experience similar problems?\n I'm grateful for any answers or suggestions.\n Regards\n    submitted by    /u/neklaf  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are currently powering the crucial servers which host the domain controller vm's etc via a gasoline generator with 240v extension cords lol. \n Needless to say the power outage sparked a big conversation, at work, about the cost of maintaining on prem AD environment. For instance we had to call an electrician to fix an issue with our generator, how often do we need to be testing out the equipment in the case of another power outage, etc.\n We have a hybrid AD env but the most crucial files are hosted on prem. I floated the idea of moving certain files shares to azure so people can work (process invoices) in the event of another outage, among other things.\n As I started looking into replacing AD with Azure AD I came across the this article (mentioned in the title of this post).\n To the more senior sysadmins out there what are your thoughts the article and more importantly it's general sentiment; e.g. Azure AD is not a replacement for on prem AD but rather an enhancement?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Limp-Exercise7734  \n [link]   [comments]",

During a true up/consumption review, they operated in pretty poor faith and bent us over for several hundred thousands per year extra.\n The issue stems from the original scope expanding and OKTA professional services being engaged to do the architecture. This effectively resulted in additional orgs being created that weren't necessary and we had users cross federating between them which created duplication or triplication of users and jacked our consumption up. At no point were we informes we should account for consumption or take additional user life cycling measures.\n As a result we've got 4 months to fix it or piss them into the wind and go to another offering. We came from Azure MFA and SSO, has anyone ever gone back? Has anyone else had any bad experiences with OKTA that left a bad taste?\n    submitted by    /u/SystemErrorzorz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "LOL I installed XP today. \n I had a bend press out on the production floor give us the old ‘no hard disk found’. Took the computer out of the machine completely dismantled it to get to the hard drive (it’s basically an all-in-one attached to the machine with a swiveling arm and the back of the case is a inch thick aluminum plate which is the heat sink for the pc). Put a new IDE SSD in it, restored the ghost image, and put it back together. \n ‘no hard disk found’\n Grrr. Started to suspect that something more than just the drive was crapped out. \n Got the forces in motion to request lead time and cost for a new (!) computer, which would still have hardware capable of - and running - Win XP (the servos in the machine require specific software which only runs on XP)\n 6-8 weeks. $60k\n ‘Wut’\n Took the computer back off and pulled it apart again. Retraced my steps to see if I missed something. I didn’t. \n Put it back together. \n Back in the machine, I booted the computer again. \n ‘Invalid partition table’. \n Interesting… it sees a hard drive. \n Took it back apart. \n Hard drive back into the ancient laptop we keep around just for this kind of stuff. \n Had to get creative.\n I suspected the MBR to be missing/corrupt. The replacement SSD had smaller capacity than the original spinner. I had to tell our ghosting software to resize the partition, which I think messed it up. \n So I wiped the drive, looked and found a XP Professional dvd, and installed a fresh copy. Once done, I booted the ancient laptop back to the ghosting software, and wiped the partition I just created with Win XP install. \n I then ghosted our backup image back. \n 30 mins later, I had the computer back in the machine and it was time to go for a test run. \n Booted right up, they’re happily running production as we speak.\n    submitted by    /u/rhutanium  \n [link]   [comments]",

My boss is American and has been quite harsh on me lately.\n A few years ago, he decided to outsource some of the company operations to the Middle East. That didn't work too well but still kept some guys there.\n Part of my job is to provide these guys in the ME with training and advice, which I do in almost a daily basis. What is happening is that they don't seem to comprehend any training I give them. I have been giving them countless of trainings and spent a lot of hours that ended in nothing. \n They get the idea but when it comes to real work, they cannot connect the dots. I'm not an English native speaker so I'm not quite sure how to word this without sounding too harsh.\n I recognize I'm not the best instructor and possibly being English not my first language has something to do with it but still, I'm puzzled. Not sure what to do. Is it cultural? Maybe they are not thinking logically? I don't know.\n Example: I teach them how to solve an issue (e.g restoring a backup). They say \"Ok, understood\". When the same situation presents again, but varies slightly, they screw it up and cannot solve it thus making my boss really angry AT ME. \n If something changes, even slightly, they get mega confused and cannot solve it.\n Have this ever happened to you? If yes: How did you explain it? \n This is probably more a linguistic question than a sysadmin one but still I wanted to try here. \n I'm so tired of being reprimanded for other's people mistakes.\n Thanks for reading 😥\n    submitted by    /u/Diex233  \n [link]   [comments]",

The links are still in use for backups and communication so maxing out the link would be a best case scenario.\n I know the old and new units have got a SAS port but can that be used for copying data or is just for disk expansions?

Internally or to other e-mail services there is no issue. I have tried every reasonable recourse such as remaking signatures, changing my e-mail address and so on.\n Recently my dad who works in a different position in my company also started having the same issue. And a while back my brother who works at a different company had also reported similar issues.\n So today I created a test tenant with Microsoft to troubleshoot. I just did out of the box developer config with standard e-mail filtering for the receiving address - which is what any company on O365 is likely to be running.\n What I found was that as long as my display name includes my last name (a 4-letter word with one regional character) Microsoft categorically flags the e-mail as junk. This is regardless if the e-mail comes from my company's domain or from my private domain. As long as the display name includes my last name, it is considered junk by Microsoft. My first name doesn't have any impact.\n If I change the name by replacing or adding a letter, it is no problem, so it is specifically this name that is always flagged as junk.\n So apparently people who have my last name are by default not allowed to send e-mails to companies that use O365 for e-mail. This should affect a few hundred people at least. I already have a support case open and am planning to talk to my contact at Microsoft, but neither of those options have been very useful in the past. Is there more I can do to restore my family's honor with Microsoft?\n And also, who tf uses display name to filter spam? That seem insane.\n I have had users in my company report similar issues in the past but it passed after they changed signatures and such, but for me and my father it seemed like our last name in the display name was the only thing that impacted spam filtering.\n    submitted by    /u/vemundveien  \n [link]   [comments]",

Would be swapping industries from local govt to a private healthcare company.\n First interview went great, nailed it I think. They called me back for a follow up today to meet with the CIO. Also went really well.\n In the course of the discussion I asked about their health coverage. I have a wife and son and we all have medical needs in some capacity. I was given a copy of their benefits handbook for new hires and was told to expect a call within the next day or so.\n Once I was home and settled I took a look at the health coverage and HOLY CRAP!\n Even their lowest tier plan was more than double what I am currently paying through my counties insurance and they are both Florida Blue.\n I thought that it had to be the total before the employer contribution so I reached out to the recruiter and he passed the question along to the companies HR.\n They confirmed that those numbers are the employee share. Their initial offer was 13k more than what I'm making now but would actually be a 7k pay CUT after selecting the plan that provided the coverage we need.\n I countered and told them I would need 5k more than the top advertised range for it not be a total wash. 30 minutes later I got a call saying they could go up to the max, but not above it and I had to politely decline their offer.\n I was honestly shocked at how expensive their coverage was and how little it covered. Maybe it's because I've been in the public sector for the last decade but there is no way I can see paying $1700/mo to cover myself, wife and son just so that mental health visits are included.\n I was also baffled that their mid tier (still 1300/mo) was the same plan number I am currently enrolled in BCBS 5302 but my coverage (PPO) has FULL coverage for counseling and mental health office visits, no co-pay or anything.\n Oh well...\n    submitted by    /u/morilythari  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not going to get into how much of a joke the amount is, how with inflation I'm technically taking a pay-cut for the 3rd year in a row. No, that's been said before. I want to call out this blurb:\n \"To protect your private information, details of your compensation should not be shared with other employees...\"\n It goes on to say that you should contact HR if you have any questions/concerns/etc... about your pay. I have read several articles and forums that suggest we should in fact be talking more openly about our salaries. That would encourage fairness and quality. That would allow job seekers to know what the starting pay is along with how much others in that same position make after a few years of tenure. However, in the real world knowing that Slacker McCoy over there doing 10% of the work gets paid the same as me, and Flipper Jones in the other building makes more than me, would really build some resentment and in turn a hostile work environment. I can see it from both of those points of view.\n Unions are pretty open about their salaries and public (government) jobs are typically a line item on a budget someplace and public information, so you can find that too. Is it because companies need to stay competitive so they keep compensation a tightly guarded secret?\n ​\n EDIT: Good convo so far but leaning heavily on the legality of the request. That wasn't really what I was getting at. I rather like my job and the organization I work for. We have posted pay ranges and grades so I know roughly what most people are making, if I cared to look it up. I was just wondering what the general thought was behind the secrecy amongst peers. \n    submitted by    /u/SaltySama42  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have checked repeatedly that there is no trace of either user in the AD object, and I see no errors in the AD Sync logs, but 365 still has them present. I can't remove them in 365 because it's an AD-mastered object. \n Short of deleting the group completely and starting a fresh one (which we will eventually do anyway in our normal DG -> MS Teams upgrade process), any ideas? \n One note - this domain used to have on premise exchange, but the removal was extremely thorough and no trace of the old org exists. I have no on-prem Exchange management tools available to troubleshoot, the Ex2019 installer fails to install the tools because it can't find the org.

Or an insight on “what’s the next big thing”? \n Any and all suggestions are appreciated!\n P.S my work does fund training but that is already being used in more network related areas.\n    submitted by    /u/CoastAccomplished673  \n [link]   [comments]",

Only after the audit is completed, and we propose a contact with them, and they accept, do we go forward with RMM tools.\n ​\n What im looking for is a tool i can use before the later stages of us installing, example, ninjarmm agents on the computers.\n ​\n In short, is there any software (preferably free, but will consider paid as well, depending on the price), that i can arrive on someone's network, plug into their network (or connect wireless), and scan taht subnet, and get all the system info for all devices?

I have narrow shoulders and am short, to boot, so it hangs too low and is pretty uncomfortable walking around wearing it when it is full of 15\" laptop, chargers, cables, misc parts and batteries, etc. I saw this thread on different sub, and the Everiki Atlas looks great except some Amazon comments say it is large for a small person to wear comfortably. Looking at other posts on this sub, I do love Swiss Gear but yeah, too big. Comfort matters more as I age.\n Any small people who have recommendations? Some brands make \"women specific\" packs for narrow shoulders and smaller frames, but these are mostly hiking type backpacks. I like the multi-section approach of a tech specific pack like the Atlas, and since I also want to use it as an under-the-seat backpack for personal travel, I appreciate the extra features of easy access top pocket, sleeve, etc. I may just buy a 11-15\" Atlas and try it, but thought I'd check here first.

When I create a symbolic link to a network share, then navigate to that symbolic link and open any subfolder on that share, the context menu \"New\" option only shows the \"Folder\" option with the UAC logo. See this picture.\n These are the steps to recreate the issue:\n 1. Create a symbolic link on a command prompt: mklink /d d:\\LocalFolder\\ \\\\NAS\\NAS_Folder 2. Navigate to d:\\LocalFolder 3. Open any subfolder inside that symbolic link. 4. Right click/New. You will see only the \"Folder\" option with the UAC shield. \n It's worth noting that if I directly access the \\\\NAS\\NAS_Folder and open any subfolder, the New menu shows all available options and the UAC shield is gone.\n What's going on and how could I prevent that behaviour? Disabling UAC from registry only gets rid of the shield but the context menu still shows just the Folder option.\n PS: I've tried this also on a recently installed Windows VM.

I know this seems like a very very vague question but I've just been really struggling and getting stuck at different points during each attempt. \n (worst case scenario we could hire someone to set it up, as our college IT doesn't want to get involved in our pet projects, but the goal is low cost)\n    submitted by    /u/mreilly0605  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a container that I want to expose to the public internet which acts as a proxy to a private subnet hosting a bunch of applications. The exposed container is an authentication proxy that validates auth headers before forwarding upstream to the private subnet.\n Is the idea to put the auth proxy container on the host network since host can communicate to all bridge networks? From here, I would put NGINX & all software on a user-defined bridge network to isolate from the public internet but accessible via the auth container on the host network?\n Curious if I'm missing anything with respect to security and isolation.\n Example:\n  \nAuth Proxy: Network mode is host running on port 80 and 443 for plain HTTP and TLS\n \nNGINX: Runs in user defined bridge network, let's say 172.16.0.0/16\n \nApp 1: Runs in same subnet defined above with static IP 172.16.0.5\n \nApp 2: Runs in same subnet defined above with static IP 172.16.0.6\n \n I don't want the public internet to be able to talk to NGINX or App 1 or App 2, but force communication to proxy through auth container bound to host. \n As an additional question, is it true the host can always talk to a container on a user-defined bridge network? Is it possible to ensure only App1 & App2 can only be communicate to via NGINX and not the host?

          "description": "I have no idea how IIS works, so please forgive any obvious lack of some fundamental understanding with this question. After so many years of system admin experience, I honestly feel kinda silly typing all this out:\n So, I have a webserver at my office where multiple sites are hosted. So there are several domains all pointed to, for example 192.168.1.50. How is the traffic differentiated between domain1.com and domain2.com when IIS receives the traffic?\n If I am setting up a second webserver or troubleshooting dns issues, etc, I am aware that I can edit the hosts file locally to force a computer to resolve a particular domain to a different IP. So, for instance, if I am migrating one webserver to another, I can do preliminary testing by updating the local host file on a test PC. I guess my question is, is it possible to pull specific web pages via IP somehow, and not edit the hosts file?\n More specifically, if I simply browse to 192.168.1.50 I just get an IIS page. What would the syntax of the url be if I am able to pull a specific site by IP? I feel like there is some building block here that I'm missing that keeps me from really understanding what's going on here.\n If my wall of text isn't clear, heres an example scenario:\n Web Server 1 - 192.168.1.50\n DNS a record domain1.com 192.168.1.50\n DNS a record domain2.com 192.168.1.50\n I set up Webserver 2 and perform a migration.\n Webserver 2 192.168.1.51\n no DNS records, but IIS is serving out a copy of domain1.com and domain2.com\n So, I can set the local host file on a network attached PC to point domain1.com & domain2.com to 192.168.1.51 and perform some testing.\n Is it possible to pull domain1.com and domain2.com by IP on 192.168.1.51 without editing the local hosts file? If I simply browse to 192.168.1.51 at this point, I would just receive a welcome to IIS page or whatever.\n    submitted by    /u/Senatorsmiles  \n [link]   [comments]",

We don't have any applocker rules and it's only affecting random machines. I can't explain the cause but does anyone know the fix? We have about 15,000 machines+ and our service desk gets probably 5-6 calls a day on it. Re-imaging the machine has been our only fix to this point. If I try running powershell scripts to re-register these apps I get an error saying it was blocked by policy.

But, one main site has a cheap Linksys or Netgear. (I can't remember the brand. But, I'm pretty sure it's one of the two.) \n That site is pushing back on cost and wants to know what the cheapest firewall is that can whitelist CIDR blocks of IPs.

I am tech savvy and in my personal life built computers and always had a basic understanding of how electronics work. Though I am very inexperienced and a noob I still, however, am responsible for 3 networks and their safeguarding and troubleshooting.\n I am the most senior IT person in the company because I am the only IT person in the company except for the new hire who is more hardware focused. I know I have a long way to go experience wise but I am working toward a master's in computer security management followed by Sec+ and Net+. The title at the moment is basically help desk but with the responsibility of a systems administrator, network engineer, and Azure cloud engineer.\n CEO asked me to start thinking about what my next title should be but I don't even know what I want to do in this field. I love IT, love making something work after multiple failed attempts, and the rush of self-accomplishment when the problem is solved. I like working in Azure and Intune, have not tried my hand at coding or scrips because I am not confident in my ability to not blow everything up in the process.\n What I am asking for is just some insight on what a solid next step title would be from helpdesk. I eventually want to become a CISO in the next 8-10 years but just unsure of how to get there. Unsure of what path to take because I want to do what is best for me and also have mouths to feed at home.\n ​\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/gangusTM  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am the CEO of a small software house, we have 10 people on staff and the brunt of our work is designing, developing and maintaining B2B and B2C applications for our clients. We are getting to the point where i belive we are going to need a sysadmin. Both for better workflow for maintaining systems and handling security, backups, knowledgebase and support.\n We work with VPS Ubuntu and also cloud hosting and computing with Azure Portal. All our applications are booted inside Docker VMs\n Im interested in asking what you would say is key knowledge and qualities of a good sysadmin. When i hire developers we usually do a programming challenges is there something similar in the sysadmin space?\n What types of questions would you be interested to ask if you where recruiting a sysadmin?\n Thank you for taking the time reading my post. I hope i did not break any rules, to be clear this is not a recruitment post im only looking for insights from this community since i know alot of strong admins lurk in here.\n    submitted by    /u/wabalubdubdubsub  \n [link]   [comments]",

Getting ready for bed I thought \"Did I enable archive mode after importing the dump file?\". So my anxiety got the best of me. I went to go check and sure enough archive mode was not enabled. So I ran 'shutdown immediate' (which hung for a bit and I thought I was screwed) and then started it up and enabled archive mode. Made some changes in the application and everything appears to be working. Whew! To you experienced DBAs, what would have been the downside to leaving archive mode off? Also, is it worth using RMAN for a 20GB database? The application vendor's DBA helped enable it last year when we moved from on-prem to Azure, but I have no idea how to use it if something went wrong.

About 40 minutes inI notice a call from the recruiter come through which of course I send to voice mail. The interview was originally scheduled for a half hour (lol) so I figured she was just being eager to follow up. Anyhow it wraps up about 15 minutes later and I call the recruiter back. She asks me how I thought it went. I said so-so, it wasn't my best interview, but it wasn't a bad one. \n It turns out that she was calling because mid-interview the interviewer had messaged the recruiter to go ahead and prepare an offer letter.

URLs are in Base64 & HEX but passwords ARE NOT. You can confirm this from Mr. Gibson's show notes. They have directions to obtain your vault/blob via a browser - https://www.grc.com/sn/SN-904-Notes.pdf\n LastPass's offsite cloud backup data was exfiltrated. The offsite backup includes backups from their on-premises servers and regional data(required for regions with regulatory reasons)\n You should check your master password iteration counts. If it's 5,000 and you have a short(most likely 8 character password) you might be in pickle. Steve's also explained this and the history of how it came to be in the show notes. Change your master pass immediately to a longer one *and also passwords for individual sites*. Also up the iterations to 350,000.\n If you're an old(started using it circa 2008 - LastPass's start) LastPass user your vault might be a mixture of passwords in CBC & ECB mode. It seems LastPass has left passwords created in CBC \"as is\" when they realized and shifted to *ECB*.\n  \nThey've made mistakes along the way like having several data breaches. Some are forgivable and can be given a pass. But I do agree with Steve that they should have *automatically \"upped\" the iterations on Password Based Key Derivation Functions(PBKDF2) for all clients*, Pestered people to shift to longer master passwords on client UIs and lastly, shifted those old passwords from CBC to ECB.\n https://youtu.be/9XWHCF4pLmI\n ​\n Edits denoted and enclosed with *\n    submitted by    /u/AdrianTeri  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could perhaps understand AV on an outside accessible web-server or something, but for internal servers like LDAP, DNS, DHCP, print services, those type of things, I've never installed any extra or 3rd party anti-virus. These days, Windows Defender (or whatever it's called) is pretty great at detecting potentially malicious code/tools, and obviously no end-users are touching these machines.\n  \nDo any solutions exist that act like an \"AV server\"? In that, it's a server that perhaps runs a nightly scan on a list of machines, so that a 3rd party AV wouldn't need to be installed everywhere?\n What do you guys do for AV on servers? 3rd party, or Windows Defender enough? Everywhere I've worked we didn't install 3rd party AV on servers. Newest place I work they have Malwarebytes installed on EVERYTHING. They want it replaced with bitdefender and told me to be careful because when they installed Malwarebytes it wreaked havok on the servers, blocking critical services and whatnot.

They only tell you to use the EEM instead (wich is a really cool feature ngl)\n To top it all of: There's a chance of the master-switch to crash and reboot when you try to get rid of the config line.\n *sigh*\n Hope y'all had a somewhat chill start in this year.

I have used IT Glue in the past and thought it was great. \n When I decide to look into their prices, I noticed that they have a section for \"IT DEPARTMENTS\" instead of MSPs. The prices for MSPs show as 5 users minimum whereas for IT Departments it does not say a minimum amount of users (see screenshot). \n I decide to give them a call (book a demo), and they tell me that for 1 user, the price is $99 / month and they can go as low as $59 / month. None of these prices are shown in the website. See it for yourself -- https://www.itglue.com/it-department/\n Any alternative that you could suggest? \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/monedadeoro  \n [link]   [comments]",

I searched the Internet and found out it’s probably a display adapter issue, with most of the “fixes” being to update or install graphics drivers…but I don’t have an nvidia or whatever graphics card to install drivers for. I checked the XFCE server and saw this error (attaching image to this post). \n https://i.postimg.cc/02gDsq5Q/86-E5976-C-64-EE-44-E2-8452-FC62-E47152-AA.png\n Windows is all up to date, all drivers are good. Upon installing Linux I can do Ctrl alt F3 and get to the CLI to check this stuff. Basically - Kali boots but after the Kali logo (before the log in screen) it just goes to a black screen with a flashing “-“ in the top left. \n I’ve done these commands sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade sudo apt install update sudo apt install upgrade\n I’ve tried restarting XCFE with the startxfce4 command and then I see the error that it won’t start.

Remember how like 70% of the team moved out of state to be closer to family or find a lower cost of living since we haven't bothered to give cost of living increases that even remotely keep up with inflation? Remember how with the extremely rare exception of a hardware failure you haven't even seen the server hardware you work on in nearly 3 years? Well have I got good news for you! \n We have some new executives and they like working in the office because that's how their CEO fathers worked in 1954 and he taught them well. Unfortunately with everyone working from home they feel a bit lonely. There is nobody in the building for them to get a better parking place then. Nobody for them to make nervous as they walk through the abandoned cubicle farms. There is also a complete lack of attractive young females at the front desk for them to subtly harass. How can they possibly prove that they work the hardest if they don't see everyone else go home before them each evening?\n To help them with their separation anxiety we will now be working in the office again. If you moved out of state I am sorry but we will be accounting for that when we review staff for annual increases and promotion opportunities, whatever those are. New hires will be required to be from the local area so they can commute and cuddle as well. \n Wait, hold on one sec, my inbox keeps dinging, why do I have 12 copies of the same email? Oh I see They are not all the same, they just all have the same subject line. Wait! you can't all quit! Not at the same time. Oh good Bob, you were in the office today, wait what's this?

Looks like another domain user (domain.com\\paw_admin) is needed for them which has to be inside domain group (domain.com\\paw_administrators) which is member of local Administrators group. Nobody wants to have many MFA tokens.... Am I missing something?\n    submitted by    /u/Beneficial_Youth_689  \n [link]   [comments]",

The profiles are empty, and they have functioning/actual profiles on their respective collection session hosts. Creation date is between 0-4 days from when the new RDGW servers were put into production, and no new profiles have appeared since.\n Anyone know what could cause this?

The service is otherwise reachable from everywhere else (my home network, LTE, etc.).\n The network has 1000 IP's on the same subnet and all devices in the network are behind a Debian firewall running iptables. All outgoing traffic is allowed and likewise for established connections.\n In particular, I have no problem reaching other instances of the same service on those ports from devices in the network. To my knowledge there is no iptables rule that precludes accessing the web service from my network.\n When I run tcptraceroute from a device within network, the tail of the trace is identical to running it from a device outside of the network with the exception that the last hop to the server with the web service is missing. To me this points to the packet being dropped by the server.\n Does this point to a misconfigured iptables on my end or could the problem be that the packets are rejected by the server running the web service when it belongs to my IP range? Everything has worked fine until recently. Port scan shows it runs IIS and only ports among top 1000 that are open are 80 and 443.\n    submitted by    /u/TKAAZ  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I work for a school system, and foolishly installed the December updates before I left for Christmas break. I didn't notice any issues immediately, and honestly, I'm not sure if the updates are even related.\n I run Windows 2022 Server on Dell hardware. I have 3 Hyper-V VMs on that. A domain controller that does DHCP and DNS, a storage server, and a \"support\" system that I use for troubleshooting. The support system will not get a DHCP address from the server, which is connected to the same virtual switch.\n I read about the issues with the Dec update and Hyper-V, but I thought it was for newly created VMs. I went ahead and applied the OOB patch to the host anyways, but no luck. I then uninstalled the updates, no luck. I had DHCP failover setup, so I removed that, no luck. Thinking that maybe something with my scopes was corrupted, I loaded a backup, no luck.\n The odd thing is that the server gets the request, assigns an IP, which shows up in the leases, but the support system never receives the IP. I do have firewall enabled on the server, but outbound shouldn't be blocked. I can use our Meraki switches to give out DHCP addresses, and the support system gets that with no issue. I can ping the DHCP server if I set an IP on the support system. I have 11 servers, 9 of them appear to have this issue, but all were updated at the same time (I think the other two are working, but haven't worried about those until I figure the others out). I actually may have fixed one of them, doing the above...but doing the same to another server didn't help. So I'm thinking it was a fluke, or I didn't find the right combo.\n I'm hoping someone has seen something similar, and can point me in the right direction.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/GezusK  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems like they are trying to be more of a wholesale replacement for a file share, but I can't really tell.\n Any advice on if software like this exists or on best practices for managing a large media catalogue with multiple users and contributors.\n    submitted by    /u/rybl  \n [link]   [comments]",

We’ll need to implement our own alerts to let us know if the Hypervisor or any of the VMs go offline. Something to note is that there is a plan in place to migrate these VMs to Azure or shut them down completely if we don’t need them within the next few months. So we’re looking for more of a cheap stopgap than anything. \n I was thinking of setting up Azure connection monitoring to accomplish this since I see you can also monitor on premise machines. But if there’s something better available that fits this scenario, I will look into it. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/HopelessNinersFan  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I was hired 15 years ago I never negotiated (didn't have a lot of experience at the time) so every raise and promotion has been tied to my starting salary. My current salary, senior systems administrator, is $110k which for here in Ohio I've been happy with. However, after looking at very similar roles I'm seeing salaries of $120k - $135k. I don't want to leave the company I work, it's a great place to work, and the benefits are excellent. What's making me look around is simply my salary which I believe may be a bit low considering my experience.\n The company I work for has a process for adjusting salaries based on the job market. I'm not sure how to approach my boss and do this dance. A raise of 20% would put me more in line with what I'm seeing from other job listings. I'm thinking I'll need to bring in evidence to justify the pay raise but I'm not sure what sources would be best to use. Should I even bring a copy of the other job listing that shows the higher pay or would this be a mad move? I could wait to have a more concrete offer but I know that once that card is played you have to be prepared to leave if a counter offer doesn't occur.\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/systime  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I read on several links (Link1, Link2, Link3), that this probably is a failure of HDDScan. I tried 3 or 4 times, always starting HDDScan as admin, re-assigning the drive since it won't get detected anymore after canceling the Erase Test, turned it on and off again, turned PC on and off again, nothing seems to work. \n Is my drive just flatout broken, does HDDScan just don't work correctly (what am I doing wrong?), is there a fix to this or what is the problem? \n Is there any other way of doing a destructive read / write test on Windows to verify my drive, that this community recommends? I heard about badblocks, but I'm not in the mood to set up a Linux virtual machine just for this and I don't want to upgrade to a Windows 11 Developer Build just to get a functioning mount-command for WSL.\n I didn't test it with the other redundancy drive yet, but since this seems to be an error (or at least it seems to me), I did what any regular human being would do - frantically ask some dudes on reddit. I will test the other drive the following days and can update this thread, if necessary. Any help is appreciated <3\n    submitted by    /u/Sehbehindert  \n [link]   [comments]",

The point of this application is for customers to schedule their own appointments in our system. Boss wants to have a PC set up on location for the customers to utilize this app, so I need to get this PC (that is running normal Win11 Home) locked down.\n What I mean by locked down:\n  \nThe PC should only allow chome to be opened in full screen, and only the application's url allowed. (All other web traffic should be blocked)\n \nUsers should be unable to launch any other programs (i.e. file explorer, cmd, start menu etc.). Ideally, they wouldn't even be allowed to exit chrome's full screen mode or get back to the desktop\n \nDisabling keyboard shortcuts (Win+R, Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Alt+Delete, etc.) \n \n I'm sure this is a pretty common use case for PC's, so the answer has to exist, but I can't seem to find the right words to Google to start figuring out how to set it up. Just a bunch of chrome troubleshooting. Appreciate any advice or references to articles that would give me a push in the right direction.\n Edit 1: Thank you everyone for reminding me that \"Kiosk\" is a word.

My native language isn't English, so please excuse when my grammar is a bit simple.\n The story starts with me and my company, I'm a 30-year-old businesswoman who works in an IT service in a bank space. I'm the girl for everything basically, but I'm a specialist for first level support, administration and backup, sometimes even networking.\n Even when I'm not head of my it department, I'm basically had all the responsibilities of them, but unfortunately my pay grade doesn't reflect that at all. I think of my Boss of my IT department as kinda lazy if not incompetent, he even brags about getting so much money for basically doing nothing.\n I have a 40-hour…",

          "description": "Doing some local group auditing and cleanup and noticed a great number of domain user accounts are members of their client device's USERS group. Since a domain-joined device places 'Domain Users' in the local USERS group by default, is there any reason for having the device's primary user's domain account in the local USERS group as well? \n For example, Sally works for Contoso and is provided a domain-joined Windows 10 laptop named SALLYLAPTOP and account named 'sally@contoso.com'. SALLYLAPTOP's local USERS group has the domain group \"Domain Users\" in it. Does Sally's individual domain account also need to be in the local USERS group of SALLYLAPTOP? \n If the answer is NO, and adding the specific user account is just redundant, why do you think so many machines have the user's domain account in their local USERS group? Is Windows doing this by default? If a domain user signs into a domain-joined laptop for the first time, does Windows automatically add the user's domain account to USERS? And is it worth my effort cleaning up all those local USERS groups, removing those individual accounts?\n    submitted by    /u/jwckauman  \n [link]   [comments]",

After some additional troubleshooting I found that we were not able to dial out after our sip trunks were idle for some period of time, an inbound call would \"fix\" the problem and allow us to dial out. \n I ran a packet capture on a L2 switch in between the SIP trunk provider's SBC & the ISP's router - we see the SIP Invite packets leaving their device but never get a response.\n The SIP Trunk provider states that the issue is they are not receiving those packets. It's about a dozen packets sent to 3 or 4 different WAN addresses. They're stating the the ISP isn't delivering them. \n I want to call BS on the SIP trunk provider as we've had zero issues with our ISP otherwise. I reached out to the carrier anyways to see if it'd be possible for them to \"prove\" they are delivering the packets per the sip trunk provider's request. This request seems to be confusing them. \n Normally I have the ability to just do things myself and figure out who's to blame but this is a new one for me. I tried switching our SIP Trunks over to our backup internet (different ISP) and wasn't able to reproduce the issue but it wasn't a long enough test window that I can say with confidence the issue doesn't occur. \n Any recommendations on how to proceed?\n    submitted by    /u/P_R_woker  \n [link]   [comments]",

My old boss and I built the department from the ground up when I first started there, and I stepped into his role when he left. Like with most small teams, my position wears a lot of hats from management/planning to hands-on sysadmin and tech work.\n Unlike when my old boss left, I don't think anyone internal is capable of filling the role, so while I'm sure the ship will be kept afloat for a while, they're eventually going to have to hire externally. I don't consider myself to be particularly hot shit, but unless they get lucky, they're going to have a hard time finding someone qualified to fill the role for what they're paying. I mostly stuck around as long as I did because of personal investment and the fact I was given freedom to operate and learn, which I value highly. I know their ability to replace me is ultimately not my problem, but I want to do what I feasibly can to make things easier on the guys under me when I leave, especially one who has a lot going on personally at the moment and is unlikely to be able to start job hunting any time soon if things go south.\n I'm giving a three-week notice after new year's. My current plan is to tidy up a couple of existing projects, make sure documentation is all shored up, help with hiring if HR miraculously gets candidates in time, and just generally be a resource until I leave. I might give my boss my contact information to potentially provide services at a contracted rate for emergencies as well, but I'm undecided on that.\n Is there anything else you guys would do specifically in my situation to help ease the turnover for your team?\n    submitted by    /u/timewhatistime  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Is there any living person on this Earth that actually disabled NTLM in his environment?\n Not in a lab or something like that, but with real working functioning production services.\n Because, you know, there is a lot of cybersecurity fuss about switching from NTLM to Kerberos and real vulnerabilities.\n I know that for Kerberos you need to be in contact with DC to acquire tickets or use something like KDC proxy and it is not always feasible.\n I know how to audit for NTLM usage on servers or on DC.\n But the question stands: Has anyone actually did disable NTLM in his production environment? How did it go? What’s the caveats?\n I’m thinking that it is possible to disable incoming NTLM authentication traffic only on some of the servers and audit helps here.\n But the main target here is DCs. So, how about disabling incoming NTLM auth only on DCs? And I haven’t seen any success stories on this matter anywhere.\n I’m asking this question in r/sysadmin specifically, because I don’t need any more guides on how to do it, but actually I need some information from people that actually did it and do support these environments afterwards.\n UPD: I'm not talking about disabling NTLMv1 and just forcing NTLMv2. I'm talking about complete disablement of incoming NTLM auth.

I assure her that we're not.\n The next day, inevitably, she can't log in again. So I walk over and watch her log in. When she's in, I make her log out and back again. And again. After the third attempt, she's convinced everything is good, so I walk back to my desk, and she's right back there saying it stopped working again. \n I was irritated by this time, and I asked her to describe exactly what she did after I left.\n \"Nothing, I swear! My login only works while you're here!\"\n Back at her desk, I watched her type in her password more closely and facepalmed. \n When we gave her a random password or while I was at her desk, she would look down at her keyboard as she typed, and it worked.

We no longer get the quarterly check-in's with fancy charts and future mapping, the MSP IT team really only have one or two specialists that can work on network issues and complex SQL problems, and worse yet, their \"projects\" team is a place where tickets and requests go to die unless we babysit the progress.\n We are looking to move to a new MSP that we believe will be able to meet the demands of our company, but until then we are still semi-reliant on our current MSP to handle routine tasks, be on call, etc.I am working to get their knowledgebase of our company extracted for internal documentation in hopes that we can make a smoother transition to a new MSP at a later date. \n I just want to know what your experience has been with difficult MSP partners, and how to handle them?\n    submitted by    /u/AshenLibra  \n [link]   [comments]",

Session ends.\n User now has an admin command prompt. lusrmgr.msc and they can grant local admin rights to themselves. Undoes everything regarding restrictions on local installs.\n Is this just failure by the user for obviously trying to slip by processes? Or failure of the tech to make sure they watched what they signed in for? Or failure of some larger approach that makes something like this impossible?\n What would you put in place to make it so that a user with an admin command prompt couldn't grant local admin rights? Or is this basically past the point of no return and the only thing you can do is make sure the tech watches what they login for?\n Granted. User's actions are trying to bypass the rules. I'm more curious what can stop this beyond better trained helpdesk tech's.\n    submitted by    /u/jeo123  \n [link]   [comments]",

On every DC, we have a constant barrage of event ID 4412 in Event Viewer, saying there is a conflict between files and the losing one is sent to the ConflictAndDeleted folder. I can’t figure out why this is happening. Files replicate correctly, but any file in the sysvol directory is subject to this error and having the copy deleted. I used procmon to see what files were being accessed. Files are being accessed by DFS service. I think it causes the service to think there was a change, and the 4412 event happens. We had nearly 1,000,000 files taking up 120GB before we realized what was happening. The ConflictAndDeleted folder on every server is slowly filing up, ignoring the limit I put on each CAndD folder in ADSI.\n When the DFS Replication service is turned off, obviously nothing happens. But when it's turned on, files will disappear from the folder, only to come right back a second later. The folder will have 8 items in it, then 7, then 8, and all I'm doing is sitting there watching.\n I've spent days on this, trying every article I can find. We have CyberArk and Commvault on the DCs. It might be the archive bit being changed by Commvault, but it's happening dozens of times a second, with the same files, and only in the sysvol folder.\n Thoughts?\n ​\n Thank you all in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Green-Excitement3147  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have found scripts that would make roaming profiles work with chrome and firefox bookmarks though, so it seems like a viable option.\n Is user profile disks an option here? I know it's designed for RDS, which is not the use case here, but rather profiles on local desktops within the domains. We don't have an RDS farm and would prefer not to set one up if it's not needed (due to licensing etc).\n Assuming user profile disks is a good option here, would it be best to combine it with folder redirection for all the 'standard' files (as it would likely reduce the size of the disk) or is it better to go with just 1 solution to keep it simple?\n Perhaps FSLogix is a solution here as well?

I've searched the web, this sub and a few other forums and the consensus is to break the export down into smaller .pst files by either date or folders.

That voiceless, anonymous entity who wasn't doing backups properly, left AD in a mess, let some critical server support contracts expire...which our intrepid hero swoops in to fix with a theatrical sigh. \"Just another day single-handedly keeping this company afloat...what would they do without me?\"\n Besides being a cheap vehicle for self praise and narcissism, they don't seem to consider how \"their\" network might similarly be judged by any new sysadmin taking their position. Suspending their disbelief for a moment that anybody could possibly take over their very important and utterly unique network, they'd likely find the new sysadmin would have no problem digging out incorrect configurations, design mistakes, oversights, skeletons in the wiring closet etc. \n Because we all have them. Every network big and small. And what we all also share are budget constraints, time pressures, staff shortages, bad management, lazy colleagues. Take these into account next time you're going to shit on the work of the previous sysadmin, especially if you don't know them personally, because I can guarantee you the next sysadmin will equally be able to shit on your work too. It's very easy to disregard the good work done and focus on the \"bad\".\n I just need to remind myself every time I read a comment from somebody \"fixing the mess left by the previous sysadmin\" that they're likely inexperienced, lack exposure to multiple networks, and desperate to display competence to their peers. I was like this too in my first few years in IT, so quick to pick out mistakes to disparage \"the last guy\". Now, with some experience behind me, I find myself giving them the benefit of the doubt, realise that whoever set it up this way may have had extraneous factors going against them, and could probably explain if they were there.\n    submitted by    /u/sycm21  \n [link]   [comments]",

Around the beginning of November, I got a hit from a small digital design company looking to bring on their first dedicated IT SysAdmin/Help desk person. Their Lead designer has been their acting IT person and the job has become so much that he's not able to do any design work. I have gone through two interview rounds with them as of December 16th and they just scheduled what I presume to be the final interview for January 13th.\n Enter job number two, an international industrial software dev. I applied to this job at the beginning of December, and they got back to me a few days later. I had an initial call with the recruiter. A week later, on December 20th, I had my second interview with one of their two IT personnel. He liked me and I let him know at the end of the interview that I had already done two rounds with the first company and was expecting the third and final round around the beginning of January. He thanked me and said that changes their interview schedule a bit. The next morning, I got an email to schedule the interview with their director of IT on the 22nd. This morning (27th) I got an email that they want to schedule a call for tomorrow to talk about final steps. I presume this means an offer because the recruiter told me both people I interviewed with had positive things to say.\n So, we get to my situation. Do I send an email off to the first company to see about getting the interview moved up to maybe January 3rd if possible? I would like to have two offers to mull over rather than getting an offer and either waiting to accept, or accepting, only to get a better offer and have to rescind my acceptance from the second company?\n Edit: ok, an email has been sent.

          "description": "Hi,\n I've got a peculiar problem that I have not been able to resolve on my own. Google does not give any good results and none of the suggestions I've tried seems to help. This is a hybrid O365 enviroment, all affected users have been transfered to O365 a long time ago, problem started about 2-3 months ago.\n The problem is that some users (about a dozen or so) randomly loose the ability to send emails ie the email is not sent but stays in the Outbox folder. Only solution so far is to remove the email profile on the affected computer and create a new profile. That helps a week or so before the problem pops up again for the user.\n When the user is unable to send email I can not open the users email settings from Outlook or from the Control Panel/Mail. Nothing hapens when I try to open \"Email Accounts...\".\n The obvious Send/Receive manually does nothing. Outlook is online and new email arrive without problem. I've tried to reimage the computer, sfc /sannow (yes, I'm desperate), reinstall Office O365, start Outlook in safemode, resetnavpane etc etc. My google foo have not given me any good match nor solution to my problem.\n    submitted by    /u/dreamfin  \n [link]   [comments]",

So we want to have some kind of hybrid environment with mails being in a cloud. We dont want to reconfigure all computers (or at least amount of time if it has to be), have at least amount of downtime.\n Reading MS pages and articles online gave me some info that minimal hybrid migration would be an option. But still there will need to be on prem exchange server to manage users? Are there any solutions to this to get rid of old server or have a newer exchange version on a VM just for management? Also i dont quite understand the line from MS article \"Do not plan to continue to run directory synchronization to manage your users\"? Isnt this hybrid migration?\n Is there a more suitable migration path for this case?\n TLDR version, plan is to get mail in a cloud, get rid off old exchange 2013 server and manage mails on exchange online.

We can set the number of licenses needed and additional users will be locked out, thus preventing compliance issues. Shit bag Autodesk is asking us to purchase 5 3-yr civil 3D licenses to come to compliance, they claim our 2 user subscriptions had additional install/session more than the number of licenses. We asked them to reduce the demand , as those licenses will sit idle and be a waste since we don’t use civil 3D much. They looped in their attorney, and we asked them to communicate with our legal as well. they started to increase their threats, saying there will be a 25% additional penalty if we involve legal. Is this even legal? They are retaliating if wanted our attorney to communicate with them on our behalf? We never threatened litigation or lawsuits, and only asked for our lawyer to handle communication with them as We are too busy to keep discussing it with them. They know we are valid customers, as we spend $40k+ per year on their ridiculously expensive innovyze software, which they recently acquired to add to their monopoly. Any suggestion to responding to Autodesk, when they threatens to add additional penalties to talk to our legal? We paid them the stupid 5 licenses, at this point it sounds like they like to retaliate and have their customers bend over. Funny thing is we have alternatives, unlike architects who are dependent on Revit, etc. In three years we will move towards an Autodesk free environment.\n    submitted by    /u/Dejamletsjam  \n [link]   [comments]",

The PowerShell scripts do NOT have email notification enabled by default. If you have your own email functions, you can swap in your function with the one in the script and uncomment the Send-Email lines within the script(s).\n Please leave your suggestions on what I should add, remove, or change.

It was great experience and I learned a lot from teammates and a kind engineer on the systems team.\n When hired, I was told there were possibilities for growth etc. At the time I had some college experience and a couple months in helpdesk, so it was an amazing position for me. \n The manager of the systems team publicly stated multiple times that he wanted me on his team and I should get training to move over. That was 5 months ago. I got my AZ-900 and constantly asked for permissions to take over more work. I was only ever given permissions to do a task after a month of begging to do more. \n I got a job offer for a Jr. sysadmin position with a significant pay raise. They are aware of my limited experience, but liked my attitude. I gave my old position one chance to match and all I got was a job description of an \"associate engineer\" without my name, the date, anybody's signature, pay was verbal, and no effective date. No thanks \n I'm looking forward to escaping the out of the SD for obvious reasons, but expect to come across an entirely different set of issues lol. I was the glue that held that team together, and I know for a fact that two people will be leaving right after me.\n    submitted by    /u/homeschooledharambe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m a software engineer by trade, now a manager of software engineers. Three years ago my company (around 100 people) had an IT Director, A VP of Technology and an Assistant IT Director. The VP of Technology moved on. Then the IT Director moved on and the assistant was elevated and finally he left a little over a year ago.\n Recently my company asked me to be Director of IT and I said no. I got a look at what all needed to be done, our security needs, etc. and decided it was too much for one person and not what I wanted to be doing, so I said they should hire someone and turned them down.\n Recently, they started asking me to tackle specific IT tasks as one-offs and I’m finding myself drifting back towards a role I said no to. Being asked to take on more and more responsibilities related to IT. \n I’m not sure what my question really is. I’m just lamenting the situation, I think. With some institutional support for decision making and maybe some staff to actually execute, maybe I could do the job. I don’t have the experience specifically in IT, though, and I’m muddling through based on having 2 decades of general software experience and enough systems experience to be dangerous.\n There is definitely more to this job, however, these days. More than just knowing how these systems work. There’s prioritizing the various risks the company faces and executing the implementation of systems and processes that we’re now behind on from years of neglect. To say nothing of how to deal with upgrading equipment, budgeting for long term maintenance, etc. It just feels very overwhelming and I’m wondering if it’s crazy that I just want to walk away.\n    submitted by    /u/DSGamer33  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "MDF flooded today (12/26). Well more than just the MDF, like most of the building flooded today when the fire suppression system and water main exploded in multiple places. We're talking 110PSI of water flying out from an 8 inch water main somewhere in the ceiling and just destroying everything. I had a co-worker show me video of a poor HP prodesk getting blasted with unbelievably high pressure water.\n This actually started on xmas (yesterday), I was watching over the cams remotely and seeing the mess unfold. At the time it didn't affect me so I just sat at home and watched the chaos unfold. I thought they turned the water off for the whole building but today around noon - more water lines exploded in a few more places - and one of those was the MDF.\n By the time I got in there, it was no longer raining from the ceiling. \n It was bad - water was pouring out of the 5x Aruba switches that sent network to the rest of the building, about 7/8 of the network was offline. Luckily the server room and about two IDFs not in the chain were fine. Basically, only the basement of the building near the server room, and one random hallway was unaffected.\n After 3 hrs of using a leaf blower to help the internals of the switches dry, I decided to go for broke and connected them back and they all worked! That part of the network was only down for about 4 hours, so in all honesty I think it worked out pretty well, most people were out of the office so it wasn't that much of an interruption.\n It will hold for tonight but I think I'm going to get my 10g network upgrade very soon. Eventually corrosion will kill those switches.\n    submitted by    /u/jfarre20  \n [link]   [comments]",

First time posting on this subreddit, so please forgive me for any mistakes. \n I am starting a company where I will give my partners/users, an android device, which has a few apps they still use to access my service.

To give a better insight of what’s needed and why I will provide a short description below.\n  \nA way to remotely access the devices so that my team can do the debugging in case something goes wrong, instead of having to try and explain to the users what to do. \n With this I am also looking to heavily restrict what apps can be accessed, and also settings so the device can only be used for its actual purpose, and the chance for problems by pressing something wrong occurring decreases.\n An easy way to automatically set up the devices with the right apps and restrictions, perhaps using a connection to a pc or something along those lines.\n  \nI have looked a bit into the Soti platform, but as far as I have understood I need a dedicated server with databases and stuff to use their solution, which is per today not an option. \n The perfect scenario would be a cloud based system for accessing the above mentioned functions, preferably a cheap one too since we are a completely new company with not much money to spend.

Supposedly you can ingest firewall rules from your devices into the program and it plots out your network for you, showing you what could potentially be exposed to the internet and on what ports so you can review and shutdown any open holes you're not fully aware about or got lost in bad documentation/poor communication issues.\n It's pretty pricy though, the 1st demo I had looked decent but the inventory side of it i've already accomplished via Netbox. I could do the network topology too via Netbox but that's manually entering things in instead of allowing a tool to go out, grab the firewall rules and ingest it properly. I'm sure there's a ansible script method I could use to poll all that info and feed it up into Netbox's api but that's more work then I have the time for currently.\n Was curious if there were any other open source alternatives to this tool or people's thoughts and opinions on it?\n Mostly a RHEL/Ubuntu shop with some Windows hosts peppered throughout.\n    submitted by    /u/HauntingDebt6336  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have 11 entry level IT certifications, MCSA, Exchange, LPIC, ITIL, Comptia, CCNA the basic stuff.\n At the moment I work in an office as internal IT in a team with 3 other junior admins. We are the escalation point of the helpdesk which does suck because we still have to do helpdesk work. The helpdesk techs are on the lowest level I have seen in my career, tech and communication wise.\n My coworkers like to waste half of the day talking about Marvel with the helpdesk technicians and all other types of nonsense. (This will not improve with current management and will probably take years to turn around)\n I currently work on IT projects with other teams and my senior colleague which is interesting. But I do not get any useful input from the other junior admins, they prefer slacking off and goofing around. So, I am kind of a one-man army I have only my senior colleague as a sparring partner and he has a full schedule.\n I find it hard to stay motivated, I am the most technically knowledgeable person in IT besides the senior admin and architect. My colleagues do not show any interest in improving and I have to spoon-feed the helpdesk. So it feels like I do all the giving.\n Does anyone have any tips to deal with this?\n    submitted by    /u/DancesWithWolves123o  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the initial configuration of Azure AD Connect, ADFS was configured as the sign-in method. So, during the the AAD Connect wizard on the new server, we have to choose « Federation with ADFS » at the « Sign-in » step, and then, selecting the existing ADFS farm.\n My main concern is about the next step \"Azure AD domain\": (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/media/how-to-connect-install-custom/adfs6.png)\n We have several federated domains, and here we can choose only one. What will be the impact for all the other ones ? And also for the one that I will select ? All these domains are already correctly federated, I don't really understand what will happen at this step.

Most of our storage usage comes from Windows 2016/19 file server VMs.\n How would you compare HPE Nimble to EMC Unity especially in regard to deduplication?\n All of our ESXi hosts are Dell R750s (upgrading from R730s)\n Thank you for any help or advice.\n    submitted by    /u/lngdgu  \n [link]   [comments]",

It would alert us (via text, email, or app notification) when the temperature goes outside of a specified range or when it loses connectivity or fails to report within a certain time period. And last, keep a record of temperature reported so, when it loses connection, we can see what the trend was. \n It seems to me this is a decently big ask on a small budget, but I thought I'd reach out and see if anyone has an experience or recommendations in this field.

Meaning I will still be committed for a year even if I pay monthly.\n So I essentially tell them that in that case I will have to cancel because I don't want to commit for a year\n They respond with saying \"Go ahead cancel then because we only do yearly subscriptions\".\n Honestly, hope they go under.\n    submitted by    /u/ITFurAlles  \n [link]   [comments]",

Have fun with it.\n Brief summary:\n  \nWIM backup always requires an external bootable media such as a USB flash drive.\n From this drive WinPE is booted to perform a backup or restore to or from an external medium (e.g. a USB hard drive).\n On the bootable USB flash drive the WinPE must be set up before (is documented illustrated in the readme).\n After completion of the respective operation, a status message is displayed whether the operation was successful or failed.\n After restoring a backup, you can boot normally from the destination drive.\n Both the backup and restore process are relatively simple (not \"rocket science\").\n To set up the solution, you need about 30 minutes time in the best case due to the necessary downloads (e .g. ADK)\n  \nThe project can be found here: WIM-Backup\n    submitted by    /u/cx1423  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Looking for advice on Mitel VOIP appliances. Recently joined the business and there is a Mitel VOIP appliance in play for the usual VOIP business requirements. Took a look at the setup and at first glance there is some good practice: the VOIP is hosted on linux servers sitting in their own VLAN segmented from the rest of the network. The only public facing server is the Mitel's conference bridge suite. \n But there is something i dont understand cause i lack experience with this VOIP software - 1) the controller is being hosted on a Windows OS, iirc its supposed to be on Linux boxes, 2) the devices are domain joined - so i assume the creds of our admins when they are logging in and out of the Windows OS VOIP controller, will be leaving their creds behind in memory no? Or even a LSASS dump could result in compromise of any domain admins that have administered the Mitel suite in the separate VLAN? Am I panicking over nothing here?\n Seems kind of obvious to me that eventually someone will pop the internet-facing conference bridge, move to the Windows OS controller server in the same VLAN, and then dump creds until they find one that can break them out of the VOIP VLAN and get into the rest of the network. \n Any thoughts?\n Should the Mitel VOIP stuff be domain joined? \n Should any of the VOIP VMs be a Windows OS?\n Is this setup as vulnerable as i feel it is?\n    submitted by    /u/Apprehensive-Pie-599  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you guys know a proven way to archive this please let me know, I think this would help a lot of people working as IT support around the world.\n    submitted by    /u/oberonpr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Data recovery is in the process but it will take weeks at best and I am not getting any high confidence from the data recovery team. I have an online backup of user data but no viable backup of the actual DC or any other servers that I can restore. I say that, but there is a remote possibility that I can restore my DC from 6 months ago when we upgraded from 2008 to 2022 and swapped roles, etc., however, that is looking like a pipe dream as well (this would be the 2008 server).\n It is a Hybrid Office 365 environment with on-prem DCs and Azure AD (free) for authentication and all. I am assuming that if I were to create everything from scratch (new Forest and DC) there is a high likelihood of all mailboxes getting affected as well because the on-prem SIDs and GUIDs and Object IDs would be different from what they were previously. Waiting for weeks isn't happening but I need at least some domain functions back to survive the carnage.\n I am looking for some bright ideas to get out of this mess!!!!\n My terrible options at the moment are:\n  \nCreate everything from scratch and deal with hybrid issues later\n Hope and try to restore the DC from 6 months ago and minimize the impact to only new users from that point on.\n Can Azure AD be the savior here? - Can the information in the cloud be used to spin up a DC in the cloud? - If that is possible, does this mean I am not fully cloud-based domain environment, or can I then also have an on-prem spun up later?\n  \nI am sure there are some bright minds out there to help navigate this mess.\n Thank you!!!!\n    submitted by    /u/SomePen7659  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Almost a year ago, my manager let me know he was going to be moving to another team and my department director would like to promote me to my manager's position. Nice! Over the following months this shifted to, \"we have to post the position and you'll need to apply, but you're our candidate of choice.\" Interviews were earlier this month and I didn't make it past the first round of interviews. My director pulled me aside afterwards to say that I interviewed well, but he had decided to look for someone with more experience. It sucks but business can be that way, I'll just keep my resume updated.\n ​\n Later, it was dropped that the new manager won't be meeting with our team at any point during the interview process. This manager will also report to two directors; during my interview it became clear they had directly opposing ideas of what the new manager should achieve, (director 1 said it would be the new manger's job to take on work from their team and say no to new work from director 2, director 2 said exactly the opposite), and it very much gave me \"divorced parents arguing through the kids\" vibes.\n ​\n After thinking about this for a bit, I never would entertain an offer like this if it had come from another organization. If I was applying for a manager role and couldn't meet the team at least once and was expected to report to multiple directors with directly opposing expectations, I never would consider the role!\n ​\n While it sucks that I was strung along for so long, I'm grateful that it helped me see that this probably wasn't a position I would be happy with, and that a healthy organization probably wouldn't make these kinds of decisions.\n    submitted by    /u/garthand_ur  \n [link]   [comments]",

Except they get so mad when I ask them to make sure their username/password is correct, or if their cable is in properly or if they're trying to log into the right platform. People don't understand resolving IT issues isn't always instantaneous and sometimes we need to wait for equipment to be delivered. It seems that I'm often expected to resolve everything Right Now and people get frustrated and upset when that doesn't happen. \n It's a bit overwhelming to be honest, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything. I got 3 day of training before the last sysadmin left. I'm not sure how you guys deal with people who are rude/impatient/irritated.

I was stagnant in my previous line of work and wanted to try something new (I’m in my mid 30s). In a few years, I’ve learned a LOT, obtained the triad of CompTIA certs, VMware cert, CCNA, and some Azure certs. I assist in managing our VIP clients, and have been promoted 4 times to get near the top of the food chain on the help desk (about 50 of us).\n I love the type of work I do and it just clicks for me, but a huge downside for me is OT. I understand there is OT for every position out there. That’s part and parcel of work. But the daily 1-3 hours (and weekends) of maintenance and troubleshooting the inevitable issues that arise from that work each night is just something I will not continue to do. Give me 40-42 hours a week. Take your money. I want the time off, away from the office. I’m not going to spend 12 hours a day working when I have a wife and 2 kids at home. It’s just too much, I’m burnt out quickly, and I can’t give my family my full, undivided attention they deserve on a daily basis.\n Are there any options out there for me that I can work my way to that is a more traditional “9-5” job in the IT world? When I’m done for the day, I want to leave my work at work. Obviously a sysadmin role at a company is out of the question. Am I more suited for a solutions role or pre sales? Sales?

Right now all of our users have local admin rights on their work devices which is a security risk we would like to mitigate.\n Points to consider are:\n  \nstraight forward administration of the tool\n the tool should be easy to understand for the user\n there should be a way to evaluate who / when / how long someone requsted local admin rights\n it should be possible to determine the duration of the requested admin rights\n Company of about 200 - 300 users\n We are using Microsoft 365 E3\n  \nQuestions we asked ourselves are:\n  \nWhy do coworkers actually need local admin rights?\n can the tool / software be automatically be updated with our images without admin rights?\n can devicedrivers still be installed with manufacturer tools like Dell SupportAssist?\n  \nAs it stands right now in my research on the subject i stumbled upon the tool EAM (Emergency Admin Manager) from dynasys, which looks kind of promising.\n I was curious if any of you have a useful suggestion or better solution to my problem at hand (im still fairly inexperienced and just started my first job)\n im grateful for any help, thank you very much!\n    submitted by    /u/EqualAd7033  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve done this but they’ll take a few days to get back to me (which over Christmas will likely take a bit longer)\n https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/e3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab\n Are there any other ways of spinning up this tenant without engaging a human?\n I’ve noticed E3 Business subscriptions can be done directly from the portal. Can I just sign up for this and then upgrade?

In the last two years there's been a lot of turnover and current folks just aren't into it damn kids.\n So after sneakily gathering intel for the last two months I've gathered that they ALL like to play minecraft. Surprise!\n So, tomorrow as a end of the year gift the company will be playing a Ya-dead-ya-dead minecraft game in a server I spent today building. We're confident most employees have already purchased the game but I've gotten an approved PO to purchase a personal copy for any employee who doesn't so they can join in, and it's theirs. Ties to their personal accounts. \n I spent the day preparing a full java minecraft package, to deploy at 11:59pm tonight to all systems, and have a custom message that will be pushed at 10am directing users play some minecraft and join xyz server. \n Once they join everyone will start at a specified point with some messages to read regarding the \"game\". They'll have the entier day to build the most elaborate home + an attempt to reach \"the end\". Most likely nobody will get there as its hardcore. Also, if you die you're dead. They've all been provided a named box with the same supplies to help them get started, food and a map.\n Its not much but I'm really happy I was able to get this approved and am able to give the company a few hours of fun before the holidays.\n Any ideas on change to the theme of the game for more fun? I thought YDYD would lead to good braging rights theme. We do have some sales, Admin, and HR folks but they're already all GONE for the holiday. It's literally just a bunch of very young devs and myself for tomorrow.\n    submitted by    /u/Shaggy_The_Owl  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have to do after-hours support every three weeks for a full week. They are not going to pay us though. We have to volunteer. Now, in IT we've all canceled family vacations and lost money on plane tickets, yada yada.. It's not just happening to me personally, it's my team. My direct manager is great, and so is my IT director. They are very good human beings. I can't stress that enough. Mr. Rogers's territory nice. \"Good people\" if you're from the American Midwest. You know what that term means.\n I got a Teams call today from HR. I had used the F word in an email to my wife on 19 Dec 2023 at 0759 EST. I have a company phone and I had used a company phone to say the F-word in an email. OK fine. I violated company policy. I will endeavor to be mindful in the future when using my mobile phone, not to say the F-word or any other word that people find offensive. That list gets updated yearly. \n I said to the HR rep \" you called to chew me out about email usage, but a multi-billion dollar company is refusing to pay the IT department overtime when we actually work overtime? Can you see why I might be upset? You are not solving problems, you're just making problems up. You never just say thank you to us\".

          "description": "I work for an engineering company that is testing some cellular modems. These modems need to hit internal systems for testing. The IPs of the cellular modems change frequently - within restarts or days - so having a trusted IP list in the access list won't work. Most of the services being hit from the NAT rule require some sort of authentication. However, this is for test engineers who have no reason to consider security. Along with that, they may be testing on an OS or services that have known vulnerabilities. \n I've been contemplating this for a few days and the only thing I can think of is to put the test VMs on a small private VLAN so their at least contained. On top of that, I figure I may as well add a list of trusted IPs based on the cellular network they are using to at least be somewhat explicit on the access list. However, with my ignorance of how their systems work, there is still the possibility of a bad actor exploiting some vulnerability and possibly getting some sort of foothold and/or company IP. This would be a very targeted attack, but I have to consider the possibility.\n Does anyone have any experience with supporting something like this or have a better idea on how to enable the engineers to get their jobs done while still keeping the company internal network secure along with any IP on the test systems?\n TL;DR: Engineers need to have cellular modems connect to systems on our internal network. My thought is a basic NAT rule allowing any outside connection to that IP:PORT for port forwarding to their systems which I put on a private VLAN.\n    submitted by    /u/BitteringAgent  \n [link]   [comments]",

SMB on the other hand works almost flawlessly though. Problem B) Every traffic from within the network actually doesnt seem to be steady and this behaves in a repeating pattern: it goes from fast to mediocre or even halts every few seconds goes back to full speed and then repeats this behavior after a a few seconds. It’s the same from outside the Network, downloading or uploading from/to the entire network: Client will actually see these interferences aswell.\n After everything I’ve tried I think I narrowed it down to UDP and probably one of the two switches in the network. IPerf between peers and/or NAS or other clients or servers: everything seems fine - except for UDP. Cant establish a connection. Netcat UDP works between all machines except one though : on that specific machine Netcat only works exactly ONCE and then loses (or closes?) the connection immediately. I had good NFS results with a test-share on the NAS when I explicitly disabled UDP + I don’t allow Sync - resulting in up to 1GB/s read and write to the NAS. (SMB is at about 600MB/s) MTU is 1500 everywhere. Turned off Auto-Negotiation and Flow Control everywhere. \n Any ideas what this could be?

Here are the results:\n ACI NOT Cisco - 4,344 \n Nexus Dashboard - 3 (All from Cisco)\n Arista CVP NOT Arista Networks - 4,145 \n NSX - 1,533 \n Apstra NOT Juniper Networks - 5 (3 of those were from \"Juniper Apstra\" so it's really 2 jobs)\n EVPN - 385\n VXLAN - 743 \n ​\n I feel like you all owe /u/bmcgahan an apology. Cisco is a vendor people love to hate on. Yes their licensing and certain marketing practices are despicable, but there seems to be a market out there for ACI, contrary to what people are saying. \n After this brief search, I plan to spend some time to learn more about the solution and see where the opportunities might be.\n Edit: Also to be fair and for context, Cisco is a behemoth of a marketing machine with many more feet on the ground when it comes to sales, so naturally their numbers are expected to be bigger. It doesn't mean other vendor solutions are better or worse.\n    submitted by    /u/Sea_Inspection5114  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry I'm going to be ranting a little bit, but perhaps we can also start a discussion.\n I recently had to work with a bunch of RJ45 connectors that had boots as shown in the picture:\n Awful boot\n And it was a somewhat frustrating experience. Not TOO bad, but I must say that is the dumbest connector boot design ever, and it's really popular for some reason.\n Here's why it's terrible. The flaps on the sides. I understand they are there to prevent the tab getting snagged on something. But they're not actually guaranteed to work for that because something can still technically get in between them and snag the tab.\n But by far the worst thing about them is that you cannot easily press the tab and release the connector. It's actually quite annoying, even when you figure out the best way to do it, you still can't quite get a good push on the tab and it often feels like you're scraping the connector as you're pulling the cable out.\n Every other design has realized this, so they have the anti-snag thing go over the tab so you can press on it directly and release the cable, also guaranteeing the tab will never get snagged. Easy, sensible, works. But whoever designed this boot was too stupid to realize this, did they even test their creation once? And then for some reason it caught on and is now quite a popular design.\n Am I missing something? It's terrible, right? I know I'm overreacting, but what are you gonna do... first world problems.\n Edit: Reading the comments, I guess I this is actually one of the nicer designs when you consider how god awful some of the other ones are, ending up under the tab or hardening over time... I just hate not being able to easily get my finger in between the flaps to press the tabs and now I see that it can be so much worse... LOL.

I took some time out to dabble in cybersecurity tool integrations, however the only time I was really happy in that role was working with the network shops on the customer side, helping them configure, troubleshoot, and sharing knowledge along the way. So I decided to make a move back into networking. The welcome was warm and I quickly found a new home.\n So my question for the field - is GNS3 still the hotness when it comes to network modeling and plain old CLI practice? I need to get smart on Cisco DC in a hurry, and already targeted CCNP DC since the new environment is heavy on Nexus 9k infrastructure with a sizeable SAN. All of the campus networks are Catalyst 9k.

One thing we want to still be able to do is use our network tester to plug in to a port in the facility to trace it back to the network port in case someone moves to a different location.

Long-story short, these devices transmit/access sensitive info and we'd like to make sure their traffic is handled as such. We are setting up a vendor VPN server that will encrypt traffic between those devices and the traffic's destination. The VPN configures an always-on virtual NIC and virtual IP on these devices; the assignment pool can be any of our choosing.\n Our firewall has a subinterface for VLAN 405, which is on a /30 network with the cellular provider's router. That then communicates with any devices on 405. My question is, if these devices now get fancy new virtual IPs from a completely different range (let's say 192.168.1.0), how will traffic flow be affected? Will I need to create a new VLAN and/or subinterface in addition to new access rules in order for traffic from these devices to continue to be allowed? Or can I just configure access rules to allow the new range on the existing subinterface?

For our local sites this has been fairly simple as we can enable P2P blocking for the group of APs and be done with it. Unfortunately for Flex Connect sites, this function only works on a per AP basis and is a known limitation. This means that a client on AP1 cannot talk to another client on AP1, but can talk to a client on AP2.\n I've been experimenting a bit with private Vlans as I have a theory that if the APs are in isolated Vlans then they cannot talk to each other and the P2P block should work for the APs themselves, but testing has been slow and there's doubts this could work for our environment on a larger scale. \n Curious to hear what solutions your teams have come up with to enable client isolation. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/SPNCER  \n [link]   [comments]",

Will also run VRRP and vPC between the switches.\n Three servers connected to both switches\n SVI:s (default gateways for the VLANs) will be terminated on the firewall\n Internet will terminate on the switches. \n Only one ISP circuit, they will handoff two ports from their wan switch, each physical cable will be connected to each switch. \n  \n​\n Now to my question, since the SVI/gateways for the servers will be terminated on the firewall, how will I then configure the VRRP on the switches? The way I've been configuring VRRP before, I always configured the SVI:s and VRRP on the same \"equipment\" (switch/router etc) if that makes sense.. \n So for example, let say we have vlan 200 and a subnet of: 10.200.10.0/24 and I want to configure VRRP on the switches:\n SW1:\n Interface vlan 200\n ip addr 10.200.10.1/24\n vrrp 1 ip 10.200.10.99\n vrrp 1 prio 120\n preempt\n etc... \n SW2:\n Interface vlan 200\n ip addr 10.200.10.2/24\n vrrp 1 ip 10.200.10.99\n preempt\n etc...\n Now, this is if the SVI:s would be terminated on the switches. But I would like to terminate the SVI:s on the firewall and not on the switch. Taking that approach (terminating SVI:s on the firewall): from the switch, I will just create a L2 VLAN and trunk it to the firewall. \n ​\n I know of course that I do not want to terminate the SVI:s on the firewall, I could just terminate the SVIs on the switch and then run VRRP on the switches as well, but I would like to know if what I ask is doable, if so, how and why? \n I could overthink this but please, help me to understand it. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/donutspro  \n [link]   [comments]",

This approach poses a security risk, given that if this one document is leaked, the entire network is compromised. Another problem I've seen is that usually they just distribute the admin password to everyone working on the NOC, and so we've encountered a few people doing misconfiguration and also the need to change the master password once that employee leaves the ISP. I've thought about implementing a Radius based approach, where every user would get their own login and password, but I do not know of any \"radius manager\" (let's call it that).

Just seeing a multitude of SYNs from the clients, and never any SYN+ACK from the server.\n We set a SPAN up directly on the server’s ports and see the SYNs egressing towards the server, and no SYN+ACK ingressing, we effectively proved traffic is making it all the way to the server, and the server is not responding to the traffic.\n After a while the ticket comes back to us saying the app owner had a call with the support vendor and they found nothing wrong and wanted the network checked for blocks.\n Same situation on second look, all SYNs no responses. This time we did some troubleshooting on the server itself and NETSTAT showed an anomaly. It showed ESTABLISHED connections with all of the clients trying to reach it, on the port they’re sending on…\n How is this possible?

I'd also then be responsible for creating and giving presentations about what our recommendations are, creating detailed designs and implementation plans and then be the primary technical POC during proof-of-concept implementations. There would be lots of client interaction, lots of face time, and at least 20% travel with the rest being fully remote. Lots of creating documentation & designs, and then sometimes assisting (at a high level) with implementation.\n All of this sounds great to me, at least on paper. It's the stuff that I love doing, without as much of the drudgery of day-to-day tickets. I spend my entire day already elbow-deep in this specific vendors products anyway, so if anything I'd have to go even deeper into their product offerings across the board.\n The compensation numbers being tossed about are . . . uh, generous to say the least.

          "description": "I have a guy that connects to a meraki client VPN - once he connects he's had all sorts of strange issues. To start out, and it might be the issue, whoever setup this network set it in a public range. 192.158.x.x\n Once he connects, he can ping the servers ip address and it gets a response (192.158.x.9) but he cannot Telnet to the same address.\n I'm on his home computer remotely, once he connects to the VPN, i lose my connection and don't get it back until he disconnects. He also can't get to the website to initiate a new connection but CAN still connect to other things on the internet.\n I ran wireshark on the server and can see the ping requests and replies but I see NOTHING when attempted a telnet connection. I've completely turned off the firewall on both machines to see if thats the issue, and it didn't help. \n a \"powershell test-netconnection\" to the server on port 23 fails\n I've connected to his VPN using the same settings from my computer and I can telnet to the server just fine.\n I've connected to his VPN using the same settings from his old home computer and I can telnet to the server just fine.\n I've restarted and ran windows updates and it still doesn't work. I checked the firewall rules on the meraki and its set to allow all. There are some OLD 1:1 nat rules having to do with port 23 but that shouldn't have anything to do with a vpn connection.\n ​\n I'm stumped. I don't know why this machine wont work and a machine on the same home network works fine connecting the same way.

The network diagram is here. When I try to connect to Wi-Fi it never obtains an IP address. I can, however, turn on the hotspot on my Pixel 6 Pro and it will connect. The hotspot is set for WPA2-Personal\n ​\n  \nThe FD150 supports WPA-AES, WPA-TKIP, and WPA2-AES. I’m not trying to use anything other than WP2-AES\n The WAPs support WPA2-Personal, WPA3-Personal, and WPA-Enterprise. I don’t have/want a RADIUS server, so enterprise is out. I’ve set the WAPs to use WPA2-Personal.\n My believe is that WPA2-Personal and WPA2-AES are the same thing. WPA2-Personal uses AES.\n I’m trying to connect the credit card machine to VLAN30. Other PCs using that VLAN via a different SSID, but same WAP have no problem obtaining an IP address and accessing the internet. I have tried the FD150 connecting to the same SSID as the other PCs – still doesn’t work.\n  \nI’m working on a method to Wireshark the Wi-Fi packets but finding an adapter that supports monitor mode is not as easy as I thought it would be.\n Am I wrong about the equivalence of WPA2-AES and WPA2-Personal\n Does anybody see anything I’m doing wrong that I’ve missed?

A whole bunch of them have Nintendo Switches and I also have one at hand, however they will not connect to the internet through our \"WPA Personal\" Ubiquiti SSID. (Nintendo Switches are simply incompatible with \"WPA Enterprise\" which we use for our main Wi-Fi network) They connect to the network with the password but throw back the message \"Registration is required to use this network\" when trying to connect to the internet. I HAVE done research but I can't find any actual solutions. Other Universities appear to collect MAC Addresses from the students and just add them manually which is no problem but I haven't the slightest idea where to do this after gathering the device's MAC Addresses.\n I think either our WatchGuard firewall or RADIUS is causing the problem but maybe I've missed a setting in the SSID setup I really don't know. I have full access to every server, everything. I just haven't a clue what to do with the Nintendo Switch's MAC Address to get it to connect to the internet :(\n Currently, I have a test \"Nintendo\" SSID on the nearest access point to me which I plan to use to troubleshoot the issue further. If I can get it to work here though I'll push it out to the other 80 access points.\n Willing to follow any guidance and answer any questions. I hope someone has come across this before.

There's no internal website, no guest access, no cellular backup, no real filtering needing, etc.\n They are being asked to pay over $5,000 to renew their Meraki license and in the short term, this is a tough request for them, especially as the Meraki hardware is over 6 years old, if not older (the switches are nearing end of support dates), so it may need to be replaced soon anyways.\n It seems that they could get by with Ubiquiti or Aruba Instant On hardware for much less, and work with a local IT company for support on a much cheaper level if they need it and I'm no longer able to help.\n Am I looking at this wrong?\n    submitted by    /u/NeatDescription8  \n [link]   [comments]",

At least that was the case for me. \n ​\n Anyway, onto the configuration : \n ip access-list ipExclude \n permit icmp any any\n ​\n class-map type qos match-all ipExclude\n match access-group name ipExclude\n ​\n ​\n policy-map type qos ipExclude\n class type qos ipExclude\n set qos-group 2\n class type qos class-default\n set qos-group 0\n ​\n system qos\n service-policy type qos input ipExclude\n ​\n class-map type queuing DILITRUST-OUTPUT\n match qos-group 2\n ​\n ​\n policy-map type queuing DILISTRUST-COS\n class type queuing DILITRUST-OUTPUT\n bandwidth percent 50\n class type queuing class-default\n bandwidth percent 50\n shape kbps 5000\n ​\n Interface Ethernet1/12\n service-policy type queuing output DILISTRUST-COS\n ​\n Of course, this doesn't work and i tried multiples things but i just don't get how it doesn't work. ICMP packets should normally be tagged with the qos-group 2 and all the rest of the traffic with the default qos-group 0 and therefore, not be shaped as per the first class DILITRUST-OUTPUT once it matches on it. \n ​\n But no, it doesn't work. Any network engineer here might have an idea?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/filding  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did design 1 and he did design 2.\n Proposed design-1\n Proposed design 2: https://imgur.com/Eu1tsbn\n The customer have: two fortigate firewalls, two switches and three physical servers for their new network setup.\n Basically, the only difference is the internet connection between my design and my colleague design. He preferred that the internet terminated on the switches instead of the firewall compared to my design (internet terminated directly on the firewall). Unfortunately, he could not explain why (yeah I know.. he said that he have seen lot of customer going for design 2) and I've been trying to research about this but no luck.\n I would like if someone here know why the design 2 is preferred more than design 1. I know that it all depends on the requirements etc.. but just in general, if you would look at both designs, which one would you go for and why? I'm curious and would like to know both the pros and the cons for both design.\n ​\n Appreciate all your answers.\n ​\n EDIT: For whatever reason, I have issues naming the links from imgur so I will just post the URL for design 2. Apologize for that\n EDIT 2: there is only one ISP link and will just be a default route to the ISP (no BGP).

The interesting thing is that the networking (and firewall) is provided by a different company with the core being in an entirely different locale. The good news is that in our building, we have a switch in the basement with a few ports that assign WAN IPs. \n Using this, I set up a pfSense firewall and hooked up to WAN and LAN. At Site B we have a UniFi USG4. I set up an IPSec tunnel between the two, and got as far as being able to resolve the Windows domain from Site B, and ping the (real) LAN gateway but not any further. NO domain controller traffic was able to pass. \n Basically my thoughts were that since I have access to both a WAN IP, and the local subnet that 99% of our Windows machines are on, I had everything I needed to create a tunnel from inside of the other company's network and get our Site B network connected to resources that Site A uses WITHOUT asking the other company to make any changes.

          "description": "I’m a vaguely technical project manager (so apologies if some of the terminology is wrong) and I’m curious about what a future enterprise network might look like. Today we have a fairly traditional on-prem design. 2 data centres, some public facing services, VMware, F5 load balancers, mostly Cisco everything else including core switches.\n At each site we have MPLS, and local internet breakout from the same provider as the MPLS. We have Cisco L3 edge switches, and Cisco wireless access points managed via controllers at the DCs. All internet traffic goes out via the local break out, not over the MPLS.\n Most of our end user and public facing services are already in the cloud, with the rest moving over the next 3 years. And the data centres will reduce to a couple of racks of legacy internal and public facing systems.\n Endpoint security will be on the devices (zScaler), and the view is that the office network will end up no more trusted than any other network.\n At that point in 3 years time, my questions are why do we need a WAN, why do we need core switches and routing or expensive MPLS circuits? Then why do we need L3 edge switches?\n In my simple mind we would need reliable managed internet access and WiFi with a management platform. Not even sure if we need much wired Ethernet except for printers and a few other appliances. Everyone has laptops and we don’t have desk phones. Mostly normal Microsoft Office based workloads.\n So would we effectively be no different to a rent-an-office location? What equipment and management tooling do they use? Still Cisco?\n Thanks for indulging me!\n    submitted by    /u/a4333387775  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am using Python to automate configuration commands to Adtran OLT network devices. Currently, the app mostly works in the sense of being able to issue commands to retrieve information tables for parsing.\n The problem I'm up against is when I start sending commands back to apply configuration changes, something very weird happens with the CLI which I can replicate exactly through my Gnome Terminal by pasting the same commands that break in the automated interactive shell.\n Here is an example of the command set where the problem starts:\n enable config t shaper “interface gpon 1/0/1@1/4/1.gpon channel 1” 1@1/4/1.gpon rate 500000 exit shaper “remote-device 1@1/4/1.gpon_0” 1/4 rate 500000 exit exit \n For reasons unknown to me, once the space after the second double quote is sent, the shell does something weird and the command breaks as invalid.\n Here is a visual example of what happens to the CLI in Gnome Terminal which is essentially the same result I see with the automated shell as well: https://imgur.com/a/Id8snAA\n The automated shell is currently using a vt100 terminal type if that helps any. For the record, the command examples provide have been tested directly through a shell on a macOS computer and they work as intended there so the command format is where it should be.\n Any takers on what I'm missing here?\n    submitted by    /u/TesNikola  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I was only using a single vlan on layer 2, I'd just connect access ports on each switch to carry the same vlan between the switches.

This server lives on their one and only ESX vSphere host, on VLAN 100. Mind you, there’s about 15 other servers on this VLAN 100 network that were working just fine.\n VLAN 100 lives on the core switches, with the VIP being 10.64.100.1/23 shared between both switches, and .2 and .3 physical IPs living on switch 1 and switch 2 respectively. So .100.1 is the default gateway for all the virtual servers. \n Their ESX host connects to the switches via a port channel that participates in MLAG, and carry’s all vlans across it. \n Now the issue we were seeing on this single server (which was address .100.147) was that it was not installing arp entries correctly. It was unable to ping its default gateway (.100.1) and ONLY had an arp entry for .100.3, which is the physical IP for VLAN 100 on switch 2. All other servers were correctly installing the arp entry for the VIP .100.1 as expected, but this single server was the only one not properly handling ARP entries. \n Any ideas on this one? I’m quite new to using VRRP / MLAG so i wasn’t sure of any possible limitations, or what i should be looking for in vCenter or on the VM settings. \n Any help would be appreciated!

I have been working for an ISP and we mainly used BGP for everything so it's been a while since I used either of those protocols. I nailed every BGP question btw.\n They also ask me about switching, firewalls and how to tshoot high latency problems. In all of those questions I think I did great so idk.

          "description": "Preface: Yeah, I know. \"Don't span L2\". This is one potential option for a migration from a legacy network in an industrial environment, not a traditional enterprise environment. There are options to migrate to a routed design but it would be significantly more work so I'm considering this option as well. \n For the topology, imagine 50 routers with wifi and ethernet interfaces (bridged), connected in client mode to a backhaul wifi mesh. The same subnet should be available on ethernet behind all of them. Minimal performance requirements means it doesn't matter if they all terminate at a single hub and have to route through the hub every time to reach each other.\n My first thought was EVPN/VXLAN over IPSEC tunnels in a hub and spoke setup, however I don't think the Cisco IR1821 (which is otherwise perfect for this design) supports EVPN. I may try to find the minimum device that supports it and see if it fits the budget because its fairly standard at this point.\n Next was L2TPv3 but it appears to be point to point only, i.e., the hub could only have a L2 pseudowire terminate with one other device.\n Just bridging ethernet onto the mesh and encrypting the mesh isn't an option unfortunately.\n Are there any options I'm missing? \n To avoid an XY problem: the only requirements are that layer 2 traverses the backhaul network, encrypted/terminated by well-known-ish-vendor devices we control (not the mesh itself). Bonus points if the terminating devices include the wifi radio because it removes a point of failure.\n    submitted by    /u/Substantial-Guava  \n [link]   [comments]",

I realise this is somewhat intrusive, but I'm tring to convince management not to install employee tracking software on all user machines, so is a kind of a lesser evil.\n This is for deployment into GCP/AWS for a remote working environment where all machines are to be auto-joined to a VPN at boot, likely using tailscale, but this has not been finalized yet.. i.e. we could consider an all in one solution, if one exists.\n Any recommendations would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/woleium  \n [link]   [comments]",

Essentially, we have a VPN gateway in it's own vNET, peered with this, is a hub vNET which peers with many other vNETs in a hub/spoke topology. The VPN gateway vNET and other vNETs are spoke connections connected to the hub.\n ​\n We need the ability to have inbound connections from our other spoke vNETs to be NATTed to addresses on the VPN Gateway's vNET. \n For example:\n User VDI vNET: 10.10.10.0/24\n ​\n VPN Gateway vNET: 10.100.0.0/24\n VPN Gateway Route: 10.100.10.0/24\n ​\n As traffic is being sent through the VPN Gateway to 10.100.10.0/24, All inbound addresses from 10.10.10.0/24 need to be mapped to an address in 10.100.0.0/24\n Conversely, Inbound connections from 10.100.10.0/24 to 10.100.0.0/24 need to be able to return to 10.10.10.0/24\n ​\n After spending a good amount of time reading documentation and creating a test environment to validate this, I've not been successful. Unless i'm reading something incorrectly, it appears that only the VPN Gateway vNET itself can be NATTed to a new address. \n ​\n Is there a design constraint here with VPN Gateway or this there another design constraint that needs to be considered?\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Equivalent_Hope5015  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been doing quite a bit of research regarding design and deployment best practices, but I have a few questions that I'd like your thoughts about.\n Thus far my Ipv6 addressing plan is to assigned /64 to all service provider infrastructure, such as customer facing interfaces and VLANs, /56 for PD, and /127 for p2p segments.\n  \nIn accordance with RFC 6177, I'll plan on assigning /56 prefixes to customer end sites using DHCPv6-PD. When a customer site receives a PD, how does my PE router know what interface to route the assigned PD prefix towards the customer? I'm not sure if this is vendor specific, but let's assume I'm using Windows Server for DHCPv6 server and my PE is a Cisco Catalyst 9500.\n \nWhen a customer wants public Ipv4 space from us we usually just allocate a /29 and statically route that prefix to the customers IP on the p2p segment. Is this methodology considered best practice for Ipv6 also? \n \n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ZNastyyy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyhoo, I mainly work on PON systems and the corresponding CPE that we deploy at sites. What I am struggling at the moment with that I am trying to solve is that we currently have the Calix Cloud services to onboard and monitor the Calix Routers we deploy along with some Nokia Beacons from a prior agreement that I am trying to pass down a DHCP statement to onboard them into the TR-069 server without the Calix routers having to phone home first to get their TR-069 address because that takes forever and the Nokias want to phone home to their native address that is burned into the firmware which is what I want to avoid. I've already created my class statement in the DHCP server config matching the OUI of all the models we deployed but when it comes to the subnet pool statement, I either have the option of only allowing members of the class to get a DHCP lease from the pool or I can issue a \"allow unkown-clients\" statement which pushed the option 43 statement to all devices in that pool.

We really love them and have no issue so far.\n I have to setup a few temporary remote branches, but I don't have the budget for aruba switches.\n The remote branches would each be about MAX 10 workstations with a 10GB single mode fiber uplink, so a single 16 port switch should be enough.\n Can you recommend a low cost solution (<500$) for a 16 port switch with 10GB uplink that would be manageable with CLI(SSH) (we only need layer 2 for VLAN and MSTP). No power redundancy is required. And most importantly, that would have no issue with the Aruba uplink? I know it should be industry standard, but I've been bitten a lot of times by low cost solutions in the past, and I prefer not to lose time.\n I found the D-Link DGS-1510 line, but I have no idea what it is worth management wide, as I never touched anything else than main vendors (Cisco, Juniper, Arista and HPE/Aruba).\n The aruba uplink is a 6300 (JL658A).

Multiple sites connected over a Metro E connection. Would a hub and spoke or a point to point be better for this application. I would think a hub and spoke would be best due to limiting the broadcast seen by other switches. To give you an idea of my network, on a daily basis I sit at roughly 14,000 devices. I think a hub and spoke is the way to go due to limiting traffic on the incoming interfaces to what is destined to that router. The switches all share the same native vlan 300 (no IPs exist). Each individual site and the shared core have a unique vlan (vlan 30x) with their own /30 between the two. \n Even though they all share the same metro e, am I correct in saying a hub and spoke separated by vlans (30x) would be better then all of the sites sharing the same vlan (300)? The sites really dont have a reason to communicate between each other.

I've verified that all algorithms match up perfectly along with DH and autokey time. The VPN profile is a carbon copy of all of my other sites but this is the only one that has any issue.\n My setup from the branch to the data center is Fortigate (Station FW) -> Cradle point Modem (LTE) -> Palo Alto (Data center FW).

To be honest being able to host something on a VM would be the best option, but even a dedicated appliance is way better than what they have currently.\n ​\n About 50-60 mobile clients, mostly RDP connections- that's really about it.\n    submitted by    /u/iamadapperbastard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For the past 5 years we been dealing with terrible internet access from Spectrum Business. A week does not goes by with out us having to reset our cable modem or/and deal with a couple minutes outages, sometimes even hours. We are subscribed to the 600/35 plan. I have always wanted more upload speeds so we started looking for a fiber connection.\n After contacting 3 ISP I narrow it down to two companies. One is offering 1gbps symmetrical from one of their nearby PON for $489 no SLA, this connection is not dedicated, but the sales person claims that the PON is not currently being used by any other company and this has been the case for years, he even claimed (and I actually believed this) this should remain the case since the types of businesses in my street are not the type to required these speeds or reliability. The second company is able to provide a dedicated fiber line to their datacenter, after weeks of negotiation I was able to get them to come down to $730 a month for 1gbps with a 99.999% SLA. Both connections requires a 48 months agreement. Honestly we dont need this level of connection but we could really use the upload speeds to run our own cloud storage solution (nextcloud, plex, databackup services) and couple other things. in reality a 100x100mbps connection is sufficient but the price at that point wouldn't be substantially lower since they need to recover their construction cost.\n My question is, under these circumstances would you pay $241 more to have the dedicated connection with a SLA and guaranteed speeds, latency and data packet loss? or should I just save the money and go with the cheaper solution.

Of course with the 1010's, Cisco must assume all of their customers manage a single, local branch, because they don't let you use crypto commands until you register with the Smart portal to unlock strong encryption (you know, that thing that was preloaded on all the 5500 series firewalls since the PIX's went EOL???). So that means I have to wait until the site connects it to the WAN cable to get internet before I can register it and unlock VPN commands, which the business won't run without. Even worse is when it needs to go to a country in another timezone. On the 5506's I used to be able to just preconfigure the VPN, ship it and tell the on site guy to move the cables over when he starts his day in his timezone and all will work. No no. Now Cisco wants me to wake up at 2am (8am for the site the ASA is getting installed at) so I can register with them, and THEN...only then will they let me register and be granted permission to unlock crypto commands. Scum.\n Today this scenario happened for me, but the Smart Portal is spitting traceback errors at me, and as a result, I can't view my inventory or create new license tokens, which means I can't register the 1010 to be able to put the VPN's up, and had to roll everything back. \n Come on Cisco. Your ASA customers are NOT Fisher Price engineers managing one location, and nobody that buys an ASA is doing so for their home. Yet you insist on making things easier for residential and mom/pop shop operations and harder for enterprise/commercial grade large multi-location international companies with every new generation of hardware.\n    submitted by    /u/TheFaytalist  \n [link]   [comments]",

It takes some work to explain. \n For context, I took over at my location about nine months ago. We recently had a scheduled power outage at our location. Our primary devices were on generators to prevent them from shutting down. Other devices around the location did get powered off. \n Our core switch is a Ruckus ICX7650-48F. After power was restored, I cannot ssh into any Cisco switch directly connected to the core. Any HP/Aruba device directly connected works with SSH and ping. The same is true for any cisco device downstream from an HP/Aruba. \n Although this is happening, everything around the site is running fine from an operational standpoint. We have wireless and all ethernet working. \n We have a Cisco 3650 directly below the core in the rack that I've been troubleshooting. When I checked spanning-tree on it, I noticed a VLAN ID mismatch with two different VLANs. Our management VLAN and the Trunk VLAN. Nothing has changed in the configuration, and I've double checked that there isn't a mismatch like it says. I get this error with all Cisco switches. \n I've done quite a bit of troubleshooting and need more ideas.

          "description": "Hi Everyone,\n We have an IPsec VPN connection for a client which worked fine, however client installed a firewall (cisco firepower 1120) and since the install, we cannot reach the other end. The VPN tunnel is created but we cannot reach the other side of the firewall. And I cannot see any traffic hitting the firewall. The client router is a Four-Faith F3424 and the VPN server Router is a dreytek vigor2920. The client router is in \"gateway\" mode, and in the network settings the gateway IP is the outside interface of the firewall. We have acl and nat set up to allow the client router port to inside. I can ping the client router from the server router and PC, but not the firewall. I tried trace route, but when I try to reach the other side of the firewall it looks like it does not go through the VPN tunnel. And I cannot ping the outside Interface of the firewall, however ping is allowed for testing. I upload a logical diagram, we would like to RDP from PC-A to PC-B. When I RDP i just enter 192.168.1.6 and it worked before the firewall, now the other side of the tunnel is on another subnet 192.168.50.0 Any suggestions? Should I switch the client router to router mode and create a static route? Why can't I see traffic on the firewall? . \n Logical drawing: https://imgbox.com/XxGMkMOi\n    submitted by    /u/kozi1200  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I know it would be difficult, as you don't have control over the cell tower like you would over your home or business's router, but if you can receive what other phones or cellular capable devices are transmitting couldn't you be able read what is in the packets just like you can in a Wi-Fi network, as you are connected to them? Or is a different encryption key used by each device? And as I haven't been able to find much online, could someone link some information on the encryption methods used on cellular networks? \n I have one more thing that needs clearing up about cellular networks. What exactly assigns your IP address, is it something at the cell site, meaning your address changes as you change towers? Or is something else responsible for that? And how is data routed to the cell tower, how does it know that your data is intended for it, does it have it's own IP address? If so how does it know in the case of mobile calls and SMS, because as far as I am aware those don't travel over the internet?

On the user's device, the client software also creates an outbound tunnel to the Zscaler cloud. The two tunnels are stitched together by the Zscaler Service Edge. For each client-to-app connection, there is a separate micro-tunnel pair.\n I think Azure AD Application Proxy works in similar way except instead of client software it's just the client's web browser.

The router has an adapter configured for 172.16.31.10, and a DHCP service to serve IPs on that address. It is bridged to the host ethernet adapter (set to 172.16.31.9) which goes via a switch to a Ruckus WLC, which is connected to an access point. Currently I can connect to the wireless network provided by the WLC, but my PC does not get an IP address on that network at all. The address for the configuration interface on the WLC is 192.168.10.14. Does this need to be set to the 172.16.31.x subnet, and if so should the gateway be the vyos router address? I can only find articles that explain WLCs from a high level, or in depth configuration guides for specific WLCs that assume an in depth knowledge of networking (which I do not have.. only some basics). My current understanding is that the vyos router should serve up IP addresses via the host (since it is bridged) and then the WLC should 'pass that' via the access point to my PC. Since it isn't working I'm guessing that is incorrect, but I don't have enough knowledge yet to know where to start looking for the issue or how to trace it.

I run EIGRP between the MPLS PE and my core so that when the routes go down that traffic is then routed out the default gateway. This works great for when users were in the office but with the shift to remote/hybrid its causing some voice quality issues for remote users.\n Users have been told to use the tunnel all option to force that voice traffic through the VPN and across the MPLS. Obviously tunneling all their traffic is less than ideal and we get a fair amount of complaints about slow downloads and poor voice quality. We do have split-tunneling but that sends that voice traffic out their local gateways and that can be painful as well. We are doing dynamic split-include for some other domains but without the MPLS need on the backend. \n What I am trying to figure out is if I add this voice domain to that split include will it route it via the MPLS when the routes are present and out through the ASA when the routes are gone (because MPLS is down)?

I assumed that when the firewall is asked to resolve the DNS record it becomes aware of the FQDN and says ok yep that is good, but my DNS server is not forwarding DNS to the firewall, so how does the firewall know that an IP address is part of the *SASvendor.com domain?

This seems to be the case because every time I terminate one, the results on the tester keep changing.\n Is there any way I can terminate these ?!

I've done maybe 1000 terminations in my time. So I don't consider myself an expert when it comes to structured cabling and termination.\n I am preparing to help a church do a network reset and need some advice on some particulars. Up until a couple months ago I would not have told you that I had a preferred brand of Cat5e / Cat6 keystone jack, but on that job I had to terminate a dozen Cat 6 cables to jacks and was provided Panduit brand jacks. I felt like they were easier for me to terminate than anything I had used before.\n With that being said I wonder if you experienced folks have a preferred brand or model of jack? I estimate there will be around 150 keystone terminations to do with the church job, and I will be installing these into modular (blank) patch panels.\n I would like to try out the JackRapid tool, and see that it has versions for many different jacks, anyone have good or terrible experience with the tool itself? \n Does anyone know the practical differences between Leviton 5g108 vs 5g110? \n Is there any reason to consider Cat5e these days or should I just go straight to Cat6? Is there a cable brand that is preferred, with regards to colors being clear and easy to see, cable not too bulky, etc?\n Thanks for any advice!\n    submitted by    /u/PolarSuns  \n [link]   [comments]",

These are important firewalls as far as our traffic flow goes and all have HA redundancy.\n The engineer will backup and compare configs and run tests after each firmware update. That means 6 times we do this to ONE firewall before we reach the version we want. 48 times all together for the whole network.\n On each incremental update we test all functionality, then let it \"run\" like that for a day or two, fill out a checks form then upload our configs then do it again for the next incremental update.\n Am I losing my mind here? Why are we not doing incremental upgrade, run a config comparison then upgrade to the next until we are done and then do our final checks on the final revision. It would take an hour instead of a week. Am I being too relaxed? I've probably upgraded thousands of these things in my life but this is the first time I seen someone do this so manually and labor intensive and slow.

          "description": "In a firewall you have a routing table and a policy. The routing table is used to determine what traffic goes to what next-hop IP-address or interface, and a policy is used to specify what traffic is allowed through the firewall. \n Now a colleague of mine has come up with the idea to start using policy-based routes instead or normal routes as an extra layer of security. The idea is to use policy-based routes to specify which sources (subnets or interfaces) are routed to specific networks. His argumentation is that if you make a mistake in the firewall policy and accidentally allow too much traffic, the PBR rules will prevent the traffic to being routed to the addresses it shouldn't be allowed to reach. \n This to me sounds like a really bad idea, and makes an already complex network more overly complex. I have never seen PBR being (mis)used for something like this.

This could get a little finicky. \n I'm thinking of testing out a pull-based automation platform, but I don't have any experience with them whatsoever. My Ansible experience is limited to laboratory environments. I've used Nornir to backup devices, but again, hit or miss depending on what's online. I schedule this to occur once nightly at a time where I should have a decent success ratio. What would be easier? Having the configurations managed from a central automation platform and having the devices pull that down. \n I don't yet have a Single Source of Truth developed, but I am working on this.

Each ISR has it's own transit network with it's own /29, and therefore the ASA sees each ISR's downlink as a separate WAN\n All of this today, works very well, I could say that I'm very satisfied.\n However, with the new year coming, I need to make changes to match the new WAN links that are inbound.\n So, my question:\n Is it possible for me to purchase say a modern ASR, link 4, 5, say 6 WAN links to it directly (route to internet direct), and then with that single ASR, join my DMVPN cloud?\n Consider that the single ASR, will have a single serial number, hence a single certificate, and I'm trying to join DMVPN with a single ASR as \"multiple spokes\"\n The reason for this is that each WAN link needs to be encrypted by way of dmvpn, such that the transit downlink to the ASA is encrypted. The ASA knows only that he sees 4-5 WAN links, which are ultimately DMVPN spokes\n Thank you for any feedback\n    submitted by    /u/evs9000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all\n We've run into a major production issue with our pair of Dell 4032 switches - they are used as iSCSI for 3 esxi hosts and distribution for other devices. Issue is: out of the blue we lost access to several VMs. \n Rebooting one of the two restored access, however, the issue keeps coming back and the only fix is a reload. We replaced one of the switches but the problem remains - after 1 day (at most) we lose access to critical VMs and until we reboot the device. There's nothing relevant in the logs (I'll attach the spanning-tree detail and running config). There were no changes made to the environment or configs. besides setting the root bridge ID to a lower value on one of the two (from the default 32768).\n Important to mention: when we lose the VMs - switch management and access is…",

That way things like SSDP stay within their boundaries (239.255.255.250:1900)? Although thinking further, the other chatty protocol - mDNS/bonjour uses 224.0.0.251 which is link-local multicast and from my experience doesn't get \"snooped\". \n From some PCAPs I did see that Meraki has the layer 2 switch Querier feature enabled by default.\n Just curious if this is something others think about enabling.\n    submitted by    /u/davis-sean  \n [link]   [comments]",

Would be good to move that to the device but not a biggie.\n Our internet speed is 500/500.\n Security is a big thing, I regularly see palo being recommended here, forti too.\n I personally see watchguard, palo and Cisco in the field.\n A apart of me doesn’t want to spend a bunch of money but I know if it’s spent in the right area, I won’t have to think about it again. \n Saw a silver peak device not long ago but it looks like they only do SD-WAN and not actual firewalling?

          "description": "from the dhcp rfc:\n  \nNote that, in some network architectures (e.g., internets with more than one IP subnet assigned to a physical network segment), it may be the case that the DHCP client should be assigned an address from a different subnet than the address recorded in 'giaddr'. Thus, DHCP does not require that the client be assigned as address from the subnet in 'giaddr'. A server is free to choose some other subnet, and it is beyond the scope of the DHCP specification to describe ways in which the assigned IP address might be chosen.\n  \nImagine a relay receives a DHCPDISCOVER on interface eth0 with address 192.168.1.1, then it forwards it to the dhcp server at 192.168.0.1, now because it's not required to give an address on the 192.168.1.0 subnet, it gives an address on the 192.168.0.0 subnet, how is this acceptable?\n ​\n Then another host on the 0.0 subnet would arp for the client, but the client wouldnt receive the arp broadcast since they are not on the same physical subnet.\n    submitted by    /u/UniqueBasis882  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have the vendor reviewing this but they are taking their time.\n We have a box in the DMZ that has a nic in our LAN and a nic in the DMZ.\n When it's up, it causes two external facing resources to go down which also have IPs in the DMZ.\n Running a packet capture from the troublesome box reveals that the impacted resources are retransmitting many packets and I'm seeing many SACK_PERM's, but it also appears to be as though this trouble box is jumping into other conversations. Example:\n 381 7.286147 [impacted resource DMZ IP] [external IP of something outside our network] TCP 68 [TCP Port numbers reused] 443 → 53905 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=8190 Len=0 MSS=1460 WS=256 SACK_PERM 382 7.286170 [troublesome box IP] [impacted resource DMZ IP] ICMP 96 Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)\n Where packet 382 contains the source and destination IPs from packet 381. It's like the troublesome box sees packet 381, encapsulates it, and sends it back to the impacted resource, but gets a destination unreachable. It's not doing this to all other IPs in the DMZ either, just two of them.\n Another example of the trouble box showing up after a regular ICMP\n 349 6.621700 [impacted resource DMZ IP] [some external IP] ICMP 62 Echo (ping) reply id=0x0004, seq=8403/54048, ttl=255 350 6.621737 [troublesom box IP] [impacted resource DMZ IP] ICMP 80 Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)\n And packet 350 contains this under the ICMP portion of its packet: Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: [impacted resource DMZ IP], Dst: [some external IP]\n Anyone have any idea what this thing is doing?\n    submitted by    /u/hueylewisNthenews  \n [link]   [comments]",
