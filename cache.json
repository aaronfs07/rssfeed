The ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts configuration files on ESXi servers, potentially rendering virtual machines (VMs) unusable. \nCISA has released an ESXiArgs recovery script at github.com/cisagov/ESXiArgs-Recover. Organizations that have fallen victim to ESXiArgs ransomware can use this script to attempt …",

In October 2022, CISA identified a widespread cyber campaign involving the malicious use of legitimate RMM software. Specifically, cyber criminal actors sent phishing emails that led to the download of legitimate RMM software—ScreenConnect (now ConnectWise Control) and AnyDesk—which the actors used in a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts.\nAlthough this …",

          "description": "I used to do IT work at an MSP for hillbillies in the panhandle of Florida for a couple of years and it was very back breaking work but I ended up learning a lot of aspects such that I would consider myself a Tier 2 in terms of skill. I recently moved to Miami and got picked up by a very top shelf corporate company. It's one of the most sought out due to their benefits and I've heard other techs had to apply 17 times to get their jobs so I assumed I would be surrounded by the top of the top. Instead, it's been 4 months and I can confirm I'm surrounded by some of the laziest inept workers I have ever seen. No one wants to work, tickets are constantly needing to be reopened, users always complaining. Some techs even get written up several times a month but have still been with the company for 4 years because \"they never fire\".\n This is my first venture into Corporate IT for a large company of around 20,000 employees but I already feel like 80% of the IT department are milking checks. Is this the same across the majority of big companies like this? Should I bother staying with them if i spend more time patching up others mistakes rather than learning something new? I will admit that there are definetly career oppurtunies as most people working in IT support here are so bad my manager has considered making me a IT Tech Tier III Lead but my past jobs would have pinned me as Tier 1.5-2 in skill (fake it till you make it lol)\n    submitted by    /u/SignificantAd5680  \n [link]   [comments]",

They started having downtime on Friday, December 2nd at 2 AM and by 6 AM on Saturday had revealed that they experienced a security incident.

So what I have is the following at this point: \n  \nAn 86 GB PST file with email from 2018 to December 2nd, 2022.\n Emails form December 3rd through today that I use WHM/Cpanel to host. It's Maildir format if that helps. I use Thunderbird to check it.\n  \nWhat I'd like to wind up with is getting onto Office 365 and import the PST file. That should be straightforward. However, how can I take the email from December 3rd until now and get that into Office 365? Perhaps I could setup a separate Outlook account with IMAP that pulls from my CPanel mail account and then just drag the emails from IMAP into my new Office 365 account?\n Or does anyone else have a suggestion on how I could accomplish this?\n Thanks,\n John\n    submitted by    /u/geo1999  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have three main offices and a few satellite offices all connected through Meraki VPN tunnels. We have just over 400 employees/contractors.\n On-Site I have two Dell SAN’s, one for production and one for on-site backup. Seven ESXi hosts and ~33 Cisco switches. Cisco CUCM VoIP system and ~90 VM’s. A Synology for off-site backup.\n In the two other offices I have Dell R series servers, one for back up and one for production.\n Now down to the “meat and potatoes”. I do it all from on-boarding to off-boarding to keeping all the hosts, VM’s, switches and other hardware updated. I babysit employees/contractors everyday with the stupid things you read on here every day. I work 60-80 hours a week. In 2022 I worked every holiday there was. I used 7 hours of PTO time the whole year. I’m 59 years old and I’m tired. The kind of tired you can’t sleep off. (what is sleep?)\n Management refuses to let me hire someone experienced to help. (they let me hire a 17 y/o intern about a year ago) but he didn’t last.\n I make a little over $100K with a $13K bonus in 2022. There’s a ton more but that’s the gist of it.\n Opinions? Comments?

(pgpwde --add-bypass --disk 0 --count 6 --aa)\n Copies SED reflect drivers to needed folder for use during upgrade\n Create variable OSDSetupAdditionalUpgradeOptions to include the above reflect drivers\n Upgrade to newer version of Windows 10\n Restart computer\n Re-register the SED password filter\n Disable SED bypass (pgpwde --remove-bypass --aa)\n Reboot\n Decrypt SED encrypted drive (pgpwde --decrypt --disk 0 --aa --all)\n Uninstall SED\n The sequence goes on, but the above is the pertinent bits.\n  \nThe issue I'm having is that the \"pgpwde --remove-bypass -aa\" command is failing after the upgrade.\n The error I'm getting is -11977 Improper Initialization, which I can only find one reference when Googling, which is: https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=f100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427&CommunityKey=8deae12f-88a6-4d88-9186-231c4ca171d7&tab=digestviewer#bmf100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427\n Which references Linux.\n The removal of the bypass only fails before a user logs in. Once a user has logged onto the machine, and back off again, then the bypass can be removed.\n So, my thought process is that, perhaps, SED isn't sully started when Windows starts, resulting in a weird state where the commands won't run until SED finishes starting, but I'm not sure SED's underlying mechanics enough to remediate this.\n It's also an older version of SED, like 10.4 or something.\n    submitted by    /u/Nakatomi2010  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hiring managers are biased to choose people closer to their own age, whether it be older OR younger. Are these unique experiences I've had, or is it true for everyone?\n I am definitely on the younger side of this sysadmin thing, in my mid 20s. I do not have as much experience as some of you folks but am definitely qualified for the roles I've been interviewed for and while I'm not the best interviewee in the world, I feel I'm decent enough.\n I'm just starting my third tech/sysadmin role. I've probably had 6 or 7 interviews that have gotten to or near the final stage in this field between all of these roles. For every role I have ended up getting, my direct manager has been quite young for someone in their position, somewhere in their 20s for all of them. These aren't even interviews that I feel I've done particularly well in. In fact, I feel some of them were quite bad, worse than ones I have failed.\n However, I notice the opposite with deciders who are a generation or two older than me. Many of them more than double my age. In these interviews, I have come out feeling like I nailed every question and left no room for questioning, but still find out they have chosen the other candidate or did not choose me for hire. From my personal experiences it just seems so blatant and honestly the largest factor in the interview process. Has anyone else experienced this as an interviewee or interviewer, or have I just had some unlucky experiences?\n    submitted by    /u/ILiveForDying  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to accomplish this for her, but I'm up against a few factors that are making it a little irritating to deal with.\n So for example, cached exchange mode. Even after telling it to download the offline address book again, the name doesn't properly update. And Exchange and Teams admin centers, new name shows up when referencing the online GAL, but client-side the old name and new name often show up at the same time depending on which viewport you're opening.\n Am I gonna have to nuke offline OABs and force cache resets?\n And this does seem like a lot of unnecessary effort, but it is a very important and personal issue to her and I'd like to accommodate her wishes.\n    submitted by    /u/dekyos  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even though im still always doing things.\n I was curious as to if anyone else here has ever done such a good job at a company, that the company felt they were no longer needed because everything always works and there are very few pr minor issues happening?\n I also ask because when i first started my job here, there were fires to put out every day. The question every day was \"what are we fixing today\". And according to staff, this was the norm for many years. They havent had their systems consistantly work for years. \n Over the course of the past 2 years ive been here, i have fixed many problems and was able to make it so people are no longer asking \"what is going to break today\", and they can confidently do their job. However, i have found that i am not doing as much work as i used to now. Half of the day is making sure everything is still working fine, or coming up with new ideas/projects to work on for improvements, and the other half of the day is just studying and researching because there really isnt too much else that i can do. And this is unfortunate because all of that work and research nobody can trace or see that i am doing it, they can only assume. Or for the worse, assume im not doing it.\n I realized that, to the everyday staff worker, i went from always walking around helping people and always being seen, to basically being a hermit who never has to leave his office. I dont think that they will let me go because they do love what i have done, but the anxiety side of me worries that if they dont see me actively doing something, they will think im not doing anything, and given nothing is breaking to fix, im no longer needed.\n    submitted by    /u/CleverKrunk  \n [link]   [comments]",

We tried re-running the logon script but that said the drives were already mapped. We went to try mapping the drives using the Map Network Drive wizard in File Explorer, and we found that the wizard could actually see the network drives. This led us to discover that restarting File Explorer made the drives visible.\n We tried setting the EnableLinkedConnections registry entry (e.g. as per this ServerFault post) but this did not help.\n We tried enabling NETLOGON debug logging on computers where the incidents were reported, but the NETLOGON debug log didn't show any obvious causes.\n Can anyone suggest what might be causing this issue and how we can resolve it?

Our Head of HR knows all about policies etc. Our C level exec of law is VERY knowledge in law.\n Its not just past jobs either, you wouldnt hire a head of medical surgery that had no idea how to perform any surgery. You wouldnt hire head chef who couldnt cook. Imagine hiring a head of Marketing or Sales who had little to no idea about marketing or sales.\n I'm not saying you need to be hyper technical about IT to be a CIO, but you at least have to be good at it in some capacity in ADDITION to have good soft, management and leadership skills (just like any other C level position). I'm not advocating hiring a technical person who has crap soft skills btw. \n Is it just that finding someone who is technical and has the above skills is to hard to find in IT? So they just hire non technical people to run IT departments because thats all their is in the talent pool?\n    submitted by    /u/ThatAJC88  \n [link]   [comments]",

They still want me to find a way. \n If I do move forward with it - is there a overall setting that will allow personal emails to come through? Or do I need to mark each sender as safe, as they come in. Maybe the second approach is safest.

          "description": "Hello altogether,\n I'd like to tell you something about task on going and I am stuck therefore I am searching for new creative ideas in this topic.\n --\n Background story: We currently use Office 2016 for Blue collar workers where they use shared-devices in order to edit documents, review or save them. Basically what a white collar does just with a M365 E3 License. However Microsoft has announced that Office 2016 and below is ending support for M365 Connectivity services - that's where the problem begins.\n Cause: Microsoft announced that Office 2016 will be dismissed with supporting connections to M365-Services like SharePoint and OneDrive. (See: Office versions and connectivity to Microsoft 365 services - Deploy Office | Microsoft Learn )\n Issue: Solution would be easy to convert everybody to M365 licenses but with almost 7500 BCs it will be way too expensive and cannot justified against management to have such an rise of expenses for licensing.\n Idea: Then I though, hey let's enable Viewer Mode for M365 products such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They can view but cannot edit them. If they need to edit documents they can use Word Online and we are going to assign them M365 F3. \n But there is the next issue which comes with it:\n They cannot access any network shared files where all the local files are located today. Then they need to manually open OneDrive for Business and Word Online everytime and upload the files which they wanna use, save, download and upload it to the network sahre. This won't work since conflict risk is pretty high at that amount of users.\n This is not a great solution and I am out of ideas since Microsoft does not provide any further information. Before I create a ticket at Microsoft I'd like to ask the community whether you have any ideas and if you may experience the same issue in your company?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Techret  \n [link]   [comments]",

Where I bought dresses I wear in Facebook photos, where I've booked a dinner reservation etc. In addition to this, I keep being subscribed to newsletters I don't remember signing up to.

I dont understand IMAP or POP but my understanding is, IMAP allows my gmail to be synced with a different mailbox and all changes (including deletions) are synced. \n I'm of the belief this is how my stalker is doing it, but as this is an ongoing investigation with the police (there is a court order in place).

Everyone suddenly starts to make calls. Let's say - understandable.

If you have some mobile internet then why not write to our HelpDesk? Or at least e-mail or the messenger we use in work? Why would you write to a messenger I never use for work and is only personal? I mean I will probably just block that person over there. Or at least ignore.\n I'm sorry for this rant but I really don't get some people.

          "description": "I know we all hate those little yellow Post-It notes with passwords, but…\n So this week my childhood best friend’s brother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. He was barely fifty. The family had no idea where to start. They didn’t know if he had a will and, if so, who might be the executor. They didn’t know his financial relationships. They didn’t know his insurance policies. They didn’t know who his lawyer was. He was somewhat secretive, and they were stumped.\n What they did have was a stack of four laptops, ranging from his current laptop to plan older one circa 2004. They brought them to me to see if I could “hack” into them and glean anything that might point them in the right direction. I promised I would do what I could.\n I started with the only one that had a power adapter. I was lucky enough that the default account, “user”, had no password and had admin rights. I logged in, reset the password for his account, and started hunting. I found a few work-related documents and some photos of his kids and not much else.\n Next, I gathered all the old laptop chargers I had around and tried to fit the laptops. No luck. Where is my universal charger? ugh. Anyway, I opened one of the laptops and what comes fluttering out? A single Post-It Note. I though, “Please let this be a password”. We all know that is the main use of these damn yellow sticky papers, right? Well it wasn’t, but it was just as good. It was a list of names and phone numbers. Lawyer. Banker. Investment advisor. Insurance agent. Mortgage broker. The works.\n Anyway, thank God for little yellow notes, but I still need to get into the laptops. Anyone have any recommendations for boot sticks that might permit resetting SAM accounts, mounting file systems, etc? I used to use Trinity Rescue Kit, but that was half a career ago. I am also hoping nothing is encrypted; wish me luck.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/DrunkenGolfer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Installed aNag app on my Android device and had a widget on my phone home screen. Net result was that if I (as an example) dropped a disk from my md-raid, my phone would get an active alert within 5 minutes.\n Now in 2023 I am looking to start fresh and ask for suggestions on a completely new monitoring system that meets that requirement. What will alert me within 5-10 minutes of a failed disk, to my Android phone? Active monitoring only, not something that pushes an email or something, since if that system failed, it could fail quiet. \n All clients to be monitored are Linux and I'm only interested in free and open source tools.

I'm not a sysadmin myself, in fact I'm pretty new to the IT world.\n I was tasked with connecting my org's SSO solution to our Google domain so we could use 2FA. I thought I had set it up wrong because when I logged out and back in, there was no redirect to the SSO page; it just took my Google password as always. I did some digging and apparently the reason is that I'm a Super Admin for our domain and Google doesn't allow Super Admin accounts to use SSO (unless you're signing in from within a network mask...which I don't understand). I then tested it with multiple end user accounts, and the SSO redirect worked correctly.\n I'm confused. Wouldn't the Super Admin accounts have the biggest need for protection? These are the accounts with the highest privileges. I must be missing something here, right?\n Edit: I understand now. In my head I was thinking SSO implied 2FA, which it doesn't. You wouldn't want an admin account to be using SSO without 2FA but Google can't really enforce that without ruling out SSO altogether. I'll change the post flair.

Generally speaking we purchase all devices through Apple Business account so it will already be in the Apple Business Manager but every now and then there’s a need for us (or a client) to purchase directly and the. Add to ABM manually. \n What’s winding me up is how inconsistent this experience is.\n Normally it’s as simple as switch the device on, get to the WiFi part of setup and then if fire up Apple Configurator on another iPhone that’s signed into ABM, it detects this and the new device is added to the ABM. You then need to immediately change the MDM to InTune on ABM and force an InTune to ABM sync before you allow it factory reset. It’s then hit and miss on whether or not the device will get stuck at the “obtaining configuration from org” screen. So it’s already a bit flaky even for orgs where this is about as simple as it can be (single profile for that enrollment method) but “tends” to work. \n That’s annoying but I can live with it. What’s annoying me more is that on some new devices fresh out of the box (and old that are factory reset) they refuse to pair up at the WiFi screen, nothing happens at all.

We are working towards getting our devices into Intune but aren’t there yet. \n Remote devices have BitLocker with a Pin setup, and we had a theft of a laptop recently and luckily the device was BitLockered with decent pin, we reset user password and revoked 365 sessions for good measure – end of IT’s involvement. Everyone in our org has MFA enforced, we have configured recommended Conditional Access policies and we generally follow best practice where we can.\n But it got me thinking, if that laptop had not had a BitLocker Pin (TPM ONLY) or the Pin was weak (or user had written it down on a post-it note in the laptop bag…….) what would the thief been able to access? They wouldn’t have been able to caddy the drive due to TPM but could they have booted off a USB utility tool (Hiren or whatever it is now) and reset the Administrator password and then logged in as local admin and had access to the local user profiles and data?\n If so, is there anyway to mitigate this? I also note that deploying devices via Intune/AutoPilot, there is no out of the box/automated way of setting a unique TPM pin which wages a debate about if pin is even necessary.\n    submitted by    /u/mythumbsclick  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've in a couple of cases brought up clearly detailed requests for career advancements, daily tasks upgrades etc to my boss but they would get shot down, only for him to come back to me 6 or 8 months later with pretty much 90% of what i had proposed before -as if i had handed him a template. Sometimes its him who would have said to me tell me what you think you need to do or focus on next then i sit down for like a week detailing something only for it to get shot down -it kinda feels like its some secret spying or HR thing that they are doing on me.

We have a separate stand-alone hyper-v host that hosts our Veeam servers - a broker server and a proxy. This server has a dual port 10GB card in it. I ordered and received a server to replace this stand-alone hyper-v host. I worked with our vendor to order the new server spec'd like our current server. I don't know where the breakdown happened (I know I screwed up), but the new server did not come with the 2 10GB (SPF+) ports. To make matters worse, there are no available slots in install a card. Before I tell my boss we spent $25K on a server that we can't use, I'd like some feedback. This server's sole use is hosting these 2 Veeam servers. The network ports I have are 1GB. How screwed am I?

I am supposed to be able to us UKG Dimensions and see my Kronos punches and schedule. Well I put in the url that my company says to put in the UKG site and app. I can see my Kronos punches fine. But it randomly shows the schedule. Never the current schedule or upcoming, but it will show what it was two weeks ago sometimes. \n What I am wondering is... Is there a box/setting the manager has to have selected while making the UKG schedule to have it show up on the UKG Dimensions website/app?

User was not receiving an email from certain email address(it is a distribution list address) in their outlook. So I wanted to forward the email coming to that email address to user's email address. \n To do this we have to change the mailbox in OWA to the distribution list address and set forwarding settings to user's email. But some reason my brain lagged and I forwarded user's email to that address. The user called me next day saying that there are no emails /receiving email in their outlook client/OWA. I immediately knew what I did and disabled the forwarding setting and they were able to receive emails again. But emails during forwarding setting was enabled was not in their mailbox. I checked with our l2 team and they said it impossible to do anything in this case. I also did not check keep a copy during forwarding. \n So not only I did not do my job, I created a task for user where they have to request the sender to send the emails again which is a very troublesome task depending on how many emails they received during that time. I requested user to check if the emails could be sent again yesterday. Or they have to contact the distribution list owner and send their emails back. Now I am waiting for user response and depending on their response I might lose my job. I had a panic attack and still thinking about it. How I could do such a simple mistake.

This seems to correct whatever component store/SXS corruption initially, but the problem is it seems like for many systems, the problem resurfaces in a month or two. We've since had two Premier tickets with Microsoft without any identification of a root cause. We have looked for various underlying trends such as build process, PC model, installed features/software, antivirus, etc but have been unable to pin it down. We're still using WSU, but we don't believe the issue is on the update server side. It just seems that at some point these machines get corrupted and no amount of SFC or DISM will fix them.

My experience at past roles has been varied, usually am told to read documentation, check the backlog & review the ticketing system to get familiar with common issues. I feel like there’s a better way to set myself up for success.\n I have the natural instinct to want to “fix everything“ and jump right in to the backlog to look productive. Is this a good idea or should I spend a few days/weeks understanding the environment? I want to be helpful but I don’t want to come off as a know-it-all who says everything needs to be changed. Also, I’m aware that some organizations want the end solutions but don’t want the pain of change, so it‘s never a simple process. I feel that starting with documentation may be a better start and mapping out how the IT infrastructure is designed, but not sure what’s next before getting in the weeds.\n I want to make a good impression and ramp up quickly.

          "description": "I will try to make this explanation short. My company uses an old Enterprise Resource Program (ERP) that uses Java as part of its components. It is truly solely IE dependent for other reasons as well. I have established that over the last 4 years since I began here. I, of course sounded the alarm years ago to management repeatably that IE had an expiration date. They began the lengthy project of upgrading to a cloud version roughly a year ago. This project also is folding in two other ERP programs into this upgrade so you can imagine the huge amount of work going into this. We are projected to go live with this in May.\n I missed the announcement from Microsoft that they would be putting an arrow through the heart of Internet Explorer on Valentines day and I am just discovering users that have had it updated. Basically if you try to use IE it automatically redirects to Edge. The previous settings in Edge under settings>default browser\" allowed you to disable the redirect. That is all gone now. I have tried uninstalling all the MS updates on their computers from Feb 14 to date. But none of them seem to give back the capability to use IE. It seems to be the version of Edge 110.0.1587.46 had the options available so that you could stop it from redirecting. Now under version 110.0.1587.89 they are gone. I am trying to find a way to roll this back and possibly stop a major work stoppage for my company. Any suggestions would be appreciated. \n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Maleficent_Mango9348  \n [link]   [comments]",

To my horror I could see everyone else's device, even an old server I think they may not have been using anymore that appear to monitor temperatures. I reported this while there and they promptly locked everything down (essentially just turning on WIFI isolation).\n This time I'm on a cruise ship and not brought my Alfa card with me. Not done an nmap scan as I know about the legality of that. But thought running WIFI shark while I'm connected to check my on ship account shouldn't hurt. But noticed loads of MDNS entries at all the other guests devices. All their device names.

If we don’t we have issues with the CPU maxing out at 100% on weird built in system processes. Anyone else see that and/or have a solution for It. It’s also weird that we don’t have to do it on the desktops we get from them.\n For reference we’re a relatively small shop and don’t have put out a ton of laptops all the time. I’d say 2-3 a month. If we didn’t have to do a full reimage, we typically install office 365, sophos AV, ninja RMM client, forticlient VPN, run a round or two of windows updates then add the computer to the domain. I also run Dell command update and remove optimizer.\n Just looking for any suggestions other than reimage them every time. I’ve built MDT servers in the past so I know that’s an option, but don’t think i do enough computers to justify the time investment yet.\n    submitted by    /u/sarnold2245  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All, \n I have always been confused with the retention policies in M365. So hopefully someone here can clarify this for me. \n If you enable retention policy to retain all data indefinitely in M365 via Microsoft 365 Data Lifecycle Management so it applies globally to all M365 apps (exchange, onedrive, sharepoint etc.). What happens if you disable a user account and remove the license?\n - Will the retention policies be applied to users One Drive?\n - Will the retention policies be applied to users emails? I know its not going to create inactive mailbox but can you still search the emails from/to this users via eDiscovery?\n - What happens after 30 days, 60 days or 90 days when the standard Microsoft retention period (outside M365 Data Lifecycle Management) expires? Will the data get deleted or will the retention policy kick in and all data will still be available via eDiscovery?\n The key here is, I dont care about restoring user data, it is more for compliance/legal purposes so as long as their data is searchable and can be found within e-discovery, I am happy.\n I keep getting conflicting messages from few M365 consultants. Some saying you need to delete the account when the license is still intact otherwise retention policy wont kick in. Others are saying it should apply the retention policy setup globally regardless. I dont want to find it the hard way so im just gathering some information here and there while waiting an official answer from M$.\n    submitted by    /u/Willing_Radio932  \n [link]   [comments]",

Other machines appear to be unaffected. The two in question boot after Secure Boot is disabled. Both happen to be older desktop-class computers used for software testing purposes, but I wouldn't put money on this problem only affecting non-server class hardware. (HP EliteDesk 800 G2 Mini, Lenovo M93p Tiny; confirmed that both have the latest firmware available.)\n As others have noted, the problem only shows itself on the second reboot after KB5022842 is installed.\n Be careful! I'd be willing to bet that this problem affects a lot more machines than is currently being reported.

Everything was pretty normal until I noticed everyone was watching me as I entered \"Bobs office\" just to see my reaction. \n Bob was a special kind of hoarder. Bob liked his paper. Blueprints, White plotter blueprints, Legal sized paper, A4 for some reason, and normal Printer paper. You would think this is normal... and you would be wrong. Bob had this paper from print jobs EVERYWHERE. My words cannot easily describe what I mean by EVERYWHERE. The entire floor.... white paper. Every surface in the office, paper with an avalanche of paper drifting down to the floor... His chair HAD PAPER IN IT with some weird blueprint rolls off the back of the chair making a backrest. I have no idea if his desk was wood or metal because all I saw was paper avalanching off of the 2 sides of the desk not against the wall all the way down to the floor. His monitors were sat on mounds of paper and I had to remove the paper FROM ONTOP OF HIS KEYBOARD!!! Mentally picture fresh powder on a mountain ready for skiing, but replace the snow with paper, this was his entire office, floor to nearly celling. The door would not close because of the 3+ inches of paper on the floor. A normal box of printer paper is 5,000 sheets. His office easily had 500,000 sheets of paper in it, and that may be a conservative estimate because I am over here doing math on how much volume that many sheets of paper would be, and its still not enough. \n When I left the office I played it cool and asked when their last inspection from the Fire Marshall was, the Office Managers face got red and she mumbled something about having \"Bob pick up after himself\".\n    submitted by    /u/stratospaly  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are just looking to splash some cash since we have some left over come tax time.\n My main concern is, during meetings no one wants to use their work laptop to share their screen in big presentations. They just put their powerpoint on a network share and run it off the NUC, but they still like to use their personal machines to share their just for quick bits and peices like <4 quick catchups.

I was looking at BlueTally but i don't know if it can have multiple currencies or something like that.\n ​\n Any info would be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/flash_killer2007  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think it might be the imaging drum but it still shows as 60% and I dont want to spend a ton of money without making sure what the issue is. Checked the warranty on HP's site, still good. To get the support phone number, the page says I have to signup (red flag #1), so I ignored that, and found the number somewhere else.\n Called the local line, got the song and typical excuse that \"We are experiencing long queue yada yada\". After picking the printers department and waiting for a while the phone system said \"We have a faster moving line, if you speak english, press x\". Since English is not a problem, I went there.\n A lady picks up, listens to my problem and says she can't help because they don't deal with printers (red flag #2). Wants to give me a long phone number (unrecognizable to me) and refuses to say which country it belongs to, so how can I use it? (red flag #3)\n Realizing she has no idea where I'm calling from, I explain how I reached there, including the fact that I speak 2 languages, to which she says \"Wow, you're so talented!\". This is the part that I'm still laughing about.\n The whole conversation was weird, little bit condescending and silly. To me this is all kind of hilarious because I didn't expect anything better than this when calling HP 😂\n    submitted by    /u/ivanraddison  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example,\n - if i download \"ConEmu\" from the official website, the binary has a valid certificate chain where the root CA is in the trusted roots of the computer. This prompts the Smartscreen. If i \"unblock\" the file from properties i can run it.\n - i download \"notepad++\" from the official website as well, valid certificate chain with trusted root. This doesn't prompt smartscreen, directly UAC...\n Can someone explain this behavior ? I could see that the trigger of smartscreen is the \"zone identifier\" of the executable, but as told in the example, both of these were downloaded from the internet... \n Also, how can i check the zone identifier of an executable?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ph8l33p  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lately, I have been contemplating a career move to become a software developer. I am looking for advice on whether this move is worth it and what skills or experience I should have to make it happen.\n I have enjoyed my time as a sysadmin, but I am looking for a career that is more fulfilling and flexible. My main goal is to start a business one day as soon as possible, and I am wondering which career path will be more advantageous in this regard. I am starting to enjoy building things, and I am concerned that being a sysadmin will mostly be a tech support role until I get into management. I also can't see how any sysadmin skills will help in business/side hustles until it gets bit enough to need storage and automation. Whereas i feel like building small apps and implementations is possible to do on the side at least if i was to understand development\n I was considering doing a 6 – 10 month bootcamp to help transition, but am also considering other options. What are the key differences between being a sysadmin and a software developer? And most importantly, which career path will be more beneficial for starting a business or work for myself in the future, sysadmin/devops route or software development?\n Lastly, holding me back from making this move is that I have recently landed a role as a lone systems admin and have okay money now (90k AUD) and am enjoying 20% of the work (building/scripting things) and the title. Does it get much better? I am worried about losing the stability and the title of my current role, but I also know that sys admin skills aren’t really transferable to many starting out businesses and side hustles.\n I appreciate any advice or insight.

One sees R2D2 in the screen for approximately 80 seconds before we see him again in frame, disconnected from the terminal. I contend R2D2’s dongle is capable of yottabit speed.\n The hard drive used to store the plans allegedly held 512 million exanodes of space, as depicted in Star Wars Rogue One. This would therefore be 512 yotta nodes if one follows the metric naming convention for numerical prefixes.\n General (poor) assumptions: (1) R2D2 spent all 80 seconds downloading the plans to the Death Star (2) the plans to the Death Star and its build history downloaded filled up the drive (3) a bit is equivalent to a node (4) no q-bit fuckery is afoot and (5) the plans are uncompressed.\n 512/80 is 6.4 yottabit/second throughput.\n    submitted by    /u/Skyyacht  \n [link]   [comments]",

During the course of that initial replication copy, there was a root folder on the same drive where the shared folder was being replicated to and that root folder is now gone. Backups were not in production at the time as the server was still being configured. Replication only went one direction (Old Server to New Server) for one folder and its sub folders (IE D:\\SharedFolder\\FolderShares1-6 and User Redirected Folders). this was done as a form of migration of the file servers. \n Now that the folder is gone, I am wondering why would DFS remove that folder if it was not part of the replication. I am also now running into issues where users are denied access to their User Redirected Folders, which still reside on the old File server and are managed via GPO.\n    submitted by    /u/ITGuyDave  \n [link]   [comments]",

In fairness they’re the second MSP and took over last year from another MSP.\n There’s been a few red flags (100s of dormant AD accounts, Azure servers running but not used for anything, etc) all minor things I could chalk up to unintentional or old MSP shenanigans. One frustration mentioned when I started is the migration from the previous MSP is only now being wrapped up by the new MSP, a year later. All these things I again can chalk up to scheduling, waiting for resources, etc. \n What I do need a sanity check on is the slowness of response for requests of 1) documentation and network diagrams, 2) quotes for new projects, and 3) a lack of interest in consolidating/disabling portions of Azure infrastructure.\n For example, I requested a rough estimate for five projects 8 business days ago. By no means detailed SoWs, just a rough number for budget setting. Or waited nearly three weeks for documentation and still no response beyond confirmation of receipt.\n Is this type of non-responsiveness expected?

They were hand-made about 15 years ago, and the original authors are gone. Our sysadmins can maintain with minor edits as needed, but aren't really tasked for making new, complex workflows should the need arise.\n In googling, I found that Microsoft released \"Office Scripts\" in 2020. By \"Office Scripts\", Microsoft really meant, \"Excel Online Scripts\". Have not seen any indication of scripting being extended into Word.\n Is there any successor, alternative, or replacement to Word VBA Macros?

          "description": "Hi r/sysadmin\n I'm curious how you all go about testing your backups? We have a medium/large sized environment with ~1000 VMs and a few physical servers (most SQL boxes) that we are backing up regularly. 98% Windows, a very select few Linux. However, we don't have a definitive process for testing these backups beyond requested restores that we have to do as people need them.\n Previously, I used Veeam's SureBackup feature to test backups at my previous job, but here we use Commvault and I don't see a similar feature. There does seem to be some sort of backup validation but Commvault's documentation doesn't match what I'm seeing in our console.\n Using Veeam's SureBackup as a model, I started to build out a sandbox network that would mirror our production network, which I could restore VMs into and then run scripts against them to verify they are working. The point I'm more or less stuck at is the \"scripts to verify they are working\" part. For basic Windows boxes I've got a script that checks for running services, and for all the VMs I'm pulling their reported heartbeat status by VMWare, but this is imperfect and doesn't cover some of our more specialized boxes like Exchange or SQL databases. \n Somewhere along the line I think there will be a human element (IE, you are the admin for this server, your server is currently in the sandbox network, login to it and make sure everything works before it gets torn down) but I'd like to automate as much of this process as possible.\n What approach do you take? Is there a feature in Commvault I've missed or a third party tool that solves the problem? Or do you have better ideas on what to check using various scripts and the like?\n    submitted by    /u/Pugway  \n [link]   [comments]",

Latter one wasn't documented at all by it's creator who hase left us in the meantime.\n So around the middle of 2022 I got 4 IGEL licenses to test and that worked pretty fine so far, we decided for the UDP / USB-Version and had no problems occur and the remote assistence etc. helped a lot. I had to put the topic aside for a while now due to other more urgend topics and since we lack staff right now. \n I read somewhere that IGEL reworked their license modell and it's no longer \"Buy once, get 1 year of support and that's it. More support costs but you can use the thin client without support\".

If I uninstall the APC UPS Driver, then the UPS gets detected by Windows and the battery symbol appears in the taskbar.\n ​\n Doesnt matter what Windows Server it is. The problem happens on any of our Servers. Randomly I would say. Its really frustrating because you cant seem to fix it remotely.I dont wanna go on site to check the UPSes myself. Not with 100 clients.\n ​\n Anyone else having that issue? Or maybe someone has found a fix?\n    submitted by    /u/One-Garage6348  \n [link]   [comments]",

I plan to use git to save my work in a repo within a branch having a name \"common\" for common things and another branch with name of that of the company I am working for, and to which the laptop belongs, where I will save/commit company specific stuff.\n I see that I am spending a lot of my free time in customizing things. Shell variables, aliases, bash functions, writing scripts to help me login to different envs (Azure, AWS, local Servers etc) easily. Aliases to execute frequent long commands. Functions to execute commands with parameters.\n Wanted to understand, that since this is the beginning for me to customize my env for myself, is it Okay to spend a considerable amount of time in the process? I am hoping that my current way of customizing will help me in future companies also, where I can clone this repo, switch to an old companies branch, take what should be taken from common (probably all), and then create a new branch with the new company name and add that company specific stuff there.\n Will doing things this way, which would make things heavily customized in the future, and might need some maintainence overhead too, is a good idea?

We just route all our mail to the on prem instance and connect Outlook to local exchange.\n The Teams license however does get used for scheduling video calls, and also creating the odd group and channels.\n My understanding is that to do a hybrid migration (and enable it), you can't have existing mailboxes in the cloud and those mailboxes need to be deleted.\n I also understand that Teams stores all the chat data in the mailbox as well. \n So do we need to purge all our existing Team Groups in 365, and chat data as well as - then enable hybrid migration - and re-create them to do our migration successfully? \n We also use SharePoint, but I don't believe that will cause any problems to the exchange migration as far as I know.\n Thanks for your help/input.\n    submitted by    /u/cynocation  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hiya, I work for an organisation with around 400 users, when it comes to Adobe most just use Adobe Reader but we currently have around 60 users licensed for Acrobat Pro and about 20 licensed for Creative Cloud. IT management want to recharge the cost of these licenses to departmental/team cost codes, but we're really struggling with how to keep track of which licenses belong to which team. When a new license is purchased it just goes into one big pool in our Adobe Admin Console, we can allocate it to a new user but there's nothing identifiable about the license itself so no real way to track it as an asset or tag it as owned by a particular team. What would be ideal is a system where we can create groups for different teams and then allocate licenses to each group, I'm just wondering if there's any tool or method that makes this easily possible? Currently all I think to do is have a process of meticulous record keeping in an Excel workbook where we track how many licenses are purchased under each cost code and who is using each license, but this obviously isn't ideal. We need to ensure that licenses are kept within the teams that are paying for them rather than moving around the organisation as people join and leave.\n    submitted by    /u/UpYourGravitas  \n [link]   [comments]",

And while it is absolutely crazy sometimes, I also find myself listening to our customers talk about their jobs and they all seem extremely stressed as well. What I personally like about the MSP life is that it offers diversity:\n  \nDiversity of equipment. Every customer brings a different set of “happy little accidents” to the table and I find that challenge interesting even if I’m not personally the one helping to architect new solutions.\n \nDiversity of focus. If you want to be pigeon-holed or expertise in a specific area, you can. But there are also tons of opportunities for crossover experiences in other areas.\n \nDiversity of customer. Yes you get difficult customers. But you also get some pretty great ones to work alongside. I feel like this is a big benefit and helps to balance the crazy sometimes.\n \nDiversity of ideas. In some ways you’re playing with house money. You can help the customer come up with solutions without having to worry about the dollars and cents. After all, that’s on them to figure out at the end of the day. Obviously you have to be reasonable and help work toward something that benefits everyone involved. But again, that’s a challenge that can be fulfilling.\n \n Those are just a few. And sure, you could read those with the same lenses of a non-MSP job. But isn’t that the point?

What I like about Teamviewer and Anydesk is that I download 1 app that I can connect from and to.

But I do way more than just talking on the phone. Here's the deal. Eventually I would like to pivot out of IT. The reason is because I am more passionate about Science, Biology and Health. I would like to get my masters in Public health and my job won't pay for it if it's not job related. Plus I would like to work in those fields listed above. But it's gonna be hard going from tech support to say a business analyst, regulatory affairs, health policy or any type of non IT job. So I changed my resume title to business analyst. EVen though that's not my official job title. My manager has seen my resume and said it looks good. I'm not sure if he paid attention…",

I get a phone call just before, saying that they just realised that someone pressed the break glass button to exit the building. The emergency button had a case around it and looked very different from the exit one which is touch-free.\n A couple of days later, when setting their cards, I could see that someone would answer the intercom and they would go to open the door manually. But this one is on me, I did not leave specific instructions on how to unlock it. \n #3 Once got called in to help someone find the attach button from outlook. I've also had numerous cases of \"it's not working\", \"is it plugged?\", \"nevermind, thank you\".\n    submitted by    /u/andreimo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Think loads of powerpoint files and video content. Changes and updates are frequently made right up until the presenter walks onstage.\n The assets are generated by the end client’s own internal teams hence the usual solutions of ftp/dropbox/removable media that we would rely on are off the table due to the end client’s security policies.\n My first thought was some hosted storage appliance that we could replicate locally once we get onsite. That way the client’s IT can administer the appliance as they see fit and the local clone/cache will ensure speedy transfers once we get to the pointy end onsite at the event and need to ingest to the show machines.

They all send and receive mail using those, SMTP is on that one address. Am I still correct in assuming that setting policy to \"reject\" should be fine then?\n No other servers should try and send mail using any of our system's domain names. If they do, mail should be rejected. None of my users try to use gmail or others to use our email-addresses as aliases, so that problem is non existent.

The issue with this situation is that everybody that knows the folder name and filename can directly access it as an anonymous user, which is a security risk (for instance, if our domain is example.com, you can navigate to example.com/data/sample.pdf and download the file without logging in).\n Is there a solution on how to set it up in the web.config or some setting in IIS that you can prevent that behavior? I'd like that only users logged into the WP portal can download the files.\n I thought about moving the data/ folder from the app root folder into a folder that is not directly exposed by IIS, but I believe that WordPress would have huge problems accessing that files.\n Edit: I believe IIS (and not WP) is allowing anonymous users to download the files in the data/ folder as it is exposed to the internet. The general idea I'm currently looking at is how to tell IIS which user is authenticated by WP and which is not? Maybe by looking at a Cookie or something?\n    submitted by    /u/lostje89  \n [link]   [comments]",

Depending on what they select as their main issue it may prompt them with a secondary drop down list of more specific issues. For example, Main issue = \"Email\" then a more specific issue list would contain \"Distribution list change\". There is of course a text entry field where they describe their issue further, a severity 1, 2, 3 drop down list, and then then a SUBMIT button.

But what I appreciate the most is how my new manager treats us: I had to do an upgrade for a business critical application (we talk multiple millions in revenue just from this application per week) after hours. It was scheduled to start at 5.45pm, but at 5.30 I got a call \"we need till\" 6pm. Ok, no problem. But you know how it turned out... At 7.30pm I finally could start to shut down the running services. Unfortunately the installation routine runs for up to 60 minutes, even if it fails. So of course this happened multiple times and after some digging around in the log files and doing multiple steps manually that should run automatically, I was finished at around 1.30 in the morning.\n I informed my manager the next day (back at work at 8am) and his response was \"First: Next time just tell them you will not start after the agreed upon time. It's our job to make sure this stuff works, but we are not responsible if they can't finish their work in time. Second: if something like this happens again, feel free to call me for support. I am usually awake till 2am anyways so just give me a call! Third: Go home and sleep - if you work longer hours, just come in later so you can get enough rest\".\n Feeling the support of the people above me and knowing they will stand up for me and help is worth much more than all the things that made me switch jobs in the first place. For the first time in the last two years I enjoy my work again.\n And yes, I did take him by his word the next time something didn't go right: at 10pm I called him.

This is a little surprising, as I understood that greater geographic distance from the server would increase 'ping' times, but actual download speeds should remain mostly unaffected?\n I am generally seeing speed test results that show connection speeds of ~40mb/s through public wifi networks being reduced to somewhere around ~4mb/s-- 10% of the actual underlying connection speed!\n I am looking at setting up another Lightsail instance in Singapore and cloning my OpenVPN files onto it.

That crap hasn't changed in any fundamental way since the 50s, no joke. They kept adding \"modules\" that you had to pay for which supposedly gave the software new functionality. In reality, they were user requested changes to code that didn't work correctly in the first place. Companies were literally paying even more money for upgrades and updates that should have been provided by the vendor. The software was so error prone and full of bugs it made me shiver with rage every time we paid the maintenance agreement.\n The money they burned trying to keep that shit marginally functional was appalling. Support was sold to overseas call centers which made even the most mundane issue a days long slog. They would always promise big new changes were coming and year after year they would dole out a new sliver that made the software slightly more usable than before, for a price. It was just a glorified DB with no real higher functionality. Data mining was an arduous manual process with no tools etc. to facilitate. It relied heavily on external tools for basic use including a gawd awful java interface that barely functioned. \n It was slow, clunky, and contained NO automation of basic daily tasks. I invented multiple ways to mine what we needed and analyze millions of records for pertinent data. The lack of even basic input checks meant people were entering erroneous data on the regular that needed to be pruned, edited, or replaced. It became my full time job just keeping the wheels on.

Cloud and web based would be amazing as long as they can pull up the shipment info by scanning an invoice, plop it on the usb scale, hit a button and then it prints on a networked label printer. We are currently in one building, but we are outgrowing it, so the quick scalability of a browser based cloud app is desirable. I imagine the ui would be more modern than the xp/Vista asthetic of worldship too.\n We've looked into a few, like shiprush for example but, while they would work, they seem geared more towards Ecommerce orders and the onprem sql integrations are an after thought.\n So anyone here have recommendations for a shipping platform geared more towards manufacturing enterprises?\n Thanks friends!\n    submitted by    /u/DarkSideMilk  \n [link]   [comments]",

Of course, I write down commands sometimes when they’re complex and I make documentation for me or my colleagues.\n What do you think ? Do you have to do it in your jobs or did you ?

I'm in the UK so of course the conversion rate plays a increasingly smaller factor in that, but I earn nowhere near that.\n It's highly likely that these sys admins do a lot more than me, but it got me thinking... What do you sys admins actually do in a fairly regular day to day? I'm hoping it might give me some ideas of what I want to do/what to expect as I further my career.

They're moving the mails manually from Inbox to the archive but that's just delaying the inevitable because the archive has a 50Gb max capacity.\n How can I solve this ?

          "description": "Hello There. I have a client that i have never worked with before that has asked me to advise them on modernising their IdP. They currently have a combination of Active Directory, synching to AzureAD, but using ADFS for Auth. In addition to using ADFS for 365 authentication, they are also using several other applications (box.com for example) as well as using LDAP against the on-prem for some on-prem apps.\n They are eager to move to AzureAD (or another cloud IdP) to remove dependency on On-Prem.\n My thinking is that each app that uses ADFS is going to be handled differently. And that each one needs to be \"cutover\", there is unlikely to be any way to stage or transition from one Identity source to another.\n For 365 and Sharepoint and other MS Apps, i plan to recommend using Staged Mode, as they have some automation and workflows that have the expected ADFS webpage hard coded into their authentication, so i will leave the identitites used there in ADFS until they are \"dev'd\" out.\n Staging mode should in no way affect the third party apps, am i correct?\n My method is along the lines of \n Enable PHS in ADConnect & Seamless SSO -> Enable Staging Mode -> Migrate majority of Human Users to Staging Group (I can move the Automation Accounts as their devs update the app to support this)\n The above has no impact on the 3rd party apps, correct?\n But what about if/when i change my domain in AzureAD away from Federated to Managed? Does that impact?\n Ive been doing a lot of reading, and seen plenty of people say that they read too much into this, it ended up not being as complicated as expected.

          "description": "I am considering methods to connect remotely to my iMac across the internet from an iPad Pro. Ideally I will avoid services that enable the connection via an unrestricted server (udp holepunch) even when the service is advertised as encrypted (so teamviewer, jump and even vpns are excluded).\n I prefer direct connections (ssh for terminal access and rdp for the windows but don't like the risk associated with port forwarding. My solution is to implement tcp wrapper on the server and either restrict the client access to the smallest range of IP addresses from whichever location I am at or each time I connect, restrict the IP address to my actual IP address at the time. To configure the tcp wrapper I would connect to the server using jump and then once I have configured it take down that connection and then come in directly using rdp and ssh (with access restricted to my remote IP address only). The jump “daemon” will run for 5 minutes periodically (say, once or twice an hour) so the jump connection will only be available within that window.\n In summary use the udp holepunch style services (jump, Team viewer, vpn) as a way of initialising the direct connection and as a backdoor route if I manage to lock myself out but do 99% of my connectivity directly. If I am able to restrict access to just the range of IP addresses used by whatever ISP I am coming in from, I might only have to configure tcp_wrapper once for each ISP from which I am connecting. If that isn't viable, I am cool with re-initialising each time my remote IP changes.\n I should add that all my important passwords are 16 chars in length and all have lower case, upper case, numbers and special chars so I feel fairly protected against brute force attacks.\n what do you think of this plan?\n thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/macseguro  \n [link]   [comments]",

They were inexpensive, and held up for the most part. \n TrippLite is no longer selling to us direct as they are part of EATON now. and sales is through distribution like everyone else. This is fine, but with that costs go up. \n But what about other brands? I see tons out there now and just don't have experience with anything other than TrippLite and APC (now part of Schneider). \n I've installed a couple CyberPower units, and the first one I got failed in the first week. They RMA'd it and covered return shipping, but it meant a 4 hour drive to swap and swap back..

Getting the client out is easy enough (deployment solution)... but like everywhere else in the last two years our workforce has scattered across the country lol. The deployment could take a week or two to complete and for some units we may want to be a bit more aggressive on the timeline to rollout.\n Also, any thoughts on this being deployed for servers? Again... this seems pretty strait forward assuming avoiding things like domain controllers/etc. Any other big gotchas we should be looking for/might see?\n Should have added...most of our environments are fairly simple domains but some are wide spread.

I can find plenty of pros and cons online about the general features and performance of each platform but I have a very specific concern about this potential switch over and that is the control and admin of the cloud recordings, let me explain.\n Zoom has a wonderful admin interface that allows us to see all cloud recordings in one place, this is used mainly in our Sales department. It is especially helpful when a user leaves the business, we are able to transfer all their Zoom cloud recordings to their line manager as we delete their Zoom account with ease.\n Google Meet seems to have a very bare bones approach to Meeting recordings. By default it will just save a recording to the meeting hosts Gdrive and that's it, no option to transfer to another user (i.e their manager) and no centralised control over these recordings.\n ​\n Am I totally seeing this wrong or is Zoom the clear winner in recording management with the meetings and calls?\n    submitted by    /u/Helpdesk_Peon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I couldnt find any up/downscaling settings in neither of setup utilities.\n Is dpi the problem here and if so, is there any trick to upscale printouts with zebra label printers?\n    submitted by    /u/hegysk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Reddit! This is a question for all you experienced sysAdmins.\n I am planning a on-premise server setup and have a question mainly about user management. This is for a future production environment. I am taking the sysadmin role in a small company and I originally learned computer sciences with a focus on application development, so while I know the basics I am missing a lot of experience with implementing servers. \n What I want to do:\n I'll have a central Ubuntu server that runs as a NAS and possibly run VMs for workloads (simulations, renders and a database). I need to manage permissions for user groups and individual users. I also want access via VPN for homeoffice users and would like to manage a universal login for every user (would be perfect to be able to import these) and not have several logins. \n I am aware of Windows Active Directory but since I decided not to bother with Windows as my server OS (mainly because of licensing and compatible database software) I want to do that on a Linux Server. \n Basically I want to manage access so that only specific groups of users or specific users can access certain folders, thats the most important thing right now. There are aproximately 30 users but the number will grow in the future. Clients are all using Windows and if I could use the windows login as authentication for server access that would be perfect.\n Its my first time planning a complex server setup from scratch with user management, but I want it to be well plannned and documented, so any help and advice would be appreciated. I am open to suggestions about the general server or network architecture and the software I'll use, but my Hardware needs to at least host a NAS, a DBMS and ideally a VM.\n Please let me know if anny more information is necessary and thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/tho3maxi  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're moving a government org into M365 and maintaining and upgrading other server infrastructure stuff, and it is sooooo nice having two levels of IT helpdesk BEFORE tickets get to me!\n Also, there's a bit of fear looking at new systems I am now responsible for running (Airwatch, eDiscovery and Purview, Security, etc), but then super fun getting to dive in, learn the magic isn't inscrutable, show my ability to pick stuff up quickly and contribute, share the load with my awesome, and very-much-more-experienced-in-many-ways team, and they clearly appreciate the value I'm bringing, even as a totally new person to their org and team.\n Not knocking my prior gigs. They were good, the teams were good, we did good work together. This is not a whole 'nother level from what I've done before, but I'm not out of my depth, it's just a bigger challenge and I'm having loads of fun in an environment that seems to really want its members to succeed.\n Also today I helped in my first real security remediation, and using Security and Purview audit logs I was able to piece together the critical info showing how the email made it to an inbox, and confirmed what data we need to do that so much more quickly next time.

I send them a message telling them to let me know once they're done so I can get started. 9:45 rolls around and nothing. I assume it's going bad so I offered to help. Nothing. I contact the pm.

Anyway I have a pretty serious problem I think and would def appreciate some advice. \n So the company I’m working for conducts certification training and has 100 or so workstations (split between 15 corporate employees and 85 student computers). Every computer has windows 10 enterprise installed but I have no clue where the licensing information is. The computers are also so old there’s no original license key burned into the motherboard. The admin who set this all up died and his replacement was clueless. When a computer needed to be reimaged he used keys from visual studio :( (all I can do is put a sad face here). \n So here’s my question, am I right to assume that I would need to contact a license broker and purchase a windows 10 pro volume OEM license? Does anyone have any idea how much that might cost for 100 computers? \n Also, I think enterprise would be better for the corporate employees. We already have E3 licenses and are a silver partner with Microsoft. Once there’s a legit windows installation and the machine is added in azure I think that would check that block, but would there be any reason to also upgrade student computer from pro to enterprise (I don’t think so)?\n    submitted by    /u/hihcadore  \n [link]   [comments]",

The company is also trying to hire additional employees and I think it may be important to get another IT person soon. So all in all I do see a ticket system as an improvement.\n The problem is that my boss or anyone else in this company doesn’t know anything about IT and he doesn’t understand that I’m doing more than just fixing the users outlook problems because he just sees everything running fine and doesn’t know what goes into that. Because of that I fear that him seeing only a few support tickets coming in per day will lead him to believe that I don’t work enough. In reality I’m both trying to fix everything my predecessor implemented badly and without any documentation while keeping everything running and researching into improvements. But that can’t be put into tickets he can track.\n Would you recommend a full ticket system like Freshdesk in this situation?

The server version of popular products like Confluence and Jira are no longer to be sold and everyone has to join them in the cloud. Shouldn't be a problem, right? Both are server-driven products that are displayed in web browsers. I bet the interfaces are identical. \n WRONG, SCRUB! They split the code bases and the products barely resemble each other. Whole layout and functionality is different. And boy do they know how to screw things up. \n Like the multimedia macro? Tough luck. It's been removed from cloud. So if you, say, migrate a server site with videos to the cloud all your multimedia macros are broken. Ok, so how do you link the uploaded video on the page back to the page? See, if you had the multimedia macro you'd just put the macro on the page and select the video. \n Well, what you do is you download the videos to your hard drive and then drag and drop them back to the site and then delete the duplicate videos that are now attached.\n Seriously? Did I get this wrong or is this the official answer coming from support? \n Official answer. There's two feature requests related to fixing this feature gap, one is from 2018 and the other from 2019. \n And that's how it goes. Plenty of feature requests out there and if you think anything's going to happen on them then I've got swampland in Florida to sell you. \n This is an incredibly frustrating trend in software these days.

Simple task, user needs printer/scanner installing. It's an older HP so probably won't be too much of a bastard to sort. Log on, no admin access for some reason, looks like Intune hadn't been applying the settings, and of course, Intune gives 0 useful information as to why. So it's possible the user is still an admin. Try to get him to elevate, he's not doing it and keeps cancelling, then he brings up HP Smart and disappears for 20 minutes and I get disconnected.

We will need 7 headsets, and what is worse, 7 users taking us to quite a monthly tariff considering that we are not using more than 200 minutes/month.\n At this point, if anyone has an idea of how to set this up without advanced setup knowledge, that would be amazing.

          "description": "I've altered some information below and made it generic so as to be less recognizable.\n I was in a technology meeting where Really Bad Idea™ was proposed. At the time, I told them such and normally my opinions have weight, but this time I was outnumbered and they were locked in. Another in my cohort at this meeting, we will call him Mr. Z, is the kind of person who gleefully runs and does whatever upper management asks. He was as much for it as I was against it. So this thing got legs and ran.\n It's my role to sell some of these upper management decisions to the group, and do what was needed to make them successful. This time that wasn't possible. It was too draconian. It directly impacted people and their time. All I could do was offer some help. But I presented it as neutrally as possible so as not to throw anyone under the bus because it's just never good to openly do so. As a result they thought I initiated it, which normally I live with but this time was different.\n When the complaints from the field started coming in, people didn't want to say anything to me directly so they went to Mr. Z much to my surprise. Mr. Z then didn't own up to the fact that he was a big part of why this idea went forward. He just quietly listened, sympathized, and then went about his day. I know this because I overheard one of these conversations.\n At that point I called a WebEx with everyone in the field, apologized for the nightmare and the impact it had, and gathered data with all of their feedback on the recent issue. Everyone was 100% against it and all of the suggestions to fix it aligned. I then presented that data to upper management and requested to make modifications to the idea so it could work. It was more work to fix it but it needed to be fixed with urgency.\n This crisis was averted, but it cost valuable time and had an impact on my street cred. It sucked.\n    submitted by    /u/Goldin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Previous thread\n When last I posted here on the topic, prior to the Christmas break, I was being pressured into shunting all of my IT stuff into a broom closet. My direct supervisor is the 2nd in command for the whole school system, and he became more and more furious over this request as I brought it up to him over our break. He clearly is on my side in this, which means case closed, it's not happening. \n I've chatted up the admin at the high school since on numerous occasions, and it has never once come up in conversation. Having 6 carts full of laptops charging in the room every day has helped, as there would be no space at all for this stuff. Between that, a laminator, a sound system for our gym, and countless spare machines, it would be impossible to fit all that stuff into their proposed \"space\", never mind trying to cram a pair of bodies in there with our desks to boot. \n All in all, I wanted to update everyone to let you all know that it worked, and that I am still master of my domain (puns for days). I know my employees appreciate my hard line I took in this matter, but I also wanted to thank all of you for supporting my choices in this matter. It's one of my highest rated posts on here, and I got a lot of great feedback from members of this sub. IT people deserve better than the crap we get from most people, and all the IT folks I talk to, even in conversations today, agree with me. We are not often treated with respect and dignity, but I'm not going to let that happen on my watch, with my staff, for as long as I am employed here. \n So thanks again, and feel free to comment or message me any questions you might have about working on a First Nations reserve, or in a FN school. I know my living and working situation is unique, so don't be shy.\n    submitted by    /u/Mikash33  \n [link]   [comments]",

To that end, we currently have communication between client workstations blocked so they can only communicate with servers.\n We've tried to go further by even reducing that to only necessary services. For example, we've blocked client workstations from communication with servers via SMB ports 139 and 445 (obviously with a few exceptions such as our file server and Domain Controller).\n Now, running our last port scan, I see we still have port 135 open from workstations to servers. Can I safely block that?\n My understanding is it is used for RPC and remote management. Ideally what I am trying to set up is to block all remote management like RDP, WinRM, etc to my servers from ordinary client workstations and only allow it from a bastion host.\n I know you should not block it between servers like DCs because that will break replication.

He sends the mail to our client.\n However, now the mail he has send is showing up in the shared mailbox sent items. Every user can now read the mail in send items. It shows the personal from adres from our user. For me this is 100% reproducible, as i take the same steps. I would expect the reciever to get the mail as send on behalf of the shared mailbox, but to the reciever it shows as a mail recieved by the personal mailbox. The header of the mail also has no sign what so ever from the shared mailbox. \n Now this is kinda a red flag, as this would mean that user in our organisation might think he is typing a private message to someone else, only to show up in the sent items of the shared mailbox..\n What am I missing?

It must either integrate with M365 or just be a solution native to the platform. Ideally folks would be able to track changes to the policy with different versions to see what's changed, and maybe get an alert when there is a new or updated policy.\n I figure I could do most of this with SharePoint but feels like I'd be building a lot of it from scratch.

I remoted in and checked vsphere and sure enough, one of the three hosts at that site had a connection state issue. I acknowledged the alarm and checked the VPN circuit. It was pegged out (some type of NAS backup was running, this is not unusual). I cancelled the backup and the circuit went back to a normal state.\n I was thinking that host 1 would come back but it never did. I tried signing into ESXi through the web interface for the host, but the connection would time out on the page after putting in my credentials and hitting login. Tried SSH and I would get a connection refused. Logged in through iDRAC, rebooted the host. It came up without issue.\n So then, this happens on another host, we will call it host 2. Same deal, same site. I also cannot log into ESXi. I ended up getting into the iDRAC and rebooting the host. When it came up, it resynced and all was well. \n FAST FORWARD AN HOUR LATER.\n I get an alarm that the third host is down and that an HA Event had failed. I logged in, one of my datastores is inaccessible and the third host is now down. This one, I cannot even get into the iDRAC, web interface or SSH.\n I got someone that was near the site to go and reboot the host manually from the rack, it came back up without issue. As for the datastore, I went into the connection & multipathing screen and had to manually mount it back to the first 2 hosts that we rebooted.\n All is back up and no alarms. I had generated support bundles to have VMWare check on this monday. Wow what a Saturday.\n    submitted by    /u/Weak-Peak1015  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I was just offered another role through a different company, fully remote sysadmin for about $85,000/yr. \n My questions are mainly... based on anyone else's experience in sysadmin work in the Midwest, should I try to aim for closer to $90k based on my experience? \n Should I just shut up and take the money?? Or should I aim higher for somewhere between $90k-$100k?\n (This is my first time specifically doing work with a \"sysadmin\" title, but been performing the same work through other roles I've held in recent years)\n I've looked up some Glassdoor avg salaries for the title but it was a pretty wide range, something like 55k-120k/yr?\n If anyone can help me out with this I'd really appreciate it as I'm trying to pursue making a big change in my life and move towards settling down and building a family with my fiancee.

Is there something special about them? \n - For example are they optimized for providing lower power over more time? This would make sense for network equipment, whereas computer UPSs are made to keep a desktop computer going at full power for just enought time to shut down. Or would a bigger UPS designed for a computer simply last longer when powering low-power devices?\n ​\n - Might there be safety/fire precautions on these that aren't on regular UPSs? \n - Any other reasons I might pay extra per watt of power output for one of thse \"telecom\" UPSs?\n    submitted by    /u/nKephalos  \n [link]   [comments]",

The PSU works when using a C13/C14 cord in this PDU. I don't want to use this PDU.\n Question:\n Can someone give a quick explanation of these power requirements/specs on the PSU? My interpretation is that the PSU supports 120V thus a NEMA 5-15/NEMA 5-20 cable should be enough to power the PSU.\n Am I misinterpreting the specs or does the PSU have some sort of sensing ability to know that an IEC plug is not being used?

Earlier this week at my workplace I had a iSCSI target from a Synology RackStation RS3614xs+ NAS (DSM 6.2.2-24922) suddenly disconnect overnight on a Windows Server. When I started investigating after noticing the issue, DSM tells me in the storage manager that \"There is no volume in your system\". 12-disk RAID6 is fine, alive and healthy, S.M.A.R.T. of all disks displays a \"Normal/Healthy\" status so nothing to worry about I think (only 1 disk mentioned 1 bad sector at the time after the sudden target disconnect). Storage pool is also operating normally from what DSM shows.\n I can still access the target, the data is still there but this volume \"missing\" in DSM is getting me a little worried.\n Every other RackStation NAS (configured with iSCSI/LUNs) we have currently running and everything I see on the web says that on a Synology NAS a LUN is located on a volume (like Volume 1) and not straight on a storage pool.\n I'm no expert in storage topics and still learning but everything I see in my investigation of the issue points in the direction that this is not a normal behavior. I searched on the web for a similar experience and cannot find cases where LUNs point straight to storage pool location instead of like an ext4 volume for example.\n What are your thoughts about this?\n Please let me know if additional context and details (even logs or output of CLI commands) are needed.\n Thanks in advance for your insight, and have a nice day!\n    submitted by    /u/gtkshroom  \n [link]   [comments]",

There's just too many laptops\n Solution I was thinking- We will go to every laptop this time make sure we push the bios config to power on every Sunday- SCCM will do the updates for us just like how we always been..\n Any recommendations or advice as well from your own solutions that is keeping your laptop's updated in their carts? Any GPO's that we can push to the laptops as well. The laptops are always plugged with power via the usb-c power adapters. We have ap's in every room that has a laptop cart.\n Its just getting tiresome to do all hunt down the ones that hasn't been patched manually as the #of laptops is growing and its not all in the same building.

I can't get it together anymore.\n Though, from my old companies I know that they all put their default gateway at the beginning of a network, e.g. 192.168.178.1/24\n What do you think?

I've tried the usual UWP kiosk powershell in Windows but Spotify is strange in that it appears it is now an plug-in for the xbox game bar UWP app. It can't be found in the GUI to set up a kiosk app, and if you try to run SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Spotify it just gets stuck in a loop until I remote powershell in and remove the kiosk setting. If you use SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Widget it displays \"We weren't able to start your app.\" and an error code which indicates an operation was not supported.\n I've considered Edge fullscreen but the web-based can only cast to Spotify Connect devices they've previously registered and as this is at a school, giving access to an unauthenticated web browser is something I'd rather avoid.\n Another potential is BlissOS (Androidx86) but then I need to put in time to get that working with an MDM if it is even possible.\n If I can get it working, I'll design a secure-ish wall mount and 3D print as many as needed. (we have 30 of them) I was also considering using them for control panels for certain building automations (is there a more commercial focused option like homeassistant?) and also for using with Xibo for digital signage.\n Background: I'm the solo IT person for a special school, always looking for cheaper ways of doing things which make these kids' lives a bit better. The more I can save, the more I can spend on IT based programs which help their learning. If I had loads of money, I'd just buy iPads for this.

And in the moment you don't quite believe whats happening yourself.\n So, this school they have a 40mbps VDSL line. As you can imagine with over 200 devices on the network at times this is pretty slow. Today the download speed was 0.4 mbps with a 800ms ping. How they survive on this I will never know. I'm constantly trying to get them to upgrade to fibre but they just do not have the budget to do that. There network equipment is a mess too, they have a Dell Sonicwall router about 12 year old and Cisco switches from about 10 years ago. They recently upgraded a couple of switches to unifi and how have unifi ac pro access points.\n ​\n Today I was going round seeing if anyone had any issues in their classrooms and a staff member approached me asking why they had been asked to turn off ALL devices in their class. I walked around and everybody was turning all their devices off, it felt like apocalypse scene in a movie. The person who told them to turn everything off I went and asked her why this had happened and her response was \"I needed to download a large file and the internet is too slow\". I couldn't stop laughing. I had never heard of anything so outrageous in my life. The funny thing was, 75% devices dropped off the network and the speed was 2mbps download. \n ​\n Its so hard working with schools to improve their tech when they quite literally don't have the budget to upgrade stuff.

We have it configured for the Windows pre-logon as well, and we instruct people to sign into the VPN at the login screen of the computer.

The company I work at has been very stable, work life balance is excellent with typically no more then 40 hours per week, remote 4 days per week, have 6 weeks of vacation, and the other benefits (7% 401k matching, health care is under $200 a month for a family, bonus is usually around $7k) are good as well. I've seen some other job listings in my field would offer a good bump in pay but I'm hesitant to even leave. I start thinking \"Is now the right time to really leave with the way the economy is\", and \"my wife and I having a baby on the way, stay where it's been stable\". On the other hand I also think \"I've been here nearly 15 years, let's see what's out there and what I'm worth\".

          "description": "I'm running one of my first projects as a SysAdmin(well, as an Enterprise level SysAdmin, I've done little projects like getting a small office of about 15 people setup for remote work when Covid hit), and thats running a pilot program for migrating users from Windows 10 to Windows 11. \n I've already created a guide for the actual process of setting up Win 11 on their new laptops, but I still wanted to create a little fact sheet of changes between Windows 10 and 11. This is for an insurance company, so the changes should be focused more on GUI changes rather than changes to things like performance or new widgets(for the most part, if the software isn't in our Company Portal, we don't want them installing it anyway). \n I personally haven't used Win 11 that much(the project kind of got sprung on me short notice) so simply writing the differences I've noticed might not be too helpful and most articles I've read only give a nod towards look and feel changes then focus on things like gaming performance. \n I don't mind doing the actual reading myself, so links will be enough, but if anyone has brief summaries of changes, that would also help immensely.

As we are moving out of sccm to WS1, our security department is quite demanding regarding our packaging standards.\n Basically, in our packages we might have \"sensitive information\" ( licence server , accounts , database ...) Plainly visible in scripts ( most of time we are using PSADT ) and they want us to encrypt / hide as much as possible these data. \n File Encryption seems quite difficult to setup for such purposes (due to find a way to make the package usable through WS1, and decrypt it on devices !) , Hide through full encapsulation in .MST / MSI might cause tons of rework and aditiional loads...

They use some in-built 4g connectivity when out and about.\n The issue is that when in patchy signal, the AOVPN tries a few times to connect and then stops trying to auto-connect.\n This appears to happen only for Windows 11 devices. There doesn't appear to be a GPO option to force the auto-connect functionality back on.\n Another issue is that we can't disable the option to untick 'Connect Automatically', so the user can untick it and the VPN won't automatically connect. Is there any GPO or setting that I'm missing which will help? \n I'm aware that this is a 'minor' inconvenience which could be solved with User Training but management have insisted that these field engineers are dumb as bricks and will just complain so it's easier to just get the VPN to try all the time constantly.\n I'm looking into a scheduled task fired on Network Connection successful but wanted a second opinion.

          "description": "Hello fellow sysadmins, I need to run a sanity check hope you can shed some light.\n I've inherited an environment, I'm still discovering and learning about it. It's an on-prem bare-metal/VMware, public cloud is minimal and completely independant. One concern that I have is that I'm seen some odd DHCP reservations for productions servers.\n To give an idea, I've seen DHCP reservation for MS-SQL database server, Domain controllers (all of them), Application Servers, anything that seems to be a production server where many people connect to, it is likely to have a reservation.\n Then in some cases, not all of them, the server has a static IP address assigned, despite of having a reservation. And you probably guess it, the IP address statically assigned to that server is in the DHCP range where other Desktop computers are also connected. This causes that the DHCP report the reservation as inactive.\n From the other side of the fence the monitoring system which is simple doing ICMP every once in awhile detects that host is down. There are no connectivity problems in some occasions when I manually check.\n In some other instances the ESXi web UI is inaccessible, I've experienced myself a duplicate IP caused by one of my computers that took the exact reserved IP address which belongs to that ESXi.\n My question is simple. Is this a normal practice to heavily rely on DHCP reservations to manage mission critical servers IP addressing? My personal bias to decimate that configuration. Go back to traditional static IP addressing, pushing the DHCP range to leave room for server addressing.\n On what scenarios a DHCP reservation would make sense to keep when dealing with servers that run network services that should be available to employees.\n    submitted by    /u/Proper-Obligation-97  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, hoping to get some pointers on a planned SharePoint migration. Mainly around Teams setup as each site will likely be Teams enabled.\n I understand there are varying degrees of complexity depending on depth of Teams integration but have narrowed it down to 3 options.\n  \nSetup each department with their own site and dump folders alongside General. No private channels at this stage but, if setup down the line, there'll be nothing in General for users who are added (I understand the new Shared Channel option fixes this but seems fine to just keep everything alongside General anyway. Users can't delete the General folder but can delete the contents).\n Setup one site and create Private channels for the various departments. Easier to manage from a permissions standpoint as we can delegate channel owners to add and remove members. Downside is limit on number of private channels per team (will probably be under that though). I can map private channels to File Explorer but the name doubles-up (can fix this by customising the desktop.ini file).\n Let SharePoint migration tool dump everything to one site and call it a day. Deal with permission changes as needed.\n  \nAlso keen on references to other guides or scripts for checking file conflicts outside of the SharePoint migration tool. Been trying to research best practices for a while but the info keeps changing since the platform keeps evolving. Also saw a guide about using metadata rather than folders so they're accessible from more than one location but that seems like even more work/complexity.\n TIA\n    submitted by    /u/Ssufferin_Ssuccotash  \n [link]   [comments]",

That being said, a few duties of my job include, maintaining the corporate network, maintaining our cyber risk standards (updates, anti-virus, MFA, etcetc), and Helpdesk for other employees.\n What's interesting is that over the year, I've been introduced into a few of the other random things IT 'takes care' of.\n We have 2 restaurants in the building that both use an outdated POS system. The guy who maintained the backend left a few months back, so now I'm in control of adding food buttons, prices, taxes and making sure the numbers match in the reports. (That should be a finance dept. thing)\n I'm being trained in SQL, so that I can be a backup once our programmer leaves. But I really don't care for programming. We're looking into Interns/hiring so I don't understand why we just find someone who likes SQL.\n I also have to setup most of the meetings for the execs; Which I'm not really surprised about. Just annoying as it takes me away from what I was working on especially on their 'meeting days'.\n And, I've been making the graphics for a few displays in our employee break rooms that include whatever deals we currently have for employees, position postings, inspirational posts. We have a marketing\\graphics team, but I think they don't even know about them.\n This seems to be a thing that happens in all departments though. My friend in Marketing gets the 'privilege' of driving the co-owner home when he has a fun night at the bar. Keep in mind the drive is 45 mins there and 45 back. And our AV guy has to change the movie that plays on loop in the co-owner's office whenever he calls.\n Overall it's a interesting place to work. Anyone else have some whacky side duties you got stuck with?\n    submitted by    /u/NollerReal  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems to work fine for smaller sites, but the larger the customer, the more problems they have with it.\n I am migrating on prem shares into Sharepoint - giving each share its own site. I then either deploy the share via Intune so that it appears in the Explorer sidebar, or simply have the customer \"add shortcut to OneDrive\" \n The thing is, I'm constantly having OneDrive sync issues. Either it gets stuck syncing, doesn't sync everything, gives errors when downloading cloud files through explorer etc, and it's overall a very poor experience for the customer. \n Doing things via the web browser is fine, but doesn't offer the old school functionality of accessing files via explorer.\n What am I doing wrong?

This is fine, I've created the relevant DNS records and such, and all is well. However, the way Mailchimp links images rather than embeds means that Outlook doesn't display images by default. The only way around this, that I'm aware off, is to set the sender in Safe (Trusted) Senders and Domains for all users\n I've done this via a PowerShell script:\n ``` Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName user@example.com \n $users = Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox \n foreach ($user in $users) {\n Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration \"$($user.UserPrincipalName)\" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add=\"mail.example.com\"} }\n ```\n I have also try to only do one user, eg. Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration \"user@example.com\" -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add=\"mail.example.com\"}\n Either way I do this though, the change shows up when I look at junk settings in OWA or Outlook 365 desktop, but within 10 minutes, it's no longer in there, almost as if the change has been undone\n If I manually add the domain to my safe senders list, it remains there absolutely fine, so I don't believe this is some rogue setting or script that's clearing out the safe senders list\n    submitted by    /u/DeifniteProfessional  \n [link]   [comments]",

RAM wise also about 60 %. Disk i/o and network are not real latency. \n The problems for the users are mostly slow responding applications (not crashing) while moving the windows, latency on typing in different applications, and some other stuff. \n For a small test i removed our anti virus (Sophos) but that does not help.\n If i read some old threads here on reddit most other people have much more user per server without issues. So it does not seem an issue on the user/server ratio.\n ATM i'm thinking about buying a hardware server with an GPU to test it. Hyper-V does not really support GPU partitioning or passthrough.

It didn’t. Awesome.\n Now: DC1 is online, DC2 is offline but never demoted (and VM has no NIC config), DC02 (new VM) is a trigger pull away from backing up DC1.\n Questions: 1) If I add DC02 as a DC to the domain using “any dc” as a replication source, can I change this later? (Because I might like to make this “only DC1,” temporarily, which brings us to… 2) I want to bring DC2 online to properly demote it, but how can I ensure it won’t torpedo DC1 with bad/redundant records as soon as they reunite? Can I just (while DC2 still has no network config) set their sync relationship to be 1-way, give it network access again, demote it, shut it down for good? 3) Depending on 2)’s answer, should DC02 be held offline and not joined to the domain until DC2 is gone for good? Or is it safer to add it, test it, then shut it down while sorting DC1&2 so that, if they implode, I can just shut them down and bring up DC02?\n    submitted by    /u/GreatContagion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Dehydrated and its helpers are all bash scripts, so I was able to throw set -o xtrace at the top to see what bash was running, and this was the offending block:\n cliip=`$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip` while ! valid_ip $cliip; do sleep 2 cliip=`$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip` done \n This is a block of code in the Dehydrated helper script for Namecheap, that detects the running machine's IP. Except if the call fails, it gets stuck forever sleeping every 2 seconds and trying again. And as it turns out, the v4 and v6 subdomains to ifconfig.co were deprecated in 2018 and finally removed in January sometime.\n So the upshot is that v4.ifconfig.co/ip should be changed to ifconfig.co and your Dehydrated/Namecheap setup will come back to life.\n Also, set -o xtrace is a lifesaver for debugging Bash scripts that are getting stuck.\n    submitted by    /u/OrangeredStilton  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is very convenient since you don't need to dig up a phone to log in, it can be auto-filled, and easily backed up. However, this is significantly degrading the security of having the second factor in the first place.\n Why it matters: multi-factor authentication is predicated on distributing security into multiple areas, so an account compromise requires significantly more effort. Typically, factors are \"something you know\" (e.g. a password), \"something you have\" (e.g. a phone or hardware token), and \"something you are\" (e.g. a fingerprint or other biometrics).

Long time lurker here...\n I'm working on a moving project, we've rented a rack in a DC and want to move our whole infra there and I'd like to get rid of our tape library... I know they are immutable and great but I hate them and being the only guy that has to remember to buy, replace, store, and tag all the tapes is starting to suck.\n I've eyed this HPE storeOnce solution, we use Veeam for our backups, and the hypervisor is hyper-v (corporate decision) backups are running ok with a 3-2-1 approach, but as I said, being storeOnce with Catalyst kinda immutable I wanted to get feedback about this in order to hopefully switch to that instead of tapes. \n My main questions are:\n - is the deduplication that good? I've read about a 20:1 ratio (for storage planning)\n - has the catalyst technology ever created issues in your environment? Have you replaced other immutable backup means like tapes with that? \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Hornet89  \n [link]   [comments]",

And ideally this same company sells the services to execute too or there are recommendations on companies they take the results and offer services to fix and execute.\n Backstory: Recently joined a company as an executive and realize that its entire environment has been thrown together by a couple inexperienced IT support employees. No fault of their own, the company started mom and pop small business and rapidly exploded into a national player and these guys just kept the lights on. There is no asset management, no end point management, no understanding of how to streamline/control data, (literally zero governance), etc. To better know what we don’t know so we can add the right people to the existing team, we are hoping to pay lots of $$$$ to have a trusted company contracted to “fix” us up so we can take it from there.\n    submitted by    /u/Throwaway546473  \n [link]   [comments]",

Server1 is setup as a Hyper-V server hosting 4 vms (2016 servers) and roughly 15 TBs of data including an sql server that is the bulk of the data. \n Server2 is identical to Server1; processor, ram, partitions,etc. This is a fresh server, only Hyper V installed. I have not moved/copied over any vms or data data, just installed a the same roles and applied some updates. Figured over a weekend I’d save off the VMs and import them into server2 and robocopy daily to sync data. Would this work? \n My mission is to figure out a way to have the “in production” server1 in building A sync or mirror to server2 in building B (fiber). In the event of a disaster I’d be able to move server2 into production and keep folks working. Servers are on the same domain, network, vlan and can see one another. \n Is it possible to set server1 up to regularly sync everything including vms and their data to server2 in real-time or hourly/bi-hourly intervals using robocopy? I’m okay with daily, but hourly would be better. MS best practices? Not opposed to 3rd party software, but would prefer a free Microsoft option if available (limited resources). \n Any help is greatly appreciated.

          "description": "Hey, just a quick ramble and I am curious how others see this scenario since it is a very common one. We have about 1000 users in our environment, everyone works from home 3 days per week. The users connect to a VPN from home, just like almost every other company.\n We've had MFA rolled out for a long time with SMS authentication, but recently one of the C-suites was targeted in a SIM swap. We're now switching over to an authenticator-based solution which requires users to have an authenticator app on their phones. It has been going well, but we have a small handful of users (about 10) who are adamantly against using their phones for anything work-related. These users all have smartphones, so there is no technical limitation stopping them from being able to install the authenticator app.\n My ideology is that phones, like internet at home, or like transportation to and from work, are all things that an employee are expected to have. Everyone already understands that they can connect to their own home Wifi to then access our VPN and connect to our corporate network, and that is taking some bandwidth from their other devices. I'm not really seeing the difference between those two use cases as we aren't monitoring their phones, or adding any MDM solution to them. They could feel that way but I'd expect them to already feel that way by connecting a corporate laptop to their home network.\n I know most companies provide cell phones or stipends to employees for phone services if they are expected to use their phones for work purposes but no employee is expected to do anything besides receive a 6-digit code to authenticate when logging in to our systems.\n Management requested us to just set up a group for users who refuse to just leave their policy to only require SMS authentication.\n    submitted by    /u/Beznia  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's impossible to do that on servers, you have to use a customer's pc. And don't even try to connect a USB cable before completing the in-app procedure!\n Then half of those printers... they just doesn't work.\n A few of them doesn't connect to their \"HP Web Services\", the majority are stuck with a \"complete the configuration...\" message.

          "description": "Long time lurker, first time poster on this account, thanks for all the information shared. We have a corporate partner (CP) that manages an existing tenant. Meanwhile, we are our own standalone org and aren't required to use the CP's services. Being on enterprise M365 licenses, we've been able to use the Power Platform (Power Automate, Apps, BI, etc) with great success but we keep running hitting ceilings on what we can do without admin access.\n Some of those things would be account creation automation based on roles, dynamic group memberships, Azure AD (we have traditional on prem DC), SharePoint customization, use of Intune, etc. All that is cool, but when the C-Suite learned the CP can technically access all of our email, OneDrive, etc, they became very committed rolling our own tenant. \n So here we are! We've been reading up on implementing a non-routable domain into a hybrid Azure AD setup, email management, MFA setup, what the a transition looks like for our end users, etc but we all know academic knowledge vs implementation experience are two very different things. Fwiw, our CP is supportive of the transition so bad blood and politics shouldn't be a factor here.\n What are your thoughts on best practices, things you would be looking out for, general advice given this scenario? \n TL;DR We're moving away from a tenant managed by a 'provider' to our own in-house management, asking best practices, advice for setup, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/DucksAreOdd  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I never expect much from Microsoft Support, it usually takes plenty of back and forth before you can ever make progress if it ever does happen. But my last experience with them left me dumbfounded.\n I raised a ticket for an issue that inadvertently affected all of our mobile users, and upon their first email to me I was told it would be escalated to their intune team. I recieved one email from intune support asking to provide relevant information, then radio silence for the next 3 weeks. I sent maybe 4 followups asking when I would get a response, but to no avail.\n Fast forward to today, I finally get an email from them saying they have been trying to reach out to me but I must be busy so they will archive the ticket. Scrolling through the email thread, yes they have been \"trying to reach out\", but all of their emails after the initial one to gather more info were sent to my email address except with the domain slightly misspelled. The thread is full of NDR's.\n I find it hard to believe that someone employed as an intune specialist would not realize that receiving NDR's that my email address does not exist would not realize that I'm not receiving the emails. And what a coincidence that they finally got my email address correct when sending the case closure email. I guess their reply button must have been broken and causing my domain to be misspelled on all the emails where they try to offer assistance.\n Anyways I'm just here to rant, after several days and hundreds of re-enrollments we have gotten things under control.

          "description": "I work from home about 2/3rds of the time and spend the other 1/3rd in the office. When working from home I always RDP into my office workstation and for the most part I've had no issues. I have a 3 monitor setup at both work and home. The office workstation is almost 10 years old, and I'm attempting to upgrade to a newer box which is much better equipped but RDP access to the box is much slower, lags, and the most annoying thing is that upon connection the screen flashes black for a couple of minutes (but not every time) before finally settling down. Performance when physically at the box is good, definitely better than the 10yr old box. Both are in the same OU, Have the same Windows 10 Enterprise image, and have the same Group Policy applied. I've disabled the RDP hardware graphics acceleration which my research shows to be a cause of the flashing screen upon connection. I use RDP in the course of my daily routine on various devices and have never encountered an issue like this, RDP is generally something that just works and most of the time I can't even tell that I'm connected to a remote box. It doesn't appear to be a client side issue or a multi monitor issue, performance is consistent if I'm connected across the VPN or locally from any device and no errors are indicated in the event log. \n For a number of functional and psychological reasons I need a physical box that I use both when at home and at the office. Do you have any recommendations on how to improve RDP performance on this new box? \n Here are the specs:\n New:\n HPZ2 G9 i7-12700, 32GB ram, Nvidia RTX A2000\n Old:\n i7-3930K, 32GB ram, Nvidia GeForce GTX 660\n    submitted by    /u/jstar77  \n [link]   [comments]",

The LUN is published to all hosts, and that cannot be changed from the SAN (AFAIK).\n One of our people build two new hypervisors recently, both of which have attached this \"access\" disk along with the legitimate volumes they need. It appears in disk manager as a 20mb offline disk. Diskpart tells me it is set to be read only.\n The issue I can see is the system log being overrun with constant NTFS errors, all pointing to the GUID of this disk.\n I want to take this disk offline on the hosts, but not sure about any possible ramifications (it seems OK since it looks like some sort of named pipe style channel for use by the dell management utility), and not sure the safest way to remove the volume without affecting the other LUNs on the same iSCSI target.\n Does anyone have any hints or tips for me?\n Thanks for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/ExcellencePursuit  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't really find anything on this, it is easy to mitigate right now but the force shutdowns are going to take a toll.\n Thank you for any help!\n    submitted by    /u/justAcazyadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

This involved varied tasks such as helping the foundation crews break big rocks into smaller rocks, or pulling a softball sized wad of human shit and used tampons out of the building's sewage masticater by hand.

Because of this the users were already set up with beefy workstation laptops and docking stations at home and every office desk before I started at the company.\n The problem is that the CAD files are stored on a central fileserver in the office and when the users work remotely they work off an SMB connection to the office over VPN which results in extremely slow access speeds and file corruptions.\n I wanted to set them up with individual tower PCs at the office instead or at least a pool of a few PCs in the office and let them connect to those remotely with RDP. Though firstly the boss doesn’t like that option because he wants everyone to be able to work at every desk and secondly the test engineers complain about latency problems regarding their 3D work in programs like Revit and AutoCAD. For example they say rotating the view is too cumbersome over the remote connection. I’m currently testing parsec instead of RDP but that has similar problems and is quite buggy.\n So my question is, how do you make occasional remote work, preferably with laptops, work for resource heavy CAD users working from a shared network drive?\n    submitted by    /u/purplepersonality  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of those pins carrying PoE is bonded with the chassis, which I'm guessing is really a powder-coated metal. When you use the metal mounting plate and that is touching metal it makes a nice circuit, then the Ubiquity PoE switch shuts off PoE. \n The AP works great with a grounded or ungrounded patch to the biscuit jack, just as long as it isn't touching anything metal. Swapped it out with an AP that was working fine mounted to a plywood sheet just to be sure it exhibited the same symptoms. It did.\n Doing my best not to rant, we spent a lot of time on this.

Now, the last thing I want to do is go over his head to our CTO and I’ve asked him a few times if he was comfortable signing but keeps asking me to go back to the supplier and have them confirm the most minute of details which have no impact on him signing the proposal. Should I speak with my direct manager and ask his advice and maybe HE can push my director into signing it sooner rather than later?

I've seen cheap adapters like this but I'm unsure if they'll do what I need:https://www.amazon.com/Wixine-Board-Small-Adapter-SFF-8482/dp/B08DLX9YD5?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A1RV7R81U3FOKU\n Before I bought anything else I did want to see if the drive was working with what I already had laying around.I got a working T3600 with a working H310 for free last week that appears to have the latest software on it, but it couldn't see the SSD in Physical Disk Management. It had a SATA SSD in it for a boot drive and all of that worked fine before I went to switching things around. Although I'm quite certain Windows on the poor little Patriot SSD was corrupted at some point. RIP\n I could feel the U.2 slightly warm when it was plugged in which was a good sign. Physical Disk Management couldn't see it. I'm not sure if I need a new cable or other components to get this working correctly just so I can make sure the drive is good. I'm pretty green on this topic. Figured I'd come to the experts. I've done a good bit of research and asked r/IT what this even was to get the ball rolling in the right direction. I'm realizing how strange my request truly is. What would you do in my situation?\n    submitted by    /u/Jfunkey_  \n [link]   [comments]",

When an employee leaves the company, if the supervisor needs access to to their email account afterwards, we keep the user licensed and convert their email to a shared mailbox. We then remove the user license. After a month or so the supervisor will let us know that they no longer need access to the email and so we convert it back to a regular mailbox. As that user no longer has a license I assumed the inbox would disappear and senders would get a bounce back. Seems instead that the users inbox still exists and is receiving messages even though it is not licensed. I am not concerned with backups as we have that covered in another system. I am just curious what the correct method would be to remove the shared mailbox so that it disappears and users get a bounce back if they try to send to it.

          "description": "I stumbled across a feature in Windows Server 2022 called SMB Compression which, according to my understanding, allows quicker transfer of files over your network by compressing files (if you tell it to). The concept seems relatively straight forward, I think in practice you can use SMB Compression by:\n • Using Robocopy with a /compress switch in your CLI\n • Mapping a network drive using Net using the /requestcompression:yes switch\n • Enabling this option in the Windows Admin Center on a File Server so file copying will default to using compression when end users copy to or from the network share folder on a server with this option enabled.\n My question is - is my relative understanding of this feature, more or less, accurate? Also when it comes to file compression, don't you lose quality when it comes to files such as jpegs, or does it compress the files to transfer them, thus lowering bandwidth requirements, and then decompress the files once it reaches the destination?\n Is this feature relatively esoteric? There really seems like no downsides unless the files stay compressed. Any admins out there successfully utilize this? Thanks all.\n    submitted by    /u/TCIE  \n [link]   [comments]",

We got what we needed from them and kicked them out, and now have no contact.\n One of my requests to the MSP before departure was to remove us from their partner portal, as I have no ability to do that from the tenant. Surprise, this was never done! I've contacted MS \"support\" through the O365 admin page and they've basically told me to go fuck myself and it's stuck there forever. For luck I've put in about 20 tickets on this, one actually got close. I feel like MS can absolutely do this if I fill out 700 forms and what not. \n Is there any way I can get this relationship off the tenant? Every time I need to purchase licenses it gets in the way by two clicks, and I'm tired of being reminded that an MSP has us in their poral somewhere. Their access is neutered but it still feels like they're part of the setup when they aren't.\n    submitted by    /u/Timithius  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A little background. I started at this place fairly recently. Just prior to me starting, their accounting department decided to move from some antique accounting software, to using quickbooks. The sysadmin before me set them up with QB desktop and with the company files hosted on VM at a remote data center (which is a couple hundred miles away).\n Big surprise, the previous guy apparently never read the documentation from QB that clearly states accessing a company file over VPN is a shit show. Its massively slow. Like often taking 10+ minutes for a company file to open. To make things worse, the accounting department is using quickbooks in an unusual way, where they have hundreds of company files that all need to be accessible to the ~20 accountants. So throughout the day theyre switching between files and literally spending hours waiting on shit to load. Also, this means quickbooks online is not an option, because you pay per company file, and the service would be absurdly expensive.\n My first thought was to set up a NAS locally and based on some testing, this works great. Its nearly as fast as having the company files on the host. But to throw another wrench in things, the accountants often need to work from home. The DC and ASA are at the data center, and when using VPN from home theyre tunneling all the way to this data center and then all the way back to our office. This is actually so slow that most of the time you cant even open a company file.\n I know the proper solution is to run QB in a VM and use RDS, which I could easily do at our data center, but for whatever reason my boss is vehemently against this option.\n At this point I kind of at a loss.

For instance, we have a client who has an office attached to their house and they all share the same network. It was deemed by my bosses that the reason the office was experiencing slow connections within the application they use is because of the switch they were using. That something might have \"happened\" to it or it went bad. They proceeded to buy 2 switches: 1 for the home network and the other for the office network. I traced the offices lines, plugged each respective line into the dedicated switches and plugged them into the ports I was told to in their firewall. \n After everything was all said and done, I come back to the office and asked my supervisor \"couldn't we have just made things easier by using one switch and separate the network using VLANS?\". He responded \"Well, if something were to happen to the switch, such as a shock to the system, the switch would reset & lose all configurations which would cause havoc\". I was sitting there thinking to myself....well then by that reasoning, why everything else? Everything in tech is just as susceptible to that scenario. If you propose that scenario, then why even have managed switches? \n I recognize that that is an extreme scenario he gave but how realistic is that? Has that ever happened to anyone?

Network C is the main network, and Network X is the secondary network I have in my office to remote into other off sites.\n Once I captured the scans they appear to be completely different ways of communicating. I can see the the app on the C network communicates using HTTP 1.1 and it goes through a few hoops. I can see the app on X network communicates via DNS. The scans for X Network do not show HTTP linked to this app at all and the scans for C Network do not show DNS at all. The DNS method is much quicker than the HTTP method.\n My question is does that mean that the older C Network is using older/different networking protocols to launch/connect to the app? Does that mean that our newer X Network is using a DNS network to automatically connect the app each time making it quicker?\n I would post the scans but there's confidential information in the data.\n    submitted by    /u/moderatenerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, at our company I was tasked with finding a RMA software solution for managing defective products returns that we could implement locally or (preferably) buy a cloud solution. We don't have big requirements so the software should (at least) be able to connect to our existing local ERP, to get customer and our products data, should support/have built-in RMA forms for customers to send us their RMA requests and get RMA progress updates (optionally some sort of barebone ticketing system or simply sending update e-mails) and have scheduled or ondemand reporting capability for our management (so we can identify products with most defects, what are those defects, etc.).\n We are not a big company with only around 50 employees, but have quite a few customers (we manufacture products for customers) so the software solution should be a reliable one.\n Thank you in advance for your recommendations!\n    submitted by    /u/Red-dy-20  \n [link]   [comments]",

We wanted Intune or a similar solution so we can finally move away from having to type in a users password (especially if they already work for us) and setup the laptop manually. Got rejected for it being too expensive for everyone. On my question on how we should move forward with this as setting up laptops manually takes a lot of time, time which we could use for productive work, they told us to just hire students.\n This will be fun when we up our workforce by roughly a third this year and have them all start working on the same day. This will totally work and we will totally won't have issues with this approach, because giving some random students laptops with little to no possible oversight who are doing a brain-dead task will work out.\n So any ideas on other solutions? We will have to deploy devices on a regular basis for all offices and a person having to wait 1-2 business days to work again (us shipping them a device from HQ or in that office a student being there setting up a device) is not an option\n    submitted by    /u/Auno94  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a systems engineer for a national healthcare company. We recently decom'd a data center and used a company to relocate a piece of hardware to another one of our datacenters several states away, and used a second company to take away the remaining old decom'd hardware that we no longer needed.\n I've handled nearly all of the quoting, selections, and coordination during this process. On the day for both companies to perform their duties, it was just a disaster. Neither company should've had the problems that they had, putting us in situations we shouldn't have had to be in. This is not the first time I've dealt with bad IT recycling companies...\n It got me thinking and throwing an idea around with a couple of friends. One, an owner of a small trucking company, and another who's a CPA and a part-time small business owner. We're thinking of forming an IT relocation, destruction, and recycling company.\n What issues have you had dealing with these companies? What kind if services are you looking for in such a company? Are you looking for such a company to quickly and simply haul away your old equipment, or do you have equipment of value that you no longer need, and want to have such a company pay some for it to be able to resell? Do you only care about certificates of destruction? Do you want said company to do all the labor, un-racking all your old gear and handle the entire decom/relocation process, or simply have them pick up the already removed hardware, ready to go at the dock? What's most important to you? If quotes of two companies were identical, what would make you choose one over the other? \n It seems like there's a lot of players in the industry, but I haven't had a company provide these services without throwing wrenches into the works. To err is human, but a lot of the mistakes and issues I've seen are completely avoidable. I can do better.\n You wanna talk me out of it? Why? You wanna talk me into it?

Our environment is a hybrid AD/Azure AD and due to the nature of our business we will likely remain that way for a long time. Our users are already logging in with smartcard but we are looking for something a little more modern. \n With smartcard login already established we have all of the PKI, DC, and other pre-reqs in place for the key trust method. It seems like enabling this would be as simple as adding the Azure AD user to the Key admins group, and enabling the GPO on a few test accounts. \n Reading through the docs i see MS is now heavily pushing the cloud trust method over the key trust. The big driver is simplicity without the needs for all the PKI and other setup. \n Sometimes what MS pushes is whats best for them and not for the customer. So what are your thoughts with the existing PKI in place if you were doing a new WHfB setup would you go key trust or cloud trust. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/teeawayfour  \n [link]   [comments]",

The keyvault did not have the soft delete feature as it was an \"old\" one, the feature was not enabled by default back then.\n Now the database is completely impossible to recover as the backup are also encrypted. We effectively have lost 4 years worth of data give or take.\n I don't know what will happen to me yet, I know that my boss is pissed off, the CTO is pissed off, and I am pissed off at myself lol.\n How do you cope with those kind of situations ?\n Details : \n Just giving some context as to why I deleted the fucking keyvault. It had a funny name (not standard at all), with only one key, the key had the name of a server that was deleted since 2020. Turns out the DBA used the same key to encrypt the server that replaced it. \n As I was trying to clean up our Azure subscriptions, because we have tons of unused resources, I thought this one was safe to delete.\n I immediediatly enabled both soft delete and purge protection for all our keyvaults after this mistake.\n    submitted by    /u/HeavenlyRen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I hope this helps someone, we have been running down this very very frustrating path for awhile now. At first I did not believe it was isolated to the new machines our support team was deploying (Latitude 3310) but we have confirmed that to be the case.\n Issue: Users were reporting that during the day Outlook would become disconnected and refuse to re-establish connectivity without rebooting the device. Teams would also have similar issues. A reboot \"fixed\" it for a couple hours. In the AAD logs token refreshes were failing with server/proxy couldn't be found, so I was tracking that down believing it to be related.\n Resolution: I was in the office for the first time in awhile and went to one of our employees reporting this issue as well. I noticed his CPU fan was running non stop, and that really irritates me, so I found the service consuming it which ended up being part of the Dell Optimizer suite. This is \"Intelligent AI-based features automatically fine-tune your PC for the best possible connection, audio and performance.\" NOPE, it sure isn't.\n Dell has a feature called \"Express Connect\" which seems to try and do some QoS style shaping but in real world simply causes nothing but issues. After uninstalling Dell Optimizer and its service (you need to do both) these issues have disappeared.\n TL;DR: Dell Optimizer does nothing to optimize and in fact causes issues that you'll be pulling your hair out on for awhile. Uninstall it and its service.\n ​\n Edit: After KNOWING the issue was Dell Optimizer I am able to locate countless reddit posts about the issue. I almost feel like we need some sort of KB of known trash. We don't reimage these because they are Intune/Autopilot machines going to random sites. \n    submitted by    /u/ydidipickthisdumname  \n [link]   [comments]",

I write them infrequent enough to not be able to visualise a few jobs at a time in my head.\n CronTool has been built together with the Reddit r/programmer community and it got a few novel features that (to my knowledge) you can't find anywhere else. To start, there's a view that allows you to visualise multiple cron jobs - or if you wish: your entire crontab file on a calendar!\n Many of the common crons need 2 or more cron jobs defined, for example:\n Run a cron at two different set times. e.g. I want a cron to run twice daily, at 8:30am and 11:30pm:\n 30 8 * * * 30 23 * * * \n (link)\n Run a cron every 15 minutes throughout the day except at 3AM:\n */15 0-2,4-23 * * * 15-45/15 3 * * * \n (link)\n There is finally a good way to have an overview other those and I hope you'll find this useful too.\n Compared to existing online cron job editor, there are a few things this one can do:\n  \n✅ (obviously) calendar view\n ✅ support for L, W & LW values\n ✅ optional support for seconds & years\n ✅ support for the ? value\n ✅ support for the # value\n ✅ more help & documentation for first timers. Q/A with examples that need multiple crons, for example this one\n ✅ support for debugging multiple crons at once (see above)\n  \nThanks for reading!\n    submitted by    /u/mindrudan  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have hybrid azure with on-prem ad, laptops are not yet Intune enrolled but are azure ad joined. Windows hello tested and it works. Also company don't want to \"force\" user to use personnal phone (app/number) so we plan to use TAP when users don't want to.\n We planned to help user enable windows hello using TAP/sms/app. Conditional access wil not ask for MFA when on premise (by ip) so it would be only when accessing cloud apps from home.\n But when i test it with windows hello enabled, when challenged for mfa, i can't chose windows hello as a method, Microsoft asks for me to register a MFA method (and redirect me to only authenticator app which annoys me since users can't chose SMS if they want)\n Any idea or best practice on how to achieve that ?

          "description": "I had my first real life encounter with the 2038 bug this week. The situation was caused by a program we have that queries a domain registration API based on expiration date ranges. I had set it to query up to 15 years in the future (even though I know domains can only be registered up to 10 years in the future ... I wrote this thing 20 years ago so I don't remember why I added the extra 5).\n Anyway, 15 years from Jan 23, 2023 (calculated naively as 15 * 365) is Jan 19, 2038. So starting yesterday my query was breaking the API (internal error). The owners of the API identified the problem pretty quickly and confirmed it's the 2038 problem. I changed to query only 10 years in the future and they've now got 5 years to fix it\n I suspect we'll start seeing more of these random discoveries every January, with spikes in 2028 and 2033. Hopefully I'm right in thinking most of the problem code will just get naturally replaced in the next 15 years, but I know I've got a couple of old databases in production that will have to be fixed before then.\n    submitted by    /u/abqcheeks  \n [link]   [comments]",

But no I ended up locking them out.\n In my attempt to recover their files I realized that the BitLockercker key was never stored in Azure or their Microsoft \"My Account\" Page. \n That's when it settled in that I really fucked up.\n My only option was to nuke their computer and hope they had backed up everything to Google Drive or OneDrive. But low and behold they didn't. It's company policy for them to store all their files in google drive and not store any files locally. Still I feel that I really fucked up and I spent 6 hours trying to recover their files and ended up nuking their machine.\n But lesson learned. Don't run dangerous commands on a users machine, and make sure all their files are saved in the cloud if I do have to run dangerous commands.\n I really hope I don't get fired. But I am submitting an Incident report tomorrow morning to the CEO, Co-Founder, and VP (users boss). Let's hope I don't get fucked too bad.

Both computers have a crossover cable connecting them with static IP addresses set, so offline and airgapped.\n The customer reached out to me because their HP LaserJet 1160 was having problems and they couldn't get anyone to work on it. They wanted a printer to replace it with, but wanted one with an LPT port. Long story short, I couldn't find any of those handy, but was able to get things working with a USB printer. Enter the Brother HL-L2300D. A USB-only printer that still has Windows XP drivers listed on Brother's website.\n Plug that guy in, install the drivers, share it, and then run\n  \nnet use lpt2: \"\\hostname\\BrotherP\" /persistent:yes\n  \nThen I went into the DOS program and pointed print jobs to LPT2 instead of LPT1. Had to change the print processor from RAW to TEXT to get it printing, but print it did!\n It's not every day I get to work on something this old, and normally I just say \"nah\" to unsupported stuff like this.

Two Windows 2012r2 servers are connected to it forming a failover cluster for a file server role. This has been fine for years, but now the role fails to bring the volume online due to a 'thread exit or application request'. I believe this is actually timing out:\n Having removed the disk from the cluster entirely, if I try to bring it online on one of the hosts directly, it takes a long time - 30 minutes+ while disk management is locked up. But you can see constant data being read on the iscsi interfaces before it randomly mounts. The data continues to be read but at this point you can browse the data etc. It's like it's scanning the entire content of the volume. \n I can't figure out why this has started happening - it's the same on both hosts, plus another unrelated server I've mounted it on. I guess the issue is the volume, but once it's mounted everything seems okay with the data, and other volumes on other servers from the same MS3600i are cracking on with life. \n Any ideas appreciated - I am perplexed.\n    submitted by    /u/NickTheSloth  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm using a third party BT Stick that works for all other peripherals I connect perfectly fine and did so for the mouse too - just to clarify it shouldnt be the stick imo. \n ​\n The issue is the following: \n ​\n Sometimes (I cant reproduce) the cursor freezes and I cant use the mouse anymore. Mouse is fully charged. To get the cursor moving again I need to either open - if it isnt already - the Bluetooth settings of Windows or if it is already open close it. This seems to reset a driver or wake a suspended driver or device. All movement and clicks the physical mouse performed while it wasnt working in Windows will then be carried out as if queued for later execution. \n ​\n I cant find an option to disable energy saving and this just started a few weeks ago. Unfortunately I do not recall if it started after an update.\n ​\n ​\n Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/Hoppse88  \n [link]   [comments]",

When authenticating to this target, Kerberos will use the DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes registry value on the authenticating DC to determinte supported etypes. If the registry value is not configured, the default value is 0x27, which means 'use AES for session keys and RC4 for ticket encryption' - If this target server does not support AES, you must set msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes to 4 on this object so that only RC4 is used. (Please consider working with your vendor to upgrade or configure this server to support AES. Using RC4 is not recommended) - If this target server does not support RC4, or you have disabled RC4 on DCs, please set DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes on DCs to 0x18 or msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes on this object to 0x18 to specify that AES must be used.

          "description": "Hey everyone, \n i just wanted to know what are the best practices for setting up a windows 10 image or .wim file and deploying that as efficient as possible for a small business of 25 users and little ressources. Im just asking because I'm curious if there are other better ways. I came from a company which had 3000 Users and we used Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager for creating images and deploying them to specific PCs over ethernet.\n Right now at my new company this is not an option as it would be completely overkill for a small business and cost way too much. What I did instead is set up a virtual machine with windows 10 on my local computer, configure some local policies, install some software and create an image which I then deploy by using usb-sticks and using sample scripts from microsoft for formatting and applying the image. But is this really the best method? What I have to do for every PC after applying the image is updating everything, doing a domain or adding missing drivers which drives me nuts sometimes because sometimes the PC has network problems because of missing drivers, which I then have to add manually. \n What I liked about Endpoint Configuration Manager was that you could automate all of these things. Drivers could be added to the task sequence and where loaded from a specific server which the PC connected to while applying the task sequence. Domain join and updates etc. where also all done while applying task sequence. What was left to do for the admin was just to check if everything worked after the PC finished and most of the time, it worked. Is there any similar, cheaper technology or method which can reach the same level of automation?\n    submitted by    /u/Comfortable_Onion318  \n [link]   [comments]",

On further investigation we found that the route reflectors were not advertising the VPLS AD prefixes as the Cisco devices were never sending a RT-constraint NLRI for configured VFIs using BGP autodisover but LDP signalling.

          "description": "Anyone had any luck trying to use Clearpass for returning DPSKs to a Ruckus controller?\n It's one of those things that would be relatively easy on a more open platform, but looks impossible on a locked-down appliance like Clearpass.\n Clearpass certainly supports the MAC auth that the Ruckus uses in External DPSK mode. And it has no problem in returning Ruckus VSA 142 that should contain a modified version of each PSK. The problem is in storing the PSKs.\n As per the Ruckus docoumentation for the DPSK format, Clearpass would have to be able to use one of the SHA1 key derivation functions and then store a byte array based on a combination of the SSID and the PSK. Let's assume the PSK is admin-assigned, not generated for each client by Clearpass. The natural place to store a DPSK would be a custom dictionary attribute in the Endpoints repository, however, these do not support byte arrays, nor do they provide any access to basic functions. In this case the required function is definitely available to the underlying system as Clearpass uses it for hashing admin user passwords. In any case since the DPSK format is zero-padded a string field cannot be used instead.\n Anyway, I figured it worth asking if anyone had found a solution.\n    submitted by    /u/perryurban  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of which is coming up due no longer being able to get support or licences for the Watchguard M200.\n We are having to look at upgrading possibly part of this setup or all of it as part of a refresh due to this and preventative in case of failure of the hardware since its over 6 years old. (before my time). We have no choice but to upgrade the Watchguard m200 since the licensing which we just renewed Jan 2023 (paid for one year) but only can get it till end of June this year.\n We have been quoted by the company which we outsource some of this the Meraki kit from cisco. \n The MX105 to replace the router/firewall which is currently a Watchguard M200.\n MS120-48FP in place of the two HPE switches and \n MR44 to replace the ubiquity wifi access points.\n ​\n However from the research I have done, it feels quite overkill. We have about 40-50 employees in the office and 100 others working on phones remotely (which don't need to really connect to the office network). Only users which need to VPN access to the office network is about 10-20 users.\n ​\n I'm Torn between the two options (open to other options), \n  \nReplace only the Watchguard M200 with the latest equivalent and upgrade the controller for the AP's to a more reliable one. \n Follow the recommendation but possibly with a MX75 instead of a MX105.\n  \nOne thing that does confuse me is whether some of the security features are tied to licences (advanced security, enterprise or SD-WAN) or to the devices. Features such as content filtering and web search filtering and intrusion protection. \n What they quoted us came to about £27,000 for kit and licences for 3 years. I'm quite new to this could use some advice\n    submitted by    /u/OZA_IT  \n [link]   [comments]",

The client settings and WLAN are exactly like the interop report. Doing wireshark traces does not reveal the problem. Did several Ascom log traces and when I caught the problem, notify Ascom and apparenly we do not have some super duper special docking station which allows me to view the log file. Absolutely livid about that. Getting no real help from Ascom other than they want more Omnipeek traces. \n I have been concentrating on one zone at a time.

Currently it is set up with RSTP, the MC-LAG interfaces are set to point to point and other interfaces are edge, the ICL between the stack has RSTP disabled, and it's set block BPDU on edge.\n The Cisco portion of the network has Rapid-PVST+, the core is the root bridge, the others are default, access ports are portfast, etc. basic Cisco set up really.\n I am not sure if I should disable all STP on the MC-LAG interfaces to the core and management switch, the MC-LAG stack is an aggregate switch stack, should it just pass through the BPDU packets? I believe this is what the Juniper documentation is getting at but it's a little wishy washy on that. This would basically leave Cisco to run STP on its network, and just leave the rack alone. Or do I pass through the packets and enable Rapid-PVST+ on the management switch, on the other side of the Juniper MC-LAG?\n Or should I also be setting up the Juniper MC-LAG stack to be handling the incoming BPDU packets from the Cisco? I would have to add PVST to it as well for interoperability, I am just not sure how this may affect the RSTP running locally, which was recommended to be enabled by Junipers docs.\n Any help would be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/misterezekiel  \n [link]   [comments]",

These devices essentially all rely on multicasting, IGMP, and are in the realm of 10Gb to 25Gb per device/host. One issue that i've seen frequently in some courses panels in regards to switch stacking, is that by stacking switches you can quickly run into severe multicast flooding. Arista deals with this through what they call \"Multi-cast Orchestration\" on their own switches, and Netgear acknowledges it's an issue and says \"Care should be taken\" when stacking switches- however I haven't heard anyone mention how to actually prevent or stop that multicast flooding on a network without something like Arista's proprietary product. Is there a common approach to handling this I'm not aware of or some 3rd party product which can handle this? What is the \"care\" you would even take to prevent that form of multicast flooding? \n The reason for the stacked switches is to achieve 100% redundancy, allow easier expandability, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/Not-Satan-But-Close  \n [link]   [comments]",

Palo is scheduled this week to discuss why they are the best.\n our IT security team is pushing Checkpoint hard. Their basis is it’s the most secure and point to 2 things. Testing showing that they block way more attacks than all the others and a claim that there are no CVEs in the last 8 years. The first item I’m disregarding because it’s a checkpoint sponsored test comparing Physical Hardware to VMs. \n However the second claim has me intrigued.

About 40% to 50% google and another 40-50% facebook. Ive recently got my network its own ASN and public ipv4 ipv6. \n Right now I have sent a request to google about it. Im just curious to know since on their website, it doesnt show any other requirements aside from having to have asn and ipv4 in RIR directory. \n Does google require certain TRAFFIC to be able to qualify for GGC?\n THANKS!\n    submitted by    /u/gstheft  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have decided to take a job working for a federal contractor due to the pay increase and benefits for my family. \n The job that I ended up taking is pretty much help desk stuff at a healthcare facility. \n The trouble I think about is whether I made a choice that puts me back a few steps or if I've made a good choice. \n Background:\n My current job as a net admin is pretty wtf imo. It was all good at first with my previous boss. Like I stayed within the confines of my JD but he left and now instead of being the net admin to all 3 separate departments, I'm stuck messing around trying to help 1. \n Firstly, my boss doesn't know anything about Wi-Fi, networking and network devices. He does know voice stuff I guess? (supposedly. He basically relies on support to give him all the answers and then says it like he knew all along). \n Secondly, I am technically supposed to resolve networking issues for the IT department as a whole, clients and most installs as well as build networks for projects but I'm too busy trying to run around and be the manager my boss isn't for 1 group that I wasn't even supposed to pay this much attention to. \n Thirdly, I am honestly running around trying to be a dude in construction and find ways to get an install done for clients without having the company spend on contractors to do that work professionally. It's the weirdest thing ever. \n Lastly, My JD explicitly stated I'm only supposed to be resolving network issues and build our large projects and when I bring this up I get the \"I know. Thank you. You're really doing amazing.\" \n There's more to the story but I'm really trying to not rattle on.\n    submitted by    /u/ClowNSoundZ  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Atoms almost always fail and require a power cycle or a complete factory reset before the update can succeed. The AP250s exhibit the same behavior, but not as often. Sometimes I do have to deactivate PoE on their backhaul ports to get them to eventually behave.\n Every AP is backhauled btw, no mesh. \n To troubleshoot, I've consoled into a couple while this process happens, but the logs I see give no clear indication of why updates could have failed besides some vague messages about losing connectivity to the cloud.. but they're rebooting and won't have connectivity to anything. The cloud console gives no information whatsoever after a failure. In the device list, the ones that eventually fail get stuck at 12% on the progress bar... for HOURS.\n These are all legacy Aerohive devices by the way. We had these before AH was acquired by Extreme. Are we running into some kind of planned deprecation situation? The thing that bothers me is even when we were running Aerohive's Mangler, this stuff still happened, but not as bad and way less frequent.\n Is extreme/aerohive's cloud management just this bad? Or is there something wrong with how these are deployed/operating? These things are workhorses. And after tuning the hell out of the system due to a high-density/high-interference environment, users have been happy.

Now they decided to buy the property across the street and covert it to another 5 rooms for the hotel. They want internet and IP cameras across the street.

Theres no vegetation in the line of sight, but it rains a lot. Currently I use a Huwei LTE modem/router with 3 Unifi AP's. I think I am going to add a load balancing router so I can use two ISPs for more consistency and speed. \n The owner said we could bury a conduit if we want. Also I could hypothetically use the utility poles to span cable (is that a good idea)? I want something thats going to work 99% of the time. I don't live down there so if theres a problem, I have to call and walk someone (usually with very little IT experience) through how to reset a device or trouble shoot.

During the interview we had to complete a skills test that was set up in a collapsed core configuration:\n Cisco catalyst 9500 as the core/distribution switch and a Cisco Catalyst 9300 as the access. One of the Objectives was to set up an etherchannel link between the distribution and access layer switches and using port channel 1 as the container. The directions were vague so I assumed they'd leave it up to the interviewee to choose PAgP or LACP so i opted to set each side to channel group mode on. When I tried to apply the configuration both the 9500 and 9300 spit out \"command rejected\" I forget the exact verbage. In the end, I ended setting the distribution switch to channel group mode active and the access switch to passive and the etherchannel relationship formed. My I'm just scratching my head as to why mode on was rejected.\n EDIT: fixed some grammar and verbage\n    submitted by    /u/Mechin17  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey Ya'll,\n I'm deploying DOT1X EAP-TLS port authentication with a fallback guest VLAN on Cisco Catalyst C3850 switches used for access to offices and shared workspaces. I've followed the Cisco guides and have the proof of concept system working.... mostly. I am running into an issue with DHCP after assignment to the guest VLAN. When authentication fails or times out the port is assigned to the guest VLAN. However the Windows DHCP service times out and self assigns an AIPA address before the DOT1X authentication failure/timeout occurs. The Windows machine will then sit on the Guest VLAN without an IP address for approximately 5 minutes before the Windows DHCP service reattempts a DHCP request and is successful.\n The reason I'm asking this here, is that I would like to adjust my switch configs to account for this since theoretically devices getting assigned to the guest VLAN won't be under my control to adjust Windows DHCP settings.\n Is there a best practice or recommended DOT1X auth timeout?\n The proof of concept is using this setup on the ports:\n interface GigabitEthernet1/0/X\n switchport mode access\n device-tracking attach-policy dot1x\n authentication event fail action authorize vlan 5\n authentication event no-response action authorize vlan 5\n authentication open\n authentication port-control auto\n authentication timer reauthenticate 180\n authentication violation replace\n dot1x pae authenticator\n dot1x timeout start-period 5\n dot1x timeout held-period 1\n dot1x timeout auth-period 18\n    submitted by    /u/mixinitup4christ  \n [link]   [comments]",

We maintain an alias in our firewall for customer IP addresses\n \nBackup files are encrypted with a 2048bit key as they are generated at the customer site. They cannot be read without this key\n \nThe connection itself is TLS from the customer server to the backup appliance\n \nThe backup client at the customer sites must have a seperate 2048bit key in order to connect and have Read/Write access to the backup appliance\n \nThe backup appliance is off domain and uses a separate set of credentials from anything else\n \n  \nHere is the debate.\n A coworker is pretty insistent that we should be running these connections over a VPN of some sort. Either OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IPSec maybe. I have countered that since the backups themselves are encrypted AND are being sent over TLS, this is not necessary and would harm performance.\n What do you think?

Nothing new is in production yet, we're still in the planning phase, and we're trying to figure out how difficult this will be (we're in a manufacturing environment where some sites work 3 shifts and almost never shut down).\n According to this compatibility matrix, it should work. Here's a screenshot of the relevant section.\n I've got one of the 9800s online and I've got a spare 2702 AP that I'm testing with.

          "description": "Hi,\n Not sure if this exists yet, but can we create an International BGP community standard or something along those lines for advertising your prefixes so we know what Country/State/Province/Region/etc your prefixes are located?\n We operate a latency sensitive network and have to constantly filter certain prefixes from being learnt via certain AS' so they have optimal routing and it is a tedious task. \n This is where I had the idea that surely there had to be a better way and the first thing that came to my head is BGP communities that will identify the Country/State/Province/Region/etc. For example, an ASN with the 123.123.123.0/24 prefix in Japan Hokkaido Region can have a BGP community of 11:1 announced with their prefix. 11 being the Country (Japan) and 1 being the Hokkaido Region. (Side note: I really hope we end up giving Japan 11 as their BGP community code as a *tips fedora* to Code Geass).\n I'll admit this is not fully thought through yet and I wanted to open up the discussion to the networking community to hear their thoughts. The first issue I can forsee is AS' that strip BGP communities. In my head this International BGP community standard would be most useful in IXs.\n TLDR; If you operate an ASN can you advertise your prefixes with a BGP community that will identify the Country:/State/Province/Region/etc?

The remote site is on a cable internet circuit. At all my sites, including the remote site, 802.1X with EAP-TLS is used for both wireless and wired auth. This has been working great for months, until my ISP changed which backbone on their network my DIA connection runs across. No other changes were made anywhere other than the provider's backbone that's delivering the DIA circuit.\n The IP address of the SRX in the DC didn't change and the tunnel is still up and working. I can't find any evidence of issues with the tunnel, except .1X doesn't work anymore. On the NPS servers in the DC, event viewer shows that auth requests are coming in from the switch and AP at the remote site, but it almost seems like the .1X requests are getting mangled across the site-to-site tunnel. The same NPS servers service .1X for hardwired and wireless clients across several other sites connected via the ISP's MPLS without issue.\n Event viewer shows that auth requests from the AP at the remote site get logged as event id 6274 \"The RADIUS Request message that Network Policy Server received from the network access server was malformed.\" Auth requests from hardwired ports from the remote switch show that rather than the computer name with a certificate, the request shows the client trying to auth with its mac address as the username and PAP and summarily denied.\n A tech at the ISP that made the backbone change and I have been beating our heads against the wall for a few days now with no progress. I've resorted to installing wireshark on the NPS server to try to find differences between known-good auth packets and broken packets, but haven't found an obvious difference yet.

Some sites even have various other types of encryption. From my understanding, typically the site rtr does NOT have MPLS config, though we still have MPLS qos config on each site rtr, along with the hub having MPLS qos config. Our hub feeds into another MPLS network we own - after collectors - so I’d presume, if the marking is kept, that it could be used for our campus MPLS qos (I think that’s the teams thought here). However, peeling back the onion, it was revealed to me by AT&T, that each site doesnt necessarily have a COS profile ordered with them , which would explain some of the asymmetrical issues seen while traffic went through AVPN - maybe. My question is, if we are hopping around at layer 3 already, would MPLS markings still be seen or matter by AT&Ts underlay somewhere? Even with just the basic GRE traffic, I’d figure that qos markings would be copied over maintained? Right now, I think the profile not being set as being the problem / waste.\n At a higher level to this, it seems like there’s a possibility that whoever architected the design so that we control L3, traded off the QoS perk gained from MPLS.

But. \n I have engagement (tehe) with a vendor on a project recently. They provide SaaS for my company. We are trying to stand up a new site to site. Problem is we don't see the tunnel (policy based) come up. My next steps were to do an embedded pcap as I am not seeing any traffic from the host at the firewall. I send an email to the vendor saying I see no traffic each time we test... but then after I explicitly point at the host in one of my emails we see an icmp request come across the fw about an hour later. Following I get an email from their pm asking me to explain steps I see in the network and they are requesting an additional resource to look at our network. \n Now the question. And don't get me wrong, this is indeed ego related, but my ego isnt that big (is it?). \n Previously when setting up the site to site, I worked with a respectable sounding network engineer. Would it be wrong to reach out to him and ask him what the hell? (Respectfully.) The problem is that the traffic never leaves the host. We have routes out and they proved it via ping. \n TLDR: I want to hear about times that you all took back alleys to get things accomplished.

Every day around the same time, one of our sites' (public high school) bandwidth drops to nothing for about 15 minutes. I ran iperf tests on repeat and logged the output across the WAN to the site and I was getting around 1.8Gbits/s on a 2Gbits/s connection. Right around the time the students leave the bandwidth tanked in iperf (just across the WAN to the DC) and on speedtest.net to 30Mbits/s for between 5 and 15 minutes. Seems to happen each day around that time and then just clears up.\n I have smokeping running and that looks clean and never shows a change. I don't drop regular ping packets but if I run a faster fping I do see between 1%-4% packet loss around that time. Interfaces on my router are clear. Nothing in the logs of the routers on either side. Something tells me it's the WAN provider but I am out of ideas on what to test or how to prove the issue further. I plan on reaching out to them tomorrow to see if they can seen anything on their side but I know that will be tough to get them to research it.

          "description": "Hi all,\n I'm in the process of replacing the firewalls at our main site as well as our DR site and had a question as to what the best way to setup SSL VPN connections for our users would be. The current setup is non-existent in that my predecessor never did any SSL VPN config on the DR firewall (I don't know how they thought that was going to work in a disaster).\n Each site is going to have a pair of Palo Alto 3410s in active/passive HA. I'd like to try to avoid having to setup each user with 2 different SSL VPN configs (one for normal use and one for DR use) and the only way of doing this that comes to mind immediately would be for me to have a virtual firewall in the cloud that I use to terminate all of the client SSL VPN connections to and then have a site to site VPN between that firewall and both the production site and the DR site. With that setup, in a DR scenario I wouldn't have to touch the SSL VPN config, just route the traffic from the virtual firewall to the DR site rather than the main site. Obviously this would require extra licensing for the virtual firewall and increases complexity but I'm thinking it might be worth it to not have to setup every user with multiple SSL VPN configs and explain to them to use the DR one in a DR scenario.\n I don't have much experience with SSL VPN configs on Palo Alto firewalls yet, so if there is an easier or more efficient way to achieve this please feel free to suggest.

Ideally it lets us also choose whatever carrier has best signal instead of being locked to the carrier we bought the sim from.\n I was looking at Twiliio, and the platform is just super cool, but we're not large enough for them to be interested in giving us a better rate.

I have the above Nexus layer 3 switch with a 1G ethernet transceiver and a CATx cable around 20m length plugged to an HP laptop also with an onboard ethernet port, auto-speed/duplex at both ends. The problem is that despite both ends being logically active, the link reports as not connected, when both ends are then physically connected. Bring down and bring back up the port on the Laptop (Windows Networking disable/enable) everything springs into life. Same symptoms observed plugging into another network device, although in that case, no option exists to manually down/up the interface (cheap IP cam) Plug the same devices and the cable into another switch, different brand but same logical configuration - it all comes up first time.

The idea is to provide free wifi to roughly 60-100 sites (read homes) that will be equipped with a low-cost router enabling several family members to connect to.\n There's been some back and forth on what equipment to use, but I was hoping that there was a best-practices standard that we could fall back on. Reliability, affordability, and ease of maintenance are the three top priorities (in that order) for this project. It will be really hard to service the APs and routers hooked up to the local fiber network that will be provided by a telco.\n The idea is to set up \"smart\" poles that will be used to mount the APs as well as all of the grounding equipment etc.\n Thanks again for any and all advice -- we will most likely need to contract this out but I wanted to check with this sub first just to get a general idea of min/max including projected costs.\n    submitted by    /u/sksksjhdjajss  \n [link]   [comments]",

The current method of listening to these devices is to connect them all to a large hub and listen on whichever computer I’m using to record the data. Processing is done as data arrives, etc. This is manageable, but undesirable for a couple reasons:\n  \nOnly one PC can listen at a time\n \nTo reduce bandwidth cost, the devices do not report human-readable data. Rather, the host is responsible for deserializing/parsing the data as it’s streamed though\n \n Solution: Have a single server computer dedicated to listening to the serial streams, parsing, then passing the stream to clients around the network in a more desirable format. Extending this, I suppose there could be multiple “sub” servers forwarding to a main server which distributes to whoever is listening, but I’m not going to bother with that at the moment. \n My question(s) to you: \n  \nIs this worth pursuing? At its core, all I’m doing is forwarding usb bits to the network and moving the parsing work to a different computer. At the moment, a single computer solution is working just fine, if annoying. \n \nHas anyone done anything like this? \n \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/SquiDoge  \n [link]   [comments]",

Shaw called me last month and said our router is pulling too many IPs (~500) when we are only assigned 5. Nothing has changed in our configuration that would have caused this - I have literally not touched this client's network in over a year.\n So, checking their settings from the ISP, looks like:\n WAN IP: 1.2.3.200\n Subnet: 255.255.254.0\n Gateway: 1.2.3.1\n We are assigned the static IPs .200-.204\n Right off the bat, I'm thinking - there are your 500 IPs, its just getting everything on the subnet they gave me. Due to the gateway address, I can't make it smaller than 255.255.255.0. When I make that change, guess what? Now there's only 200-something IPs being pulled. They swear the original settings are correct.\n When I look in the SonicWall logs, I see lots of \"failed TCP packets\" from some China IP with a destination of another IP on the subnet that is not in our block of static IPs (lets say it is 1.2.3.50). Is there something configured in the SonicWall that is doing this?\n I told Shaw that their equipment should be restricting the IPs to whatever they give us, and its not my fault/problem. They came and replaced their modem today and it still has the same problem - pulling way too many IPs. Their next step is they want me to factory reset the SonicWall and set it up from scratch - no way am I doing that!\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/RainyNetAdmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm in the process of evaluating some access layer switch replacements for the SMB I work at. Here is what I'm having a hard time deciding: \n I am looking at either Cisco C1000 or Aruba CX6000 48 and 24 port PoE switches. Supply chain is like everything else right now and lackluster at best. They are also getting pretty expensive. \n I can find \"previously loved\"/refurb Aruba 2530 or Cisco 3750X 48 and 24 port PoE switches that support our requirements for about 1/5 to 1/3 of the cost from a reputable supplier. Cisco 3750X is out of support and the 2530 will be soon, so no critical vulnerability patches when/if they happen. \n Our perimeter will be secured with either Fortigate or Palo Alto and proper segmented network design, and these switches will sit only on the access layer. \n What I'm struggling with is justifying the HUGE jump in price to go brand new. Yes, I realize it could prevent a potential failure, but these are also Cisco and Aruba switches that will most likely last 10-15 years without issue which has been my experience with both brands. If one fails, I can stock 3 in its place and still come out ahead. \n Curious what the consensus is on missing out on vulnerability patches on switches that are at the access layer? Judging from other threads it's a mixed bag, but thought I'd see what kind of discussion comes up! \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/aarondavis87  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm self-taught in SQL and Server admin, and the guy that had previously setup the network I'm working on is out on medical leave (not expected back before go-live). \n We're a small company, that recently decided to open a second location several states away from our current. Our current network is a 10.10.x/23 setup, with 1-79 reserved for static devices (servers, switches, printers, network connected manufacturing devices), and the rest as DHCP for internal and guest networks. We're very close to our 512 address limit. Our new location is expected to roughly need 20 more static addresses, and peak around 100 DHCP between internal and guest. My initial thought was to use the same DHCP host, expand the subnet to a 10.10.x/21, block of a larger range for statics, and expand DHCP range for the rest. \n However, I get the impression that I can create the 2nd location network as it's own 10.10.x/24 range, and use DHCP Relay to enable communication without having to rework all of the local stuff. That should just require some changes to the initial DHCP, and DNS, but otherwise will all be configurable on the Firewall at location2?\n ​\n So in things needing adjusted in Loc1 (ex. 10.10.100/23)\n -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)\n -DHCP Host\n -DNS Host\n -rest of the network is no-change\n Loc2 (ex 10.10.200/23)\n -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)\n -rest of the network is nothing extra to setup\n ​\n Is this best practice?

This endpoint is restricted in the firewall to a known Allowlist of customer FQDN and IP addresses. \n Orders from a particular customer stopped flowing this week. We reached out to the customer Tech Support for assistance, no response. After a backlog of about $200,000 worth of purchase orders had stacked up, I dug in.\n I knew that the customer's app was trying to make a connection and assumed they were hitting us from an unknown and disallowed IP address. Using Packet Capture and wireshark, I was able to sift though all of the Scans, bots, and other nasty traffic and ended up correlating inbound dropped packets to outbound confirmation requests (from other TCP streams initiated by us). The source and destination IPs were different, but both in Google Cloud.\n I took an educated guess and whitelisted an unknown IP Address and the orders started flowing again.\n Turns out the customer had migrated their services to Google Cloud and had not informed their downstream vendors of the change. \n I love this detective work, using wireshark to solve these kinds of mysteries and investigating what is otherwise \"invisible\".\n I'm a generalist - a mile wide and an inch deep but have recently developed a strong desire to specialize in networking or Cyber.

Before performing the upgrade we forgot to disable the NAT rules on the Fortigate which were running parallel with Palo Alto firewalls. \n During the upgrade firewalls failed over and the ARP table on our ISP gateway got updated with new ARP entries from Fortigate (GARP sent during HA failover). And users lost access to some of the servers NAT'ed on outside. Since we don't have access to the ISP gateway to clear ARP cache, we needed to contact the ISP support, unfortunately no one responded in a timely manner.\n So the situation is that we need to wait till the arp timer expires in the ISP gateway and we don't know how long it takes and we cannot afford a long outage. So we had to fix this issue asap without performing a failover or any changes in Palo Alto to trigger GARP. \n Then we found this command  test arp gratuitous ip <ip/netmask> interface <interface name>  which would manually trigger a GARP and it saved our day. It updated the upstream ISP gateway ARP tables. I know that we could do this in Cisco ASA and Firepower but wasn't aware that this is available in Palo.

The state changed to connected, and still no traffic getting through.\n The trunk that was working was 10G MMF fiber. I could still see the other switch via CDP, but no traffic getting through. I changed the SFP+ on both ends, and I was able to ping the other switch, but it was really bad. When I sent 100 pings to the other switch, it would timeout at random intervals. 80/100 success rate. The trunk link is at 10G full-duplex on both ends. \n I tried 1G SFP, and still no dice. The 1G SFP MMF states were down down. So I went back to SFP+.\n I swapped the fiber from orange to aqua, and it was worse. With aqua fiber, there is no traffic at all, but CDP is working. I changed ports and still no traffic. I swapped to copper, and the same - CDP is working, but no traffic getting through. \n The config on each port is the same. Upstream Switch (i think it is a 3850):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 nonegotiation  Downstream Switch (I think it is a 3750):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 Switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q nonegotiation  This whole time the 3850 led was green, but the 3750 was amber.

Our solar network needs to communicate to 192.168.0.100 to get data from their existing electrical infrastructure. Their 192.168.0.100 is not connected to the internet due to security reasons, it's literally got an unmnaged switch with no router even, we are allowed though to connect onto that network as long as their computer doesn't have any internet access. Secondly, we've got a TV in the entrance of the building displaying data from the solar for the clients to see, it's almost a 800m run so would rather want to utilise and try to work through their existing network, running a new cable is very hard due to access.\n I please need assistance on how to get traffic from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.5 without interfering with their existing network (not sure if it's called port forwarding?). Client has a network engineer on site but I'm getting the feeling he's not 100% sure how as nothing has been actioned yet, I can hopefully relay info from here to him and see if he finds a way.\n Then I please need assistance on how to get traffic to and from 192.168.0.100 from 192.168.2.2 , is it perhaps port forwarding on the Teltonika and Cisco side? And then setting up a firewall rule on the cisco side to not give internet access to 192.168.2.2?\n I can, going to be hard though, run a seperate cable from the Teltonika straight to the 192.168.0.100 network and then the 192.168.0.100 network is not going to be connected to the Cisco network at all, but then I'll need advise on how to set up on the Teltonika side to not give internet to 192.168.0.100 but still be able to access it.\n Thanks in advance for any assistance!\n    submitted by    /u/Beginning_Brief_534  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example: I've got a batch of PA Firewalls that insist on doing panorama connectivity checks after I change the management IP (a fine idea)... but they start doing these checks before the new IP has actually been applied (a deeply stupid idea) resulting in those checks of course failing and config reverting, even with several retries configured.

The two buildings can currently talk to each other's devices as things stand today. Now I've been asked to move some (but not all) of the equipment from one office to another: VMware Host, NetApp and the ESXI switch stack. I can do basic switch configuration, trunks and vlans and whatnot but networking isn't my strong point. I know enough to hurt myself on the sharp edges. What I'm wondering is: \n If the Core Switch (lets say its 10.1.1.1) is at Building A, if I move the ESXI switch (10.1.1.2) to the other building, is it possible for me to keep it on the 10.1.1.0 network and pass through Building B's core switch with vlans and static routing (Building B is on, say, 10.50.0.0 network) and across the VPN to talk to other 10.1.1.0 resources, or is it going to be easier to re-IP everything I am moving over and let the existing routing handle it? We're trying not to do that because a lot of their network shortcuts the users have are coded to the IPs and not DNS names. Which is silly, yes, I know. \n Looking for advice as to what the \"best\" thing to do would be. And yes, I realize that hiring a networking professional is the Best thing to do, but there is no money in the budget for that. I'm going to have to figure this one out.

I'm assuming as LibreNMS identifies the Juniper as a Juniper but the Adva as a Generic Device this is why I see this difference.\n I have checked the definition and discovery files within Libre and Yaml files do exist for measuring the TX and RX of Adva_FSP150 ports. I took the OIDs being used in this file and set them up as custom OIDs in libre with Gauge selected and dbm as my unit, I do see graphs under customer OIDs but no data being pulled. When I created the customer OIDs I ran a test which said value returned & successful.\n I think my next step will be downloading a MIB browser and checking to ensure the OIDs I have from the YAML file are correct.\n If anyone can point me in the right direction it would be most appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/LamboItalia666  \n [link]   [comments]",

We use this for eBGP and with the routing table nearing 1 million routes we need to either start filtering routes or preferably replacing them with hardware which can cope with much more routes. \n As part of this upgrade we are also looking to increase the transit links from 10Gb links to 100Gb links as well as any uplinks to our core. \n At the moment we have several transits coming in so we want to look at potentially having two transits per router so that's 2 x 100Gb and then we also want dual uplinks for reslience so 4 x 100Gb in total. \n Unfortunately this takes the C8500-12X4QX out of the picture as it won't support 4 x 100Gb links. 2 x 100Gb + 1 40Gb would be fine but not more than 240Gb in enabled links. \n So the next model up would be the C8500-20x6C. This has 6 x 100Gb links which can all be enabled. However the caveat is that this is coming in at £250,000 which includes a £190,000 discount.

We do have other DC's with Juniper but in this case it HAS to be Cisco. \n I'm wondering if I should instead be looking at the ASR9000 range or if the price point of that is also going to be just as ridiculous? \n To give an idea of what Juniper is charging for their MX204 which can handle 4 x 100Gb we were recently quoted £38,000 which includes the perpetual licensing. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Busbyuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Seems like all hell broke loose today. I have a fleet of users with ubuntu linux laptops (ranges from 18.04 - 22.04) that have been on GlobalProtect for a while now. We included 6.0.4.something in our internal repo and installing the GP_UI package is part of our standard ubuntu image. LDAP auth on the backend because Palo/OpenConnect and SAML have been a moving disaster for years...\n Today, a huge uptick in users reporting that GP client is failing a FIPS initialization. No changes to the portal or gateways, and my environment is not FIPS. Windows clients are still fine, only linux users are getting the error as of today.\n The workaround is to remove and re-install the package, and is working for these users. I was wondering if anyone else with Palo Alto GlobalProtect has seen a notable increase in users with FIPS init failure errors.\n I have opened a case with Palo as well as collected user debug logs. But, because linux has never been a priority for Palo, I'm not holding my breath. This will probably turn in to a post about how PaloAlto should drop linux all together, but for now, I'd like to find out WHY? Did Ubuntu depreciate a SSL version that PanGP uses?\n    submitted by    /u/skynet_watches_me_p  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are directly connected\n  \nSome further debugging:\n  \nI can see the Adjacency process begin and the DBD packets transmit \n I can see the VlXX OUT to the PA \n I can see the VlXX IN from the PA \n OUT packet len:1412 \n MTU on the router interface is 1500, verified by ping sweep \n I can see the packets retransmit until they hit 25 where it is killed due to excessive retransmission \n IN packets still come but are ignored for a timer until process repeats\n  \nSo that size 1412 shouldn't get fragmented correct? \n One other thing I noticed is that on the HA Pair, all the Vlan interfaces are setup HSRP, except the one facing the PAs. For whatever reason, those vlan interfaces are setup separate i.e. VlanXX x.x.x.1 and x.x.x.2 with no standby... \n oddly after the Neighbor exchange goes down, I see a new election between the two devices but using other HSRP Vlan interfaces, but over the OSPF VlanXX already in process. This setup seems really odd to me? Could it cause issues?\n It's been a while since I went really deep into OSPF troubleshooting so I'm at a little bit of a loss of where to go next.

The Telonika has two SIM WAN interfaces (one EE, one O2), both interfaces are set to passthrough mode and the UDM Pro is set to DHCP for on it's WAN interface. \n In bridge mode, the Teltonika is no longer accessible (as expected) however, the UDM Pro also does not get the WAN IP address and says that there is no internet connection.\n In passthrough mode the Teltonika is still accessible/ manageable through it's remote management system (as expected), the UDM Pro is adoptable onto the Unifi system and can be remotely managed. However, it's WAN IP address in the Unifi console is a private 192.168.1.x IP address and not the WAN IP the Teltonika has. Laptops connected to the UDM Pro also have no WAN connectivity even though the UDM can get firmware updates and be remotely managed.\n Where am I going wrong? Why does the UDM Pro have some connectivity in pass through mode but absolutely zero in bridge mode? \n Is it CGNAT causing the issue? Is it a NAT or firewall issue on the Teltonika?

They have performed well for us over the years. Now I see that the Cisco Small Business (i.e., Linksys-heritage) line is now no longer being produced, and now it's the \"Cisco Business\" line for SME networking. Looks like the \"Cisco Business 350-24XT Managed Switch\" would be the closest model as compared to what we've bought in the past; I have a few questions...\n 1) Is the NOS closer to Cisco IOS than the CSB line was (that was \"IOS-like\" but had quite a few different commands, etc.) 2) There's no \"DNA\" license BS with this line? 3) Are there other good choices for a 24-port 10GbT switches out there? We have been swinging our switching over to Juniper, but they don't have a good/lower-cost 24-ports of 10GbT model out there from what I can tell... \n (And also, I know 10GbT is kind of a legacy port type vs SFP+, but that's what all their servers have in the location we're buying for, and what the admin staff there knows...)\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/wdennis  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried 2 separate brands using the realtek chipaet, not super impressed with their performance. \n Can you guys suggest one that is reliable and maybe uses USB 3.1 or 3.2?

Apparently, this Small school has to have an internal DNS server to direct them to our website using the internal IP's. This is for all the students and everyone in every subnet. And I asked why they just don't use the public IP if it's accessible. Well, the answer was simple. You cannot access any of the internal websites from the inside using the public IP address. I thought that was strange. \n I did a basic traceroute to the website and yep, it stops on our Palo Alto firewall. It's due to an Age out/incomplete which I'm sure is due to the Virtual router in the firewall not knowing where to send the traffic. \n However, I'm not sure how this should be done. \n Do I just implement a routing rule that anyone coming to the firewall internally asks for the public IP address of our website to redirect them back through the same interface? \n Baically the Default Gateway from the Core Switch has 1 interface connected to the Palo as the next hop that connects that interface to the router, then that router has a next hop for all traffic to our actual router. \n So \n Core Switch 10.0.0.1 -> 10.0.0.2 Palo Alto Vr Router -PublicIP interface. 1 -> Public IP interface Physical Router -> The internet. \n To be clear yes the Firewall has an interface with a public IP address that we own that hops to the router with also a Public IP address that we own and then to the internet.\n    submitted by    /u/jdbrav  \n [link]   [comments]",

The docs I'm reading have you issue the xconnect name with the VFI, and that's also not an option: The only option is the IP of the neigbor. Maybe if I configure the VFI manually and actually get the \"vpn id\" option into the VFI it'll allow me to attach it with xconnect?

There would be an incredible cost saving potential by switching to Fortinet, but one of the security architects (who's a PA fan and is against the change) argues that managing a large rule set on Fortinet would be highly disruptive. He's claiming that companies on Fortinet don't have more than 500 rules to manage. How many rules do you have in your Fortigates, and how do you perceive managing those in comparison to Palo Alto?\n r/pabechan was kind enough to provide the following command with which rules can be counted: show firewall policy | grep -c \"edit\"\n We have…",

This will be my first time doing a configuration like this solo as our engineer is no longer with us, I appreciate any help/advice \n We run a two-tier hierarchy design. We'll have 1 Core switch along with a 5 stack for access switches. This will be for a small(ish) branch location, so not looking to go all out. \n What would be the best way to uplink the access stack to the Core? \n Looking though what our old engineer did, he would use the first two ports on the stack commander to use as uplinks to the Core.\n Would that be the best option, or do we have a point of failure if that stack commander goes down? \n I'm thinking of using 1 port ( or two?) from each switch in the stack to use as an uplink to the Core. Is this silly/over kill? Planning on configuring them all into 1 LAG. ( ex. 1/1/1, 2/1/1, 3/1/1, etc. into LAG ID 1).\n Also, they're looking at getting a 24 port core opposed to a 48. Technically, if I use 1 port on each switch for uplinks I should only need ~16 ports, ~20 if if I go with two per switch. \n Is there something I'm not thinking of that could cause issues down the line? Our current Core's are all 48 ports, though the old admin would use the extra ports as Access, which I do not plan on doing.\n    submitted by    /u/CorrectExcuse2547  \n [link]   [comments]",

Three switches in a stack in one building with our ISP routers, two switches in a stack in our other building. A 10G fiber uplink connects the switch stacks between buildings.\n We have a VOIP Vlan set to Vlan 100. Most user access ports have both the VOIP Vlan and general data VLAN (200) configured. Ex:\n interface GigabitEthernet1/0/3 switchport access vlan 200 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 100 spanning-tree portfast \n Our phones are older Polycom devices, not Cisco.\n I've read up on Cisco Auto QoS, but I've also read it's not the most efficient way of implementing QoS. Especially in an environment that isn't using Cisco phones. I started a support case with Cisco, but they just sent me the Auto QoS documentation I already have...\n Can anyone help me understand what should be done here?

Consider the topology shown in which two hosts A and B are sending packets to D through router R. \n The bottleneck link in the path from R to D runs at 10 MB/s (i.e. 10 Megabytes per second). The RTTs from A to D and B to D are 100 ms. Assume that both A and B can\n communicate with R instantaneously and with arbitrarily large rate. Assume that each packet has a length of 1250 bytes and the buffer on router R can hold 200\n packets.\n Suppose that at time t = 0, host A has a congestion window of 999 packets, B has a congestion window of 0, and R’s buffer is empty. You should assume that packet\n drops are always experienced by the flow with more packets in flight. You should assume that each flow updates its congestion window after each RTT, decreasing it if\n any packet was dropped, and increasing it otherwise.\n AIMD: We first consider the evolution of the system when each flow is governed by AIMD, in which the congestion window grows by being incremented and shrinks by\n being halved (rounding down). In roundtrips 0 through 3, the system evolves as shown in the table below with host A exceeding the given congestion window size and\n accordingly reducing CWND to half in the next iteration. \n Now, suppose that instead we are using an AIAD protocol. In this case, every drop decreases the congestion window by 5 packets (to a minimum of 1 packet) instead\n of halving the congestion window. What is the congestion windows size of host A at t = 300 RTTs? Give your answer in packets. \n The solution states, it should be 300 but I do not understand why and there is nothing else provided.\n ​\n Please help!\n    submitted by    /u/FrainBreez_Tv  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Router is in front so the structure is ISP - Router - DNS - Firewall - Internal Network. \n This external DNS keeps the Host and only Host A files that lets the internet know that website A is IP whatever for the college. \n I believe the DNS servers forward the traffic to Quad9 or something like that, not sure why, but if some one can assist to the reason, I'm sure its a verification method or something to proof that we are the actual college we are advertising or to tell other larger DNS providers know who we are if some one form another state tries to reach our website. \n So on to my question. Is there a better way? I would like to move our records off site to something like cloud flair. However I set up a meeting with them and they said the minimum they covered was for websites that hit 1 million hits per month. Obviously its a community college in a rural area so we get around 17,000 hits. Then they wanted $20,000 a year. \n Now I was trying to keep my cool, but choking inside, so I didn't get a chance to clarify, but I think they thought I wanted some of the premium features and such when really I just wanted to host A records so we had a cloud DNS and if that's just a free thing or if we have to pay a fee. I think it was confusion because the prices on the website did not match up to what they were telling me. \n Can any one clarify if Cloud Flair is free to host records and all I have to do is just verify that we are who we say we are? \n or really any better solution to external DNS hosting or is it fine the way we have it set up?\n    submitted by    /u/jdbrav  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m just worried I’m not going to enjoy what I do once I get out because currently I get to work on a lot of equipment and it’s honestly a lot of fun. I’m also curious if anyone has a role/job somewhat similar to what I do? For instance, at a typical training exercise I get to setup an equipment string supporting about 50-200 users which includes a Satellite Transmissions System or fiber connection and connect it to my router which connects via DMVPN to a NOC and pull services from there. I also get to setup/configure all switches to other offices (tents) to end devices and some encryption equipment and VoIP thrown in there as well. Usually it’s me and 1-2 other people doing all of this and we get a lot of time configuring which I enjoy. So I guess I’m just curious if anyone gets exposed to a lot of different equipment or do you mainly stick to a specific area of configuration?

The challenge we are having is we need to route are usable block of /27 to different WAN /29 address on two firewalls.\n Comcast has given us\n P2P IP:xxx.xxx.xxx.232/29 Gateway (.233) Comcast router Customer Layer 3 (.234)Customer Useable IP’s: xxx.xxx.xxx.235 – xxx.xxx.xxx.238\n and we have Usable EDI Static Range: yyy.yyy.yyy.225-.254 and this is 255.255.255.224 or /27\n I think that Comcast sends our Usable range to the xxx.xxx.xxx.234 address. \n What I have tried is to assign the .234 to a VLAN on our Dell N4000 switch with routing enabled. Then I assigned .235 and .236 to WAN interface on each firewall.\n Our issue comes when trying to setup a route in the table to send yyy.yyy.yyy.226 to the .235 ip. We are going to have to send different usable to the different firewalls. The switch complains that the rout is invalid, which makes sense since its a different network.\n Lots of people suggest getting an EdgeRouter X, would that let me do this?\n Any suggestions on getting our switch to do this type of routing?\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ArkhonMSP  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I have recently been trying to find out a deep dive into what exactly networking ports are. This is regarding TCP and UDP ports.\n Whenever I search what exactly are networking ports, I see explanations about how they are a way to identify a service. \n I have not seen explanations on how this is achieved.\n When a server receives a request on port 22, the TCP/IP stack inspects the destination port, and sees the number 22 there. Is the TCP/IP stack configured in such a way that each port number must be associated with a certain service, like if the number is 22, then forward the request to the sshd service?\n After the TCP/IP stack inspects the port number, will it forward the request to the relevant service - sshd in this case?\n I have thought of ports as \"gates\" to remotely access a service. Each service has its own PID, but this PID stays local, so ports are a way to access these services remotely. We won't be able to remotely access the service by its PID. But we can access the service if there is a TCP/IP stack that does the forwarding of request based on the destination port number?\n The questions above are just my own explanation of how ports are bound to services, and how the TCP/IP stack assists in forwarding the request to the relevant service. If anybody has knowledge in this, it would be great for someone to share it.\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/arthu_sp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there a way to turn that down or off?\n EDIT: I have eve-ng pro 5.0.1-20, it's recently installed.

This partially helped my problem, I noticed slightly less disk IO, but there was still a lot. It maybe decreased things by 10-25%. But the overall disk usage will not continually climb from the /var/lib/mysql/binlog.xxxxxx files.\n iotop showed this yet: 567481 be/4 mysql 0.00 B/s 551.38 K/s ?unavailable? mysqld [ib_pg_flush_co]\n ib_pg_flush_co was still writing a lot. So I did an strace of that process and it was doing io_submit about once a second. I just happened to google the very last option in the mysqld.cnf file \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2\". A quick google suggests that it forces a write cycle once a second.\n  \n edited \"innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2\" from 2 to 1 (the default), and restarted mysql again.\n  \nEDIT2: This only worked temporarily.

          "description": "I'm trying to setup LLDP on my Cisco 9300 switches to allow my Poly phones to determine their location for E911 on Zoom. I have only used CDP, and with the voice vlan, the phones figure out what vlan they need to be, and life's great. But, when I try to dial 933 to verify the more granular E911 location, it can't seem to sort out the MAC address of the switch it's connected to so it can be more precise.\n So far, I ran lldp run on the switch, and it seems to now be on. If I run show lldp neighbors, I get all the phones, APs, and other junk on the switch. But, the phone still doesn't seem to know what's going on. Running LDWin on a client machine to read the LLDP packets doesn't yield any results either. Either I'm getting erroneous results, or LLDP isn't configured correctly.\n Looking at the Cisco documentation, it looks like I may need to run lldp transmit and lldp receive on the specific interfaces, but that hasn't gotten me anywhere either. Oddly enough, the commands do not error out, but if I show the running config for the interface, those commands don't show up in the config. At the bottom of the post is the current interface config.\n I'm certain I'm missing something simple and obvious, but this is kicking my butt.\n Port config:\n switchport access vlan 10 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 90 authentication event fail action authorize vlan 64 authentication event server dead action authorize vlan 64 authentication event no-response action authorize vlan 64 authentication event server alive action reinitialize authentication host-mode multi-domain authentication port-control auto authentication periodic authentication violation replace mab dot1x pae authenticator dot1x timeout quiet-period 15 dot1x timeout tx-period 10 spanning-tree portfast spanning-tree bpduguard enable \n    submitted by    /u/smalltimesysadmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "First, I inherited this nightmare, it isn’t my creation. I’m just tasked with making this whole thing work and so far I’m at an almost complete loss on the best way to segment this mess. It’s a fairly large subnet class c /21 with everything (and I do mean everything) on a single network. One of the biggest hurdles that I’ve had is diagnosing where the current loops are due to the Unifi system meshing (if meshing is turned off, nothing works which tells me it wasn’t designed correctly to begin with). So I’m trying to come up with a new design that will use what I’ve been given (they went building to building instead of each building back to the core due to the costs for horizontal boring). I’ve got two actual routers (Cisco) and some newer Catalyst 9200’s which are capable of full L3 routing (full meaning they can use an actual routing protocol and not just static). \n My first thought is to segment out each building with it’s own network and VLAN but I am at a loss on making it so everything can still get to everything (this is a live production/manufacturing facility so they cannot go down).The only way to really isolate the loops that remain (this network grew at rapid speed over about 20 years - things just kept being added on and not properly tracked) is to attempt to use the Catalyst devices as “border routers”. I’ve been working in this field for over 20 years and I can honestly say, this is the first network that hasn’t been a standard full mesh or hub and spoke design. So I’m reaching out to the wise folks on here to see if I’m going about this the right way or if perhaps someone out there has experience with such a thing and can give me some pointers. I’ve been removing every hub/non managed switch I can find as I come across them because they seem to quite literally be everywhere lol along with documenting how everything actually connects for future reference.\n    submitted by    /u/Corsoboundheart  \n [link]   [comments]",

Catalyst core, but still trunking is working for everything and there are very few problems (except Playstations. FU Playstations). \n But we have these CBORD devices that handle Student Payments (at Soda Machines, et al) and Card Swipy devices for CheckIn type things. When plugged into the Catalyst they work just fine. No PoE needed and they pull their reserved IP no problem. Can see it on the Catalyst CLI, can Ping it, everything is great. \n Swap that plug to a Meraki switch and the port DOESN'T EVEN ACTIVATE. No link lights, nothing. As far as Meraki is telling me there is no device plugged into that port. I've tried multiple ports on multiple switches now - same issue. Works on Catalyst just fine, Meraki doesn't want anything to do with it. The VLAN in use is one of the most widely used VLANs but I still went up and down the line to verify connectivity. \n Has anyone ever encountered anything like this?\n    submitted by    /u/GreenChileEnchiladas  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m conducting an experiment for my studies where I am measuring routing protocol convergence performance in a simulated and real hardware environment. \n I am struggling to make sense of how to calculate the convergence itself. Do I ping the host on the other end of the network continuously, and then shutdown an interface and time a change or do I simulate a data packet through Cisco simulation during which I shutdown the port to see how the routing protocol reacts?\n For my simulated part I am using the CPT simulator. For my real hardware I plan on using a Wireshark. Has anyone any idea how to measure the convergence times?

I have enjoyed them both greatly but at the moment would choose EVE-NG.\n Right now I have a MacBook so virtualisation is not really an option for me since it is Silicon/ARM based. Google Cloud is too expensive for the amount of CPUs and RAM I need for a good lab (>24vCPU and 48RAM, also the resources are not always available in zones which is really frustrating). I could just buy a used bare-metal server for my virtualisation but I am not sure I will have room for it but it is an option I am considering.\n I need the to emulate different vendors so CML is not an option for me as well.\n Could you suggest the most practical and least expensive way to setup a lab?\n What has your experience been with it?

All other clients (including the server 2019 backup domain controller) can ping the Mikrotik.\n A tracert to the switch from the PDC server shows no connectivity, however the server is reachable from other clients connected to the switch.\n Tracing route to mt [192.168.x.y]\n over a maximum of 30 hops:\n 1 * * * Request timed out.\n 2 * * * Request timed out.\n 3 * * * Request timed out.\n Thus far I have:\n  \nRebooted the Mikrotik\n Rebooted the server in question (PDC)\n Changed ethernet cables\n Changed port the PDC is connected to on the Mikrotik to a port that another server 2019 instance was able to successfully ping from\n Tested ping from all other clients on the subnet\n Verified server IP is part of the same subnet as the switch IP.\n Disabled the windows firewall - had no impact\n  \nThe PDC is directly connected to the switch. I'm able to ping the gateway on the other side of the switch, and am able to ping all clients connected to the switch.\n Network topology is quite simple. All clients connected to the Mikrotik, and a single router upstream connected to the modem.\n Any thoughts on how to re-establish pings from this server? I have a monitoring app that reports uptime from this server (I know...I know...shouldn't be on a PDC), and right now it is reporting the switch is down. This started yesterday. Previous to that there were no issues. No changes to the PDC have been made, which makes this even more confusing.\n Thanks everyone,\n Cal.\n    submitted by    /u/calvadosboulard  \n [link]   [comments]",

RP ports are connected back to back and TE0/1/0 from each WLC are connected to the core switch.\n When I disconnect the f.o. port from the active controller the other one takes control, and that's fine. The former active controller, however, have to reboot itself before completing the active to standby transistion (don't know why it needs to reboot but that's the way Cisco decided...): if I reconnect the fiber cable BEFORE the unit is rebooted, it will completely freeze. No output whatsoever on the console and the box is completely dead until I disconnect and reconnect the power cable.\n Has anyone seen this behaviour?\n Bye, Dario\n    submitted by    /u/draven_76  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know NAC is the solution but our company is impotent and unable to sort out the management policy side of things to actually implement it. In the meantime I am scanning our network with various tools I have and kicking off devices that break the current policies I am allowed to enforce. Have been using Zenmap on Mac but was wondering if there was a better version or option out there that is free/open source? Perhaps something that can be installed on a server and present scans or reports in a nicer way? We have some other tools that can fingerprint but they mostly rely on DHCP relay to get info so are only useful for DHCP devices and don't see stuff on static IPs. Any suggestions of tools welcome. I appreciate this isn't cyber security sub but I am a network engineer and looking at ultimately discovering as many of these devices as possible to boot them off until management pulls their fingers out and allows us to implement NAC.

When I do a \"show interface status\", I do not see the 1 gig ports, only the 10 gig ports.\n    submitted by    /u/GC_Player  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all, got a bit of a strange situation I stumbled upon. For reference this post deals with two separate sites that are unable to communicate with one another (or correctly at least). For simplicity I'm going to refer to them as Site A and Site B and the majority of the IT team including myself works at a different branch from the two.\n I first became aware of the issue when a member of the helpdesk team brought up that Site A can't communicate with Site B. Surface level this appeared to be true as he had run ping tests from the DC at Site A to the gateway at Site B receiving \"Request timed out.\" response. However, Site B can ping Site A without issue... I assumed that this is some sort of blocking issue with one of the FortiGate's since one of the sites can send ICMP echo packets it wouldn't be a routing issue. But I see nothing related to the ping tests shown in the logs on Site A or Site B's FortiGate. I would run a pcap but the deployed models do not have onboard memory unfortunately.\n Then it started to get a bit confusing, I ran a trace route from a VM at Site A to Site B and it completed without issue. The sequence of hops was as follows: Site A VM -> Site A Layer 3 Switch -> Site A FortiGate -> Site B FortiGate -> Site B Layer 3 Switch -> destination IP.\n Out of curiosity I ran a perpetual ping test from Site A to Site B for 10~ minutes and shockingly saw a couple successful ping attempts among all the \"Request timed out.\" responses (98% loss for reference). Site A is also able to communicate with all of our other sites without issue.\n Any advice or tips for this? This one is starting to make my head spin and I feel I may be missing something obvious.\n Edit: Forgot to mention - Site B responds to ping from all of our other sites without issue.\n    submitted by    /u/Happy-Drive9316  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since then we have migrated to their hybrid drive solution with an expensive ,windows server running the server software and a windows plugin on each computer serving files from the cloud or the server, depending on location. The search path for all files remain the same. A great server solution with hardware costs remainso nothing. Useful and straightforward, in theory.\n In reality: The service is expensive since we have a lot of server data (around 10TB) and the hybrid software makes the work in our CAD software very slow since each work session loads hundreds of files and the hybrid software/server solution becomes incredibly slow. In reality, we need to sync all folders locally even when we are on our LAN with a server.\n As an administrator without any professional knowledge of IT systems, it is near impossible for me to find other alternatives and compare the pricing and functionality.

I will preface this with I have been in DevOps for 2 years and am comfortable in AWS, however networking in general is not a strong point in any way, so if this is dumb - I can take it. \n We have a project which requires a site-to-site VPN from our AWS VPC to a customer who is running Cisco ASA. I have had the VPN set up in various ways because they keep changing requirements. However that latest requirement I am not sure how to handle. \n Their statement is - \"We look for interesting traffic on our router and when it finds it, it creates the tunnel and closes it when no longer used\". So it sounds like a tunnel on-demand thing? Now, the only information we have are the endpoints in their network which we access through the tunnel. How do we send \"interesting\" traffic for them to create the tunnel if we need the tunnel to send our traffic? \n I keep thinking that they didn't give us an important piece of information - like this magical endpoint. Or are we supposed to initiate the tunnel? It seems like a very chicken-and-egg situation that I am not able to wrap my head around. \n As I said - networking neophyte here but desperately looking for some understanding of what he is talking about.

We built a NetMotion Secure Access server on our server VLAN (10.1.4.0), with the intent of having VPN clients reach out to a DHCP server and get an IP from a newly created 10.1.74.0/24 range. However, I'm trying to conceptualize how this would work with regards to routing and our firewalls. A couple of notes:\n  \nNetMotion, as far as I know, has no configurable static routing/VLAN assignment/etc\n In order for clients to get an IP from the desired range, we give the server an IP to use from it (10.1.74.5). The server sends DHCP requests using that address\n  \nWith that said, I suppose my question two-fold:\n  \nHow exactly would that work? If our firewall sees packets from the 10.1.74.0 subnet coming in on the server VLAN, it will block them, correct? Is there a logical way to allow access without creating a bunch of weird access policies?\n How do we configure routes for traffic destined for the VPN subnet? Would it be as simple as creating a static route that points to the server's IP? Any past experience I've had with VPN involved them living on firewalls that did all of our routing, so it seems foreign doing things this way.\n  \nAny thoughts you folks have would be appreciated.

Owner is kind of down, Co-owner who is 20 years younger is less down and thinks its absolutely not worth it and will barely impact our workflow. \n I've done a rough estimate on the plugs we actually use in the building, about 700' worth of cable so we'd buy a 1000' spool. My concern is the owners wife wants the building to be usable for the next person if they ever sell. When they built the place in 2006, they ran the Cat5 IN THE WALL using the \"Home Run\" method, where they drilled holes in every.. 2x4... and pulled the ethernet cable through. The owner is pretty sure they also stapled them to the 2x4s every so often. So there is no way of pulling them out. I think we reuse the current ethernet outlet spot, ditch the cable in the wall, and back in the \"network closet\" we shove the cat 5 cable in the wall and patch the drywall. Unless there is another use for Cat5 I'm not aware of that would be a good reason to get a dual plug and actually have both and make both usable. That would kind of solve both issues. Anyone have any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/Unlucky-Sherbert-873  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Multi Gig Small Office recommendations\n Hi Networking! I’m primarily an AV engineer but a facility I work with is looking to expand their 10 gig network. It’s a small office, less than 50 users (currently somewhere around 20 but may expand in the next few years), with several file servers on premise and a couple internet accessible services (behind reverse proxy through Argo tunnel). \n What we need: -10GBe access layer to the workstations. -high reliability -Ability to VLAN/ACL various devices for access to various file servers. So basically, nothing unmanaged. -Likely higher throughput trunks between servers and switches, and between switches. All our servers are equipped with 4x10gbe. Probably a good implementation of LACP and STP. -that’s it!\n What we would like: -centralized-ish management, ability to manage with APs would be a huge bonus. \n What we don’t really need: -POE\n Currently I run Meraki at my office, and I think this would be perfect but the cost of getting several MS355-24X (otherwise a perfect switch) might be prohibitive, and the license would compound that. I also run an Aruba Instant On network (automod removed my post for saying where), and their 1960 12XGT looks very interesting and priced very well, but I haven’t used any of their multi gig offerings. I like the ability to integrate with their wifi6 APs at a great price point too. Also highly considering the Cisco CBS 350 12XT and CBS 350 24XT. \n Just looking for opinions and thoughts!

Client of mine has an office for creative marketing and they have about 30 people in at a time using various applications(social media,Dropbox,zoom,google meets) they have a shared gigabit connection from isp and dedicated ethernet is not an option unfortunately. They are hard set on keeping the sonicwall and they haven’t been able to find anyone willing to configure it properly for them so I offered to check it out. The issue they are having is during peak time is buffering,web pages not loading etc… I took a look into there sonicwall and there is no bandwidth management configured at all. Just one CFS rule for default content filtering. My question is there a straight forward way to set up bandwidth profiles or a global rule to limit bandwidth for each user? My guess is out of the 30 users a few are uploading heavily to Dropbox and saturating the circuit.\n    submitted by    /u/whatsareddit23  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I've been thinking about expanding this to include more L1 Information that easily gets lost in Diagrams and Spreadsheets.\n Some ideas:\n  \nFibre patch lead connector type (e.g. lc/sc)\n Fibre patch lead tip (APC/UPC) [Optional, default would be UPC]\n Patch lead length (e.g. 3m)\n Horizontal Fibre type (e.g. om3, os2)\n Patch Panel location (e.g. <RACKID>-#RU)\n  \nThe description would look something like this:\n <hostname> Uplink - pl=lc-sc-om4, tip=upc-upc, len=3m, hz=om3, loc=BB1-RU21 \n From the above, I can quickly tell that there is a 3m LC/SC OM4 UPC patch lead connected from $this device to BB1-RU21 which is a Horizontal run of OM3. \n This could also be collapsed into a shorter form like:\n <hostname> Uplink - pl=lc-sc-upc-upc-3m-om4, hz=om3, loc=BB1-RU21 \n Does anyone think this is overloading the description of an Interface with excessive L1 Information? Should we be pulling this out into something like Netbox (We currently have no roadmap for Netbox). Or should be collapsed down into a Link ID and stored outside of the device configuration?\n Benefits I see:\n  \nInformation is close to the hardware, less likely chance of being sprawled into Documentation that doesn't get an update\n \nThis information is presented directly in our alerts when the link goes down\n \nNo need to bring multiple different Patch-Leads to a job if the link goes down. Correct leads and connectors, each time.\n \n If you're doing this, would you mind sharing your standard?\n    submitted by    /u/pingdrop  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We have a school that is occasionally maxing out a 1Gb connection from their ISP. ISP tells us that two 1Gb connections will be significantly more affordable than the single 2Gb connection they offer. This initially seemed great because we have 1 group of traffic we want to use one of the connections and 1 group of traffic we want to use the other connection. ISP is using GPON and I suspect they will give me an IP address for the second connection that is in the same subnet as the IP for the first connection and thus would have the same gateway. Most PBR scenarios I've seen set the next-hop IP based on the source network, but in this case the next-hop IP would be the same for both connections. Firewall at school is an ASA 5516-X. I initially preferred to use just a single firewall, but I do have some extra 5506-X I could deploy if necessary, recognizing the 5506-X won't do the full 1Gb. I'm not completely familiar with GPON, but perhaps I could request the second connection have an IP in a different subnet? \n Thinking a bit further, the school ASA in question currently has a VPN tunnel back to the datacenter ASA. I assume the school ASA is not going to establish a VPN tunnel to the datacenter from both of its IP Addresses, so I assume this is where a default route would come in and all traffic from both school subnets that need to traverse VPN tunnel would use the default route?\n    submitted by    /u/yllw98stng  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each provider has a 10 Gbps capacity, and are received on a switch, on SFP+ ports, except one of them that is connected to a QSFP+ port. For the BGP peering, will only accept a default route from each of the providers, i.e., we're not interested in Full-BGP support, the BGP peerings are there so that we can send a couple of IPv4 and IPv6 routes. For internal routing, we have an OSPF networtk with a routing table with about 7000 routes at the backbone.\n The thing is, our Mikrotik CCR1072 edge router is not scaling well, and we're planning on getting much more bandwidth on a couple of months. The current throughput is around 15 Gbps, and we're estimating that we will double it before july. \n I'm thinking of getting a L3 Switch with 40G/100G uplink that could connect to the edge switch, and manage the 3 peerings on this new switch (as a BGP edge router), so it will also handle the traffic. What L3 switch would you guys you recommend? I'd like a switch that could handle, say, 80 Gbps of routing? Considering the 3 peerings, and the 7000 OSPF routes.\n We're also evaluating buying a new router, but Cisco and Juniper routers are basically too expensive right now, and checking out FS.COM I saw a couple of switches that could probably do the job, like this bare metal switch https://www.fs.com/products/69226.html. \n Do you have any recommendations at a $10k-$15k budget?\n    submitted by    /u/engineering_hugo  \n [link]   [comments]",

The one we are having issues with is VLAN 1/Subnet 72, which has inverters 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 8.1, 8.2, 9.1, 9.2.\n On December 16th, we had our first issue, where inverters 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 8.1, 8.2, 9…",

          "description": "I have a VLAN dedicated for equipment supplied by outside vendors that need internet access. All endpoints on this VLAN will be a device that will connect a VPN back to it's individual vendors home office to give them remote management access. \n Most of these devices come with a fairly well documented list of access requirements for the VPN to function. Meaning that the vendor has provided all the information needed to lock down the connection. This is great! But, to me, it is kind of silly to go to all the trouble of locking down 90% of these appliances if the other 10% are not well secured, get compromised, and end up allowing open access to everything else on that layer2 subnet. \n I already have the vlan/subnet locked down so that it has zero access to the internal network. But I would like to take it a step further by locking down layer2 communication in that vlan/subnet so that each endpoint can only communicate with the gateway (fortinet 80f) and outside internet. \n Rough breakdown of my hardware in place it as follows:\n Internet > Fortigate 80f > mdf-access - Cisco 3850 > core-switch - Cisco Nexus 3548P > idf-access - Cisco 3850 > Vendor Endpoints\n Internal network gateways live on the nexus 3548p which also handles the internal routing.\n Guest and isolated vlan/subnet gateways live on the fortigate. No routing other than sending traffic to the internet. On the switches, there is just the layer2 vlan configured, no layer3 svi. \n So, is configuring private vlans my best bet here? https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/a-quick-summarized-view-to-private-vlan-pvlan-x\n Or is there a better way to isolate layer2 endpoints? Am I overthinking this?\n Also, let me know if I left out any information that would be useful for a recommendation. \n ​\n Thank you for any thoughts or advice!\n    submitted by    /u/bigTractor  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Question for anyone who used NSO with CARE to automate STIGs.\n So we had call yesterday with a few guys from Cisco to discuss us potentially ordering Cisco NSO. The main reason for purchasing is to use their CARE product which will allow us to automate STIG checking and filling out the STIG checklists for us, among other things.\n During this meeting the guy referenced anislble alot and said that NSO using a lot of ansible playbooks to do these checks. Even when he showed us the output of some of the checks, i noticed that it is the same output that I would get from ansible. Everything from what it prints down to even the color it prints in.\n So my question. Everything that NSO CARE does for checking STIGS (compliance checks, differences between golden configs and all other configs, filling out STIG checklists, etc.), could it all be done with ansible playbooks? I have some experience with ansible and python, and I have my own playbooks/scripts that do compliance checks, check differences between configs, tell me what STIG findings are open, etc. The only thing I really havn't figured out how to do yet that I really would like to be able to do is automate filling out the checklists. Not sure if thats possible with an ansible playbook or not.\n TLDR: Is Cisco NSO with CARE worth the cost, or can I just do everything with Ansible?\n    submitted by    /u/GC_Player  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I am working on a project right now and there is a change in ip address space of the ISP, they are moving from x.x.x.0/24 (old address space) address to y.y.y.0/24 (new address space). Both ranges are currently rout'able through the existing gateways but after the end of this week only y.y.y.0/24 will be available for us to use.\n The current problem we are facing is that we already setup everything in y.y.y.0/24 address space in advance (interface, gateway, nat, security policy etc), but there seems to be some issue with NAT overload (trusted to untrusted) rules and we are seeing the issues mostly with SIP and RTP traffic. The issue is that even if we have configured ip y.y.y.y on the untrusted/outside interface and have a NAT rule for outbound traffic (to use interface), the firewall is taking the old ip configured on the outside interface (x.x.x.x). Not sure why it's behaving like this for SIP and RTP but most of the other traffic is using the new IP (y.y.y.y). \n We verified if the traffic is hitting the correct policy using test and it's hitting the correct NAT rule and shows the correct translated address. But checking the active sessions using the show session commands shows it's not using the current interface ip but the old ip of the interface. We verified the output of the show session against the corresonding NAT rule and we can see the SIP/RTP sessions under that rule but using old ip as a translated source address.\n The firewall is on 8.1 version and upgrading is not an option right now as we are in a process of migrating the firewalls. Tried clearing the sessions, removing and re-adding the NAT rule, but this buggy behaviour exist. Should I disable SIP ALG/inspection and allow traffic through security policy?\n Apologies for the long post and any help is really appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/bobbythomastvm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I'm working with Cisco and Arista VXLAN Fabrics. We usually build them for small and midsize enterprises. Sometimes bigger ones. For me, most DCs have around 50 switches. \n But, after everything is finished and we take a look in the EVPN table, we find that they can get pretty big. Sadly most customers want \"every vlan everywhere!!!11\" which certainly won't help with scalability. As we have to add a VLAN to 50 switches, even if it's only used on 2 switches. \n After we did dig a bit in scalability and how to minimize table entries (depending on BGP design obviously). We are not sure how big someone could scale a standard VXLAN EVPN Fabric. Someone told me \"around 400 switchs, then it gets janky\" another one said \"we have 2000 switches in a campus VXLAN EVPN fabric, everything is fine\". So, how far can we/you go? What are the limits?\n I'm not talking about the routing table of the switches, of course some switches will fill their tables earlier than others. But if you use switches with millions of possible entieries, where is the limit?\n I know already that the public clouds don't use a DC network like the ones we build. They have \"software\" on their servers for their fabric and don't have all that state in their network. It wouldn't scale that big.\n    submitted by    /u/onyx9  \n [link]   [comments]",
