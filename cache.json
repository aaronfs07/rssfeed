Something like these: https://www.bestcolleges.com/bootcamps/guides/top-cybersecurity-competitions/, but ones that I control to whip out and use outside of competition days.\n Essentially, the way I see it working is that I produce a linux VM, make some insecure changes (no updates, passwords changed to 1234, password requirements, chmod 777 some config files, random executable in home dir, no anti-virus, etc.) and then get the kids to find and fix those changes, and get scored on the number of fixes they do.\n I can do all this with scripts etc. to check various scenarios and build the images, but I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas on where to start or if they have an idea of scoring or any issues that should be included.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/kolonuk  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is an IP in /ets/resolv.conf that can be used to access Windows but firewall blocks all requests from WSL by default, after some digging i could not find a way to fix it with firewall rules so i tried to disable firewall just for WSL's virtual network adapter and it worked.\n Here is powershell command, that i use: Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Public -DisabledInterfaceAliases \"vEthernet (WSL)\"\n I does the thing as i said but the problem is that every time i disable/enable firewall with it, firewall spits out permission prompts for every program that i already permitted before. Sometimes it is very annoying, especeially when permissions are reset for my DLNA and network sharing sevices and i can no longer access my PC via local network.\n Is there something that i'm doing wrong?

I've been a Systems Engineer previously for about 10 or so years.\n I can either go back to my old job possibly but no one on my team is there aside from two people, or try to find a new job that is remote only. I've been fortunate that my last 2 jobs out of 3, I've put my heart in and have gotten promotions and been able to do things that helped the company. With my latest it's just not the same.\n Has anyone been in the same boat? There are some people that got me here at my current job and I feel like I might burn bridges but I want to have that fire back in. I just feel like I work best devoted my time to fix things at a company as opposed to coming in, doing a project and leaving. I hate the feeling of starting a project with a bunch of new people and rinsing and repeating with other new people. It causes so much anxiety for me.

TLDR of that post was management was changing policy flip flopping back and forth and making our jobs harder because of it.\n I spent a lot of time at the old place complaining, and wallowing in my self pity. Thinking that I wasnt good enough and that there was no way another company would hire me. I blamed management for my unhappiness which is partially true but in the end it was my fault for staying and letting them make me unhappy.\n On the flip side yesterday I had my 6 month review at my new job that went spectacular. I found a place that is supportive and listens to employees to improve the company. It's not perfect by any means but no where really is. Since I've been here my mental health has improved, I've been eating better and I've lost ~60lbs. I'm learning more than ever and have the ability to move up in the company.\n Please remember that no job is worth your health. If you are not happy or your health, both physical or mental is declining, leaving is better than staying.

This thing just hangs up from time to time.\"\n After a few minutes The number of times I hear the words \"Did that; same error\" only to find their uptime being over a day is increasingly annoying. \n This feels new and I think people are getting dumber and lazier.

If the box got compromised it would be game over.\n In order to get the key they would have to exploit some creds to get into the box but its the sheer lateral movement/access that is gotten if these keys are misappropriated that worries me.\n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/IT_ISNT101  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is only MariaDB running on this server and the kernel log file shows me that only MariaDB is consuming RAM when the OOM occurs.\n Is this only an issue of too low RAM to run this database ?\n Any help is welcome and if I can provide any other information just ask, I'm getting reallllyyyy desperate !

My plan over the course of the next month was to Fully migrate away from the on Prem server anyway as there is no need for it any more. All of our Microsoft services are cloud based. We have no on site applications. All machines are connected via Azure and linked up to intune. So really all we use the on Prem server for is creating accounts. \n My question is... What would the implications be of just leaving the server in its current state seeing as though I was going to be getting rid of it anyway. Do the current users get converted to Cloud users automatically \n ...or is it advisable to restore from backups and carry out the steps of stopping syncs at both ends etc.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/BittenDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't find a single redeeming quality to this system. Every issue requires SSH access to the controller VMs, and either a pile of CLI or direct intervention from their support staff. In a 10+ year career I've never talked to support so much in such a short amount of time. Every firmware upgrade of the underlying host turns into a multi hour nightmare with crazy 2+ hour timeouts before a failure message. Every single feature down to what should be the simplest thing is manual, or a ratking of python scripts behind a sleek UI with bad progress reporting.

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I'm trying to connect 4 different iscsi targets provided by a NAS with powershell. I don't want to connect them all at once but rather separately, one at a time (first target1, then target2 and so on).\n So far I've had success geting the target names with get-iscsitarget and piping this to a select-string which then chooses the target I want to connect (target1 for the first target). I then pipe that to connect-iscsitarget but here's my problem: This will assign the first available driveletter to the target. I want to assign specific letters, for example target1 gets W:, target2 gets X: and so on).\n But I cannot for the life of me find the command needed for this. All I can find is how to get driveletters from already connected targets and similat stuff.\n Any ideas? Am I missing something here?\n Thanks and have a good one!\n    submitted by    /u/-sbl-  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All\n Yesterday we had an alert from Microsoft 365 Defender (our Licenses are on 365 E5) notifying us of “Ransomware-linked emerging threat activity group detected “. Yikes!\n To cut a long story short, our security stack has contained the threat and the single device in question is nuked – We looped in 3rd party security to sense check everything.\n The threat was a Gootloader infection and Google suggests this is particularly nasty and sophisticated. The payload is a zip file with a .js file inside and from our investigation, the .js script needs to be executed, launched via WScriptexe. We implement best practice in our IT stack and are on-top of hardening our environment where ever possible. In this instance the payload was downloaded to a temp directory where Applocker blocks execution. But had the zip/.js file been downloaded to the desktop, it would have potentially executed.\n 1 suggested rudimentary mitigation for this is to change the file association of .js files (via Group Policy) to open with Notepad so if a user does click a .js file, it will harmlessly open in notepad - We have done this. \n But I have seen further recommendations to do the same for .vbs, .vbe, .jse, .hta and .wsf. I’m wondering if anyone else does this and if this could break anything for end users?\n    submitted by    /u/mythumbsclick  \n [link]   [comments]",

For some reason this relative decided rather than going to me when they had a problem they would run straight to the local \"repair shop\" as he apparently was chatted up by one of their staff while he was at the chippy.\n This \"repair shop\" (and I use this dubiously) has made a fucking botch to put it lightly. They claimed he had a virus and that his \"hard drive\" (actually an SSD) was destroyed by it and he would need a replacement which he happily agreed to. They installed a \"new\" hard drive and sent it back to him, obviously with slower performance on acc. of having an SSD swapped for a HDD and no effort made to reinstall any of the laptop's basic drivers which can be pulled off the manufacturer's site with a few minutes on Googles, so this relative had no sound, no WiFi (lucky they use a cable connection, really!) and a prompt to activate Windows.\n When they took it back, they had the sense to call me this time. When I went back with this relative, they had kindly replaced his hard drive with a \"solid state drive\" and would only charge him £150, what a fucking deal! I actually had a look at the laptop at the shop and it was in the same state as before, no effort to reinstall any drivers, probably was just the same SSD they took out reinstalled and sold back to him at cost, and a prompt to activate Windows. I quite bluntly told them to fuck off, gave them an earful and walked out with my relative and the laptop in tow. Considering either legal or lethal action to get these tw@s to stop bothering him.\n Also, the fucking screws are threaded on the underside so good luck to me getting into that fucker again. At least they had the decency to install another SSD but that's nearly £100 of this relative's money down the fucking drain.\n    submitted by    /u/WindowScam2023  \n [link]   [comments]",

They have to connect with one of the other session hosts. On that session host it works for 1-2 days and afterwards the same issue occurs.\n The software is not installed on the vms but is started directly from a mapped network drive. It doesn't add or edit registry keys and only caches files in one specific folder in AppData. We already excluded that folder from the FSLogix redirection but it didn't make a difference.\n The only solution that works is to delete the FSLogix profile and create a new one.\n Additionally, Excel doesn't seem to work great either. Users have to restart it every few minutes because of freezing and crashing. Same thing, if the FSLogix profile will be deleted and be newly created it works again for a few days.\n So it seems there is something wrong with FSLogix. We already updated to the newest version and tried both normal caching and cloud cache.\n Weirdly I couldn't find anything or anyone on google regarding to this issue.\n Did anyone of you experience similiar issues or has an idea how to fix this? \n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/_Xephyr_  \n [link]   [comments]",

The document is not printed until an admin connects to the server via RDP connection. After the RDP connection, all documents are printed out. This applies to all printers that are connected via a print server.\n 1.) The print server can be reached permanently via ping, even in the morning.\n 2.) LAN card (Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power) is not checked.\n 3.) VMware Tools up to date\n I suspect that during the night some service hangs up. However, I have no idea which one.\n Have you already had a similar phenomenon and can you give me a tip in which event log I can find it?\n    submitted by    /u/spectre5432  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently we seem to be getting multiple tickets almost daily about users monitors, keyboards, and mice not working when they go to sign in for the day. If I turn off certain DMA protections everything works like it should. I have proposed to my management that we should consider disabling these for the sake of making this easier for our users.

But I'm hoping that somewhere out there, someone has faced the same issue and maybe even found a fix.\n We have a bunch of Windows 10 Pro clients, and some Windows 11 Pro clients, which were initially on-prem domain joined, but have since become hybrid joined with AAD.\n My issue is that our users (about 500) have license for Microsoft 365 Business Premium, but only about half of the clients are running Business, the rest is stuck on Pro.\n Now, for some reason, it's exceptionally difficult to find any documentation on how this edition change actually works or should happen. Everything on MS, both on Learn and TechNet concerns Enterprise only, and even our CSP's licensing experts couldn't give a straight answer. (The first guy I spoke to, even claimed that there was no such thing as \"Windows 10 Business\"... o.O )\n Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a KMS key specifically for \"Business\", because if there was, I could just have the clients run a slmgr script silently, and that'd be the end of it -- and \"just buy E3\" (as another \"expert\" from our CSP suggested) is not en option either.\n Any insights, pointers or even encouraging comments are highly welcome and greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Imposing-Force  \n [link]   [comments]",

That's not my point....\n I got a request this morning and there are two ways to do it. One takes 15 steps, the other way takes 2. The easy way is modifying the config. I wasn't 100% sure which setting it was so...

My point was - these vms are going to eat up every fucking thing you give them and well end up in a never ending loop of adding resources and you'll never remember that I said it would happen.

He's not a managing Sr, he's supposed to be a working Sr admin, which has been made abundantly clear to him via our chain several times, yet still there's next to no production from his office. I can't get a raise because then I'll make more than he does, and I can't get promoted because he doesn't have any place that'll take him, he has a bad work history within our department and is frankly lucky to even have a job at this point. \n My question is...do I keep sticking around and trudging forward in the hopes that eventually the ice will break and I'll get a chance to move? Or do I just pick up my toys and go play someplace else where I can gain traditional IT experience that will go towards my resume if I choose to move again later on?

They offered me the job based on my troubleshooting and Windows admin skill. I was able to quickly get up to speed on the day to day tasks, and after about a month I started tackling a bigger project: the Windows deployment image that was set up by a technician who had left some time ago. It had been put in place in 2015 and has been trucking along ever since. Slowly gaining more and more issues as it aged, but not enough for it to be an emergency.

Then After the 2nd update we've added the auditing and we do see audit entries related to accounts that won't work after the final updates. \n We're trying to get way ahead of this so we don't have as many issues by the time all is said and done and honestly we're really lost on how to handle this. We've been wondering if we need to automate the adjustment to all existing AD accounts and computer objects? Is this going to affect anything that makes an LDAP call instead of LDAPS? Are we overthinking it and it's actually not a big deal and it all works itself out through all of the updates? \n We just don't quite understand everything that's happening related to these updates and we'd rather cause some little bumps to get everything ready early versus one massive downtime issue when Microsoft sends out the last update and enforces the new encryption types.\n    submitted by    /u/xtigermaskx  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In order to increase room on the network for our rapidly growing office (with many lab devices as well), we decided to split the wireless network into a separate VLAN/subnet. That's all well and good but our three printers (HP MFPs) are all Ethernet only. Our original subnet that remains ethernet based is 10.1.26.0 /24 and the new WLAN one is 10.1.29.0 /24. They are connected on the back end via our Cisco layer three switch and talk to each other fine. \n People, when they're hard-wired, are able to print with no issue as before. However, I noticed that when on the new wireless network, they are having trouble reaching the printers that they have added on the other, hardwired based subnet with the drivers they have (though of course they can ping and access the web interface IPs fine). So far the solution is to remove those old drivers (added through the basic Microsoft 'add a printer' feature), go to the HP website and download/install the full official driver, skip past the step where it scans the network and can't find anything, and then manually input the IP address of the printer on the other subnet of 10.1.26.0. This then seems to work for both the wireless and ethernet subnets. But it is a few extra steps and a bit of work for the users, who sometimes may get confused or don't have time.\n Also, I noticed if you just use the basic Microsoft 'add a printer', 'can't find printer I'm looking for', 'manually enter the printer IP address', it just finds some generic or universal print driver that is not the most descriptive or useful, as it can't seem to find or offer an option for the actual precise driver.\n Anyway my main question is, is there a simpler way to do this, and advertise the printer easily and directly on both networks, or just make the existing printer installs on user machines work on both?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/overling  \n [link]   [comments]",

Users who log in to their laptops have access to the internet, and then when some lock their computers and come back to it, the heartbeats aren't sent to the firewall and they're blocked from accessing the internet until they restart the laptop.\n We have a 3rd party who provide the equipment for us and \"manages\" them, and we've been on at them for 18 months about this issue. Their response tends to be to run a piece of software that pulls the logs from the machine which is then sent to Sophos. We've done this for so long with no real solution to the issue. I get the feeling the issue is with Sophos as they don't know (or care) why this is happening, so things are just stuck.\n I've been asked by my boss to find an alternative to Sophos XG Firewall, as a number of users are losing chunks of the day from having to restart their computers to get back on to the internet. The firewall must be user aware, so that we can apply specific rules to these users. \n Can anyone suggest an alternative?

          "description": "During the 2020 lockdowns we got fairly settled with a remote working configuration that involves our remote team using RDP on a thin client of sorts, remotely controlling a remote Windows 11 Pro workstation (via a VPN). We then either use a work smartphone for VOIP calls, or using remote audio redirection via RDP. Remote audio redirection works OK if latency is low (under 30ms), but we now have someone who has over 150ms ping to their remote workstation. Unfortunately this causes VOIP calls to have a LOT of lag (probably about 1000ms latency or more) and is generally not great. Before I send out another smartphone, I wanted to do a little bit of digging to see if there are better remote audio solutions available.\n When doing some research I found that some people were experimenting with to passing through a USB audio device, but I can't seem to find a way to do this on a Windows 11 Pro workstation - I enabled the group policy option for RemoteFX USB passthrough on my client PC but I still can't seem to find this as an option.\n Other people have suggested installing VOIP software on the local machine - but having to flip flop between the local and remote environment sounds really annoying.\n The last thing I've discovered is a tool called sound-over-rdp, but I can't seem to find any feedback as to whether it's a good tool or not. It also is a little bit on the expensive side of things, would rather not drop nearly $3k AUD for 5 users / servers.\n I did also find an open source project called USBIP-Win that allows for USB redirection, but it seems pretty complex. I had a quick look at their github and I'm not quite sure it'd solve my issue to be honest.\n Any suggestions on the best practices from here would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/stephendt  \n [link]   [comments]",

I haven't been able to find solutions that match with this situation as most posts online focus on non-repair related issues.\n The Lenovo technician told me this: It's because the serial number on the motherboard doesn't match with the rest of the laptop. He suggested me that I should reinstall Windows 11, but because it was active when I booted post-repair, I don't think this would work.\n I also found out that there's a BIOS update, along with some other Windows updates that were there for the three weeks I didn't have access to the laptop. But given that the situation I'm in with the Bitlocker Recovery Key is due to a repair and not a software issue, how should I go about this?\n Thank you in advanced for advice! :)\n    submitted by    /u/ViridianWizard  \n [link]   [comments]",

I worked as a mom and pop hardware shop PC repair technician before coming here and was very forthcoming with my skills, knowledge, etc when I interviewed for this role and they hired me.\n It felt like a lucky break and I was so excited to work in a real professional and corporate environment under an IT professional that has been in the biz for almost 30 years. \n This was not what happened.\n My RM set me down and introduced me to a Team I'd be working with for support that i needed and they are based in India so I could come to them with any help I need. 3 weeks later, my RM leaves to UAE as well for an indefinite amount of time. Before he leaves, he gives me the most barebones training ive ever received and basically just told me to watch and learn and ill pick up everything i need that way. Every time I need access to something or to help someone out, I have to reach out to someone on my Team in India to grant access, monitor bandwidth, configure DNS, you name it, I pretty much have to ask someone to assist me because either I don't have the tools, or the understanding. Maybe it's a good thing as I don't know exactly what to do with the tools in the first place.\n Is this normal to be hired in like this and feel totally out of place and just constantly questioning if I'm doing a good job?

We do not use O365 (we are on GSuite) but we do want to get Intune working to manage Windows devices. Our main requirements are to get Autopilot working so that we can just mail new users laptops without having to image, use Intune to manage endpoint policies, and use Intune to manage updates (especially feature updates) for older versions of Windows 10.\n When I researched this previously the \"EMS E3 (Enterprise Mobility + Security E3\" license was supposedly the best option to get all of this. Our VAR seems to think, however, that this does NOT include Autopilot or the ability to push feature updates. Does anyone know if it does or does not? We would likely not use the security features (currently on Crowdstrike) unless it integrates well with our other security products. We are a non-profit so we are hoping we qualify for the non-profit licensing discount but our VAR also thinks that we may not (no idea why they think this). \n We were also recommended to use this 3rd party site which also makes it seem like EMS E3 does not include Autopilot. However other people have told me that it does and that this site is incorrect. \n https://m365maps.com/files/Microsoft-365-Enterprise-Landscape.htm\n edit: This link makes it sound like EMS E3 MIGHT be all we need?

If you try to establish a connection to (business) OneDrive or SharePoint, it'll just stall out and do nothing, not even apprising you of the issue.\n That is, unless your 365 tenant still has the SharePoint policy which controls legacy access on \"Allow,\" then it works fine. But we don't and don't want to revert that setting just for this.\n Adobe is obviously a major company with the resources to have upgraded their products for this a long time ago--many others already have, including much smaller companies like Foxit. This leads me to wonder if it's purposeful: maybe they want you to use the Adobe Cloud instead of SharePoint.\n There's a sad little UserVoice entry about this with 8 votes currently (I think more reflective of the obscurity of what the problem is, perhaps combined with many tenants still not going to modern yet, than lack of interest):\n https://acrobat.uservoice.com/forums/926557-adobe-acrobat-for-sharepoint-onedrive/suggestions/45249598-add-support-for-modern-authentication\n    submitted by    /u/rpodric  \n [link]   [comments]",

There was no change in the configuration. Shares from the server itself are still accessible by others.

I reach out to the CSM, and then magically within a few hours I have a support engineer beating down my digital door asking when we can schedule a phone call. The phone call takes place, I give them what they need, they say that they will get back to me. 2 days goes by with not a peep from them. Re-engage the CSM, and the cycle repeats. \n With our firewall vendor, it takes an average of 8 days for a resolution, even the most simple of changes. I've brought this up to management multiple times and they say that we don't have the manpower right now to take our firewall duties in house nor do we have the manpower to research and negotiate a contract with a different firewall management company.\n I don't know if it's a staffing shortage or just poor management, but this is incredibly frustrating because I have management at my company asking why these issues aren't resolved yet and I hate shrugging my shoulders and telling them that I'm in a perpetual state of waiting for support to get their act together but it's the truth.\n    submitted by    /u/_twokoolfourskool2_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can say that and other IT admins will hopefully respect that. \n Yet it just feels when you see a leaver asking you about the process of keeping my IT business assets when I leave it's like do we owe you that. It's not yours. It's the businesses. Yes you have a phone number that's the businesses line number. Your iPhone the one that says property of XYZ.com is again a business asset. Also the laptop which is a corp laptop with a corp image on it with corp licensing on it is not yours they still seem to think it's ok to ask for this when they leave like it's a sentimental thing ? \n Then it comes your manager asks you to make sure they transition you off everything and give them the guidance you should of done this and that. In work hours when you have other actual jobs work related jobs to be doing. \n Why do businesses not stand up and have a stern stance on this.

Keep in mind this is my first step up from IT specialist to sys admin so bear with me OGs.\n We are operating on a 2016 Windows Server and this holds all of our drives. The business is about 100 people. In November, I installed the .NET Framework 4.8(KB5020614) and the Update for Windows Server 2016(KB5019964). I have had non-stop issues with connectivity to the drives ever since. The errors string from \"local device name is already in use,\" to \"Target name is incorrect.\"\n I have found limited success in doing ipconfig/release-renew-flushdns. It's usually a 50-50 chance that the issue resolves after that. If I use the IP address to the server in the file explorer address bar, it immediately pulls up; its the complete opposite when I try to call it by its name \\\\server1\\. I've checked the DNS and DHCP to see if they're properly communicating and there seems to be nothing wrong(not ruling them out).\n As recent as yesterday, I have started to force our user computers to use a different IP through the IPv4 in adapter options. For instance, I'll make 192.168.8.113 go to 192.168.8.204. I have found complete success with this and the most odd part is I can set the user machine back to automatically grabbing an IP address which will revert it to 192.168.8.113 and it instantly works. \n It seems like I'm forcing the previous session to end and renewing the lease on the DHCP ??? I don't know but I'm open to all suggestions as my boss(the owner) grows in irritation. \n Thanks ahead of time.\n    submitted by    /u/Zelliion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now we have a new system that will run \"dockerized\", that environement is a composition of 7-8 containers that run together to deliver that service (mysql, redis, nginx and some other images).\n How do you deal with that \"in general\" regarding the management of such stuff?\n Do you create a bunch of linux hosts virtualised inside hyper-V and manage them with some container orchestrator (any tips - can be commercially backed and cost something)? So, something like a virtualized cluster?\n Do you build something completely \"aside\" like a bunch of synlogy nas with docker support? or even a complete new hardware cluster?\n Using windows servers for docker stuff does not make sense imho. \n Thanks for any recommendation :)\n    submitted by    /u/funkyferdy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ok so while typing what was going to be the original post this has started working, but for no apparent reason. This has now gone from a request for help to a quest of understanding.\n So a while ago I was doing some fiddling with a client Synology, had created a new backup folder, unmapped the old one, attempted to remap the new one. \"Invalid Password\". Ok sure, that happens sometimes, thing is I didn't actually need the drive to be mapped as the backup software (backup assist) could see the location and access it with the given details so I figured it'd be fine. Decided to fix mapping the drive after the next scheduled reboot.\n Everything was not fine, turns out that despite being able to see and access the NAS, when attempting to actually perform the backup task it would fail as \"unable to access the network location\". Keep in mind, all I have done is make a new 2023 subfolder in the backup folder (we're MSP, they like it that way) and try to map it back after removing the 2022 folder.\n So I make a new user, try to map it with that, nope, same thing. Despite being able to log into the device with these same creds that Windows doesn't like.\n After that I restart things, bash my head against the wall a bit, find some other people who had similar problems that came about as the result of a setting change (none of mine have, double and triple checked), so I come here, begin writing my post, and mid way through I decide to try to map it one more time.\n It fucking works.\n And I haven't even done anything. I didn't even have to type the details in, it just immediately worked and mapped it like there'd never even been a problem.\n    submitted by    /u/TheKingOfSpite  \n [link]   [comments]",

This particular user has some of our customer files SharePoint doc libraries synced with OneDrive to his local machine.\n If while we are on the call, his password is changed, SharePoint and files access removed, doesnt this take some time to sync? I believe the last time I removed some ones Azure files access, they had it for several more hours. Is this the same for Sharepoint? We do have \"Automate\" installed on his machine, so I could force a reboot, but if he is not on the VPN at the time, the password might not sync and still be cached. I did some research and saw there is a registry item that can be changed.\n Although I could wipe the machine with Intune, I do want to be able to go through the machine and make sure he does not have local files that need moved to a project directory on the network. \n Will a password change instantly cut his access on his phone as well, or do I need to revoke those tokens as well?\n I would appreciate any suggestions to make this as streamlined as possible, its not something we are particularly excited about having to do, but they are leaving us no choice.\n    submitted by    /u/eld101  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So this may be a stupid question and maybe I'm reading too much into it, but here's where I'm unsure:\n I deal with Cybersecurity Insurance Questionnaires for our clients. A lot of times it'll ask if server databases are encrypted at-rest, and from my understanding and from what tools we use, this is basically asking \"Is Bitlocker enabled on server data disks?\" and the answer is typically No.\n However now I have this question for a client who's servers are all Azure VMs. These do not have Azure Disk Encryption enabled, which from my (potentially limited) understanding, means Bitlocker is not enabled on the virtual disk. However, Azure VMs by default live on Microsoft's data centers, and the physical disks in those data centers have server-side encryption (SSE) \n So my question is... does this count for at-rest encryption as far as this cybersecurity questionnaire is concerned? Because from my (again, probably limited) understanding, at-rest encryption is intended to protect against someone getting access to the physical disk, and sure this would prevent it if someone broke into the Microsoft data center and somehow stole the disk this VM lived on so that would seem to make the answer to the question \"Yes\" in the most technical sense. But if someone gained access to the Azure environment & stole the VHD file, then Bitlocker isn't enabled on that file and could presumably read all the contents then it's like... was at-rest encryption really even on? Is at-rest encryption explicitly a protection against physical data breaches? Or should at-rest encryption include VM disk encryption when the server in question is a VM?\n Or maybe I'm thinking too hard about this?\n    submitted by    /u/The0  \n [link]   [comments]",

The remote connection cannot be started.\"\n Interestingly, some users still worked fine however, and these were users sat next to each other in the same office.\n Now, we've seen issues where the signature can throw off the RDP file sometimes so we edited the file in notepad and removed both the \"signscope:s:\" and \"signature:s:\" values, this allowed it to work, obviously this bypasses the whole \"digitally signed\" part of the file.\n We checked the usual before this, ensuring all the certificates were valid etc. (they were) and no weird updates had been applied to clients or the relevant servers (they hadn't) so we deployed this file to affected users.\n However, we then got a report from another customer with the same issue, then a third reported the issue. Our initial thought being some sort of CA issue, but two of these customers used Sectigo, the other was R5/GlobalSign so that ruled that idea out.\n We couldn't find a reason for this so eventually just had to remove those two lines from the files and it seemed to resolve the issue. A cursory glance around the Internet only really flagged this issue when using self signed certs, we aren't.\n Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! At the moment we have only seen this at 3 (maybe 4) customers but obviously don't want to see this get more widespread!\n As an additional point, the RDP file \"breaks\" regardless of where it's used from, so it doesn't look to be the originating network that's the issue.\n    submitted by    /u/Delodien  \n [link]   [comments]",

But how do you handle a lost or broken key on accounts that you do not have full administrative control over, such as a social media account? If you require your staff to register a backup key, does that not create other issues (my knee-jerk reaction is end users would end up carrying the backup with them so they can always have it to register both at once, or would forget to bring in the backup key so it never gets registered, both of which defeats the purpose of the backup key) or do you require that the IT department register additional keys on MFA setup?\n Am I overlooking something obvious, or is this just something that sysadmins just deal with? It would seem to me that the best way of solving this would be if a YubiKey/similar product could be \"paired\" so that one key could register both itself and a cold backup key that is stored elsewhere (held by IT in a corporate use case) without having to carry both.\n Thank you for any insight,\n    submitted by    /u/Party-Cook-1666  \n [link]   [comments]",

Like all good sysadmins I did my google searching forever on this and there is not one thing (rebuild profile, reinstall Office, repair OST, rebuild OST, turn off bad add-ins that do nothing but slow you down, reset the navpane, everything) that hasn't worked. The ONLY thing that works is once it gets into that state, a quick reboot fixes it for another 4 hours. I keep saying 4 hours because it's been close to clockwork when it happens 4-5 hours later.\n Talk about an annoying piece of crap. We all can have our rants on crappy MSFT software updates and programming. However, I have had a few other users with the new version of Outlook with similar issues, but the beforementioned methods have worked (but it eats up precious time none of us have). The difference with my users is they are all Windows 10, and I was the idiot that was smart enough to upgrade to Windows 11.\n Any thoughts? Other than the IT guy is an idiot (I hate that I can't even figure out my own stupid issue)?

I'd just like to know if anyone else has had subpar performance for Dialpad in Aus or NZ?\n Note) Did an Ookla speed test with an end user today reporting issues and they 278 down 114 up with 4ms to server, so I'm thinking very unlikely an issue on our side.\n    submitted by    /u/hvytrdtrnngtffndngn  \n [link]   [comments]",

But that rarely happens since they don't go to their secretaries first when something goes wrong.\n Part of us is like, \"eh, they are at the top of the pyramid.. whatever.. just help them then open a ticket for them and move on.\" Another part of us is like \"no, they need to follow IT policy like everyone else!\"\n Just curious if this is an issue for the companies you work for?

Because these lists are on-prem, and devices are in Azure, there’s not much users can do to manage these lists. I’m curious as to how you handle this on your end. I was thinking about possibly migrating these groups into Azure, but not too sure on any repercussions of that change. I also thought about a 3rd party tool, but it may not be worth it, if there is something I can do with what I already have. Appreciate any thoughts or comments you may have.

I did some more monitoring and saw that the cpu queue is sometimes a bit to high (about 5 - 10 for a 16 core VM).\n So i like to spread the user over more servers and read about the sizing guide from microsoft. Our users working with the office programs, ERP System and doing normal surfing and research via MS Edge and Google Chrome. Due to this workload i would say that its categorized in the heavy work load / power users.\n For that Microsoft says i should use 4 vCPU and about 8 GB RAM per User. Thats beeing said for our about 140 User, i shoud have about 144 vCPUs and 1 TB RAM. Thats seems quite high for me. Usally i dont provision 1:1 CPU ratio. \n Microsoft also say, i should not provision more then 2 users per vCPU. Thats still 72 vCPUs for all. Due to the workload i dont get a good ratio about real threats and vCPU (on Hyper-V). \n I'm quite curios about other RDS farms with about the same workload. I read some threats on the internet where 20 Users are on a quad core system with 16 GB RAM. Other wrote that they have 8 Core, 32 GB RAM but just provision it to 4 users.

The reason: The effort to configure the firewall is too great or the Windows firewall would be pointless anyway. I would now like to change this situation and gradually activate the firewall on all servers. The problem is also that the necessary IPs and ports are hardly or not at all documented.\n ​\n Now my question: How would you proceed to achieve this goal? Simply switching on the firewall would instantaneously paralyse most servers. Firewall\n My idea would be: First document the active connections with netstat and write corresponding rules, then activate the firewall with Allow-Any for a certain time and then study the log to find more IPs and ports.\n ​\n I am curious about your suggestions and thank you in advance for your ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/admin_mt  \n [link]   [comments]",

We offer some apps (including M365) as remote apps through RDS. We use Windows Server 2012 R2 (yea yea i know, we are upgrading asap)\n For the people saying, why don't use the local M365 apps. Our back-office system only works good on TS-systems and needs Outlook and word for some functionality. \n The issue is, when people open attachement in this outlook app or from our back-office system. The outlook 'home' page (The page with inbox and all your e-mail) stays as the focused the screen. The openend attachement or e-mail from our back-office system stays behind that outlook screen until you open it from the taskbar. \n I am getting the feeling it is an Server 2012 R2 issue or a remote app issue. When we used RDS with desktop for our users, they didn't have this issue but we used Office 2010 then and Exchange 2013.\n Thanks in advance,\n Kind regards,\n Roy de Jonge\n p.s.

          "description": "So we have this guy that works... \"works\"... with us and we've noticed an increase in the frequency that we see Netflix up on his computer, through his browser. Now, we don't have a problem with someone pulling up Netflix while they work for background noise, if it helps them get the work done more efficiently, I myself have YouTube videos up while I'm working, it helps me concentrate and get my work done, and my boss doesn't have a problem with it. The major issue is that this guy doesn't really do anything, just sits on Yahoo! all day and watches Netflix. So we were thinking, we should block Netflix on his computer. The only problem is, Netflix has thousands of IP addresses, and trying to block, or redirect, based on IP would take a long time, time that we don't really have.\n So my question is this... does anyone know of an effective way to block Netflix on a domain computer, and only that domain computer? Blocking the site on the network completely is not an option, based on the nature of our work environment, so we need it to be just for one computer. We also do not want him to know that we actively blocked it, he has a bad temper and flies off the handle when things like this are brought up, and retaliation is a real fear, so a redirect to localhost is preferred. If it's not possible, I get it, but we need him to not be on Netflix all day.\n NOTE: 1.) My boss can't fire him, he's been trying. 2.) He's tried talking to him about things like this before, it doesn't work. 3.) HR has been ineffective at helping the situation, their advice as \"All you can do is talk to him.\"\n    submitted by    /u/RicketyGaming  \n [link]   [comments]",

They had 2 external drives plugged into the computer for backing up but apparently the last time anything was done on the drives was back in 2020 and there weren't even any backups. Is there anyway to recover the SSD without formatting or is it a total loss? The company does not have IT, they call us whenever there's an issue and we offered to do cloud backups a while back but they're cheap and refused saying they'd do it on their own.\n Update: the computer was windows 10 but they were running server 2019 on Hyper V.

I found out that if I dont want the lowest tier office laptop, I am gonna pay around 700-800 € (which is my budget). For this price, I can find some lower tier gaming laptops (10- 11th gen intel, rtx 3050, 144 Hz displays which I find very comfortable to work with). \n Thats where my dilemma starts, would you rather buy a mid tier office laptop, but not have the ability to use it for entertainment, or aim for lower tier gaming laptop which may have some disadvatages ( overheating, weight, noise)? \n My best options I found on the web so far:\n Office laptops: DELL Latitude 15-3520, ASUS Vivobook 15X OLED X1503ZA-MA437W,\n Gaming laptops: MSI GF63 Thin 11SC, Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15IHU6 Shadow Black \n All of these are approximately 800€ (you can suggest different).

I work for, they are largely a windows shop and while they have been generous to provide admin rights on developer machine. Basically their development process is very manual and limited automation.\n So trying to get automation in is rather challenging due to the firewall. EG: I cannot use terraform as trying to use it from the terminal fails due to the proxy settings. Similar for minikube or pulling from the docker hub. In December there was some screw up because I could actually pull docker containers from hub.docker.com. When speaking to the infosec people they keep telling me we need static IP's so that they can allow those sites. However trying to find out who can assign static IP's just results in the run around. \n Surely there is a way with windows group policies to allow developers in that policy to get access to terraform/npm/docker?\n I think the firewall solution is from fortinet if that helps with suggestions.\n ​\n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Majestic-Extension94  \n [link]   [comments]",

But now I want to ask about aftermaths of boot-repair. So, my system was working like this before:\n  \nUbuntu with Grub\n Windows on hdd\n  \nSo what I did is I unplugged every drive, I installed Windows on new m2 ssd, connected old hdd (where my old windows was located), transfered all data and formatted hdd so it's now just a storage for windows. Then I connected ssd with my ubuntu and run boot-repair from my usb flash. After that grub got fixed and I can choose between new Windows and Ubuntu, and it's all working.\n But one thing that bothers me is that there's still old Windows left on grub menu, even tho I formatted old hdd with Windows. Also in UEFI there were added more options to boot from, like ubuntu (m2 ssd) and ubuntu (hdd) even tho ubuntu is not installed there at all. I have the logs from boot-repair saved, if they're safe to share, I can share them. Also I can screenshot my partitions if it's needed, just tell me what to run, I'm not a pro in such things, and it seems like no-one in other communties can help me (I asked this question many times), so please don't delete the question, because last time I asked here something, it got deleted even tho it didn't violate any rules, but I was lucky enough to get the answer before it got deleted, so I came here again, as my last hope, not trying to violate anything.\n My question is, should I be worried about something? Or it's not of a big deal and I can forget about it? It also says when I'm booting to Ubuntu \"failed to set APST feature\" and something starts going on, and eventually it loads after a little time and works fine, new Windows on m2 ssd works fine too.\n    submitted by    /u/Zakepanka  \n [link]   [comments]",

While designing and implementing systems is fun, the detective work appeals to my inner curiosity.\n Much of my research around getting started in this field suggests learning an OS in-and-out, a close-second is learning a scripting language. Because I work in a Windows environment, it's sensible to start with Windows and PowerShell. This makes sense, but I don't know how to go about tackling the former. \n There are some books, like Powershell for SysAdmins, that can teach me Windows administration through PowerShell--hitting two birds with one stone. Is this advisable or should I begin by learning Windows core processes and its other components independently of PowerShell so I don't get overwhelmed?\n I fear I'm overthinking this, and I'd welcome that constructive criticism if that's what's going on. Helping me develop this area of my roadmap would be much appreciated. Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/4alloween  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you have any idea how to fix it or even another way of doing things, I'd appreciate your advice.\n To preface, our public folders contain mailbox enabled folders that have their own aliases that external users e-mail regularly. Our current setup allows only users assigned a public folders role to have access to see the public folders as its own entity under folders in their Outlook client. No one else sees it. For the migration, we are using BitTitan.\n In Office 365, I set up the public folder and using BitTitan, migrated the stuff over. I set explicit permissions using the public folder GUI in the Exchange admin center. However, everyone is seeing the public folders as if it's a shared mailbox shared with everyone. I've found out how to limit unauthorized users from accessing the content, but the public folder mailbox remains. Any ideas of how to get rid of the mapping entirely for certain users?\n    submitted by    /u/Powerful_Hospital_91  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hands down, the most incompetent group of \"technicians\" I've encountered in ~20 years of working in IT.\n Our ticket was escalated to the higher tier of support and they initially attempted to help. But once none of their recommendations worked, they said \"Unfortunately your product version is no longer supported.\"\n I replied saying that can't possibly be true, as you all are still actively selling the product. So they backtrack and ask, \"May I know proof of purchase?\" To which I responded that we no longer have the receipt. But sent them the activation key, the email used to originally purchase the software, and a screenshot logged into said account on our registered products page.\n From here, they send, \"Another user may be able to help you get an answer in one of the forums\" to which they provide a link that just goes to their parent company's main page with no forums mentioned anywhere.\n So I inform them of this... and the response? \"May I know proof of purchase\" - same exact guy I have been speaking to this whole time. \n I open a second ticket in an attempt to get a different technician. Specifically ask not to get \"Mr. XYZ\" and I end up back with him anyways. We have the exact same conversation mentioned above and this is a never ending loop. We got so frustrated we decided to say fuck that software and bought a similar one from a different vendor.\n TL:DR - Corel bought Roxio. Their support sucks dick for gas money, and then rides their bike.\n    submitted by    /u/grapplerman  \n [link]   [comments]",

A lot of it is emails going to multiple people because of how teams and distribution groups are setup.\n I have sent out training to users on how to create rules and manage the volume of mail with retention policies and even showing them how they can bulk delete them selves online, but it seems to be getting too much and users aren't following direction. We have tried shared mailboxes for some teams, but due to the volume of mail and people accessing it, it tends to crash outlook and does more harm then good. \n I have a meeting with Front's technical team, just want to know if anyone has tried to make the transition to a software like this and is there anything I am looking over? And or how have you overcome the problem of high volumes of email?\n Concerns I have:\n  \nWe have around 1000 distribution groups which we would have to use Microsoft's SMTP settings for each distribution group and would be a manual setup for each. The other option is using Front and their servers and updating our SPF/DKIM records, though then Microsoft will then not have a record of those outbound emails.\n Adds another point of failure for email, as now if Front goes down everything will be forwarded to their system.\n Learning curve for end users, we would have to switch around 80% of our company to this.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/IT_Guy_101  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to extend my apologies for potentially wasting your time, but I felt it was important to reach out and share my recent experience.\n Recently, I was working on our ESXi cluster and FC Fabric to add another storage system.\n I had to reload the FC zone, and despite knowing that the other switch should carry the load, the system briefly halted, causing me great concern. My heart raced as I feared the worst, but fortunately, the failover worked as expected.\n I understand that moments like these can be incredibly stressful and can take a toll on one's mental and emotional well-being. I empathize with anyone who has experienced similar situations and want you to know that you are not alone.

Things have evolved a little and I am certain the lockouts are coming from Exchange, but I have looked through every Exchange/IIS log I can find and I am unable to find corresponding attempts to access these users' mailboxes. \n I finally enlisted Microsoft Support after reaching my wits end with this issue and dropped the $500 on a ticket. After a day and a half of intermittently working with them to investigate the issue, they came to the conclusion that...the Exchange server was the source of the lockouts...\n They admitted that I knew that when I submitted the ticket, so they told me they were going to refund the cost of the ticket, but we need to reach out to premier support for a RCA (root cause analysis) as they had reached their limitations in assisting us (they didn't even get as far along as I did in my own investigating...). \n So I reached out to premier support. Where I'm told you need a premier support contract to get support from them. That contract, I am told, starts at $53,000. $53,000 is what it would cost us to get support from Microsoft, on a Microsoft product, that we already pay heavily for for the \"privilege\" of using...\n Does this align with anybody else's experience?

Your expertise and kind words helped me take action and improve my situation. Some of you even reached out to me in private to help me out with writing a CV, Configuring the network, fixing the VMware issues and so on, so i feel like i owe you guys an update. \n I compiled all the evidence I had of rude and stressful interactions with users and wrote out my account of the situation from memory. Then, I printed everything out and went to speak with my workplace leadership. I was acutally shaking so much you could hear the paper move LMAO, but I explained in detail how a certain boss treated me, including how he asked me to break the law to get something he wanted (I had email evidence), and how much it stressed me out when he would be angry that i didn't follow through. I also explained how this workload was too much for one person to carry, and the person I spoke with took me seriously, and I was put on sick leave with pay until I can see a doctor. They're launching an investigation into that boss starting from the very top, and addressing the rotten workplace culture in a discrete manner.\n I have a doctor's appointment on Monday, and I'll most likely get a mental health sick note to take some time off. As for the job interview I mentioned, it didn't work out because I didn't have some Office 365 Certs :D but at least I have time now to look for something better! Also, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW ULTRA CORPORATE THAT PLACE WAS, It almot felt like a cult where everyone was one \"giant happy family\"! \n Once again, thank you all for your support and advice. I truly appreciate it and feel like I've played my cards right to improve my situation.\n    submitted by    /u/Voyagerlol  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some said Yes by confining the scope of the analysis to the drives.\n Others pointed out that a single RAID controller or power supply failure would defeat the HA nature of the RAID drives.\n Wikipedia states:\n There are three principles of systems design in reliability engineering which can help achieve high availability.\n Elimination of single points of failure. This means adding or building redundancy into the system so that failure of a component does not mean failure of the entire system. Reliable crossover. In redundant systems, the crossover point itself tends to become a single point of failure. Reliable systems must provide for reliable crossover. Detection of failures as they occur. If the two principles above are observed, then a user may never see a failure – but the maintenance activity must. ....\n It strikes me that there is an important distinction between having some redundant components and having no single point of failure.\n I can see that RAID alone has good capacity to improve availability, but I wouldn’t say RAID is HA.

Currently all RDSH Servers are VMs Virtualized using Hyper-V as the Hypervisor.\n By the looks of it I need a Enterprise NVidia GPU that is compatible with the Server (Dell PowerEdge R640 for example can support an NVIDIA T4 GPU).\n However reading online, Microsoft have removed vGPU / RemoteFX Support from Windows Server 2016 Build 1084. So this is a no go.\n I think I need the following:\n > An Enterprise Driver License from NVidia\n > A physical GPU installed in a Server, for example the NVIDIA T4\n > A Hypervisor that supports vGPU\n Looking on the NVidia Website, it looks like this is only supported using the following Hypervisors:\n > VMWare vSphere\n > Citrix Hypervisor 8.4\n Both of the above Hypervisors are incredibly expensive in terms of licensing. If I use what I currently have (Hyper-V - Server 2019) this would not allow vGPU or Remote FX, but would only allow physical mapping, so 1 x Physical GPU directly mapped using DDA to the Guest VM RDSH.\n Am I missing something here, how are other enterprises adding Shared vGPUs to their Virtualised RDSH VMs to improve performance?

I wanted to alert other candidates about the red flags I found during the hiring process. However, the company somehow managed to trace the review back to me, and I have no idea how they did it.\n To be honest, I'm not even scared or intimidated that they found out it was me behind the review. I've been job searching since I got laid off, and I don't care about burning bridges at this point. Companies already burn bridges with their bad treatment and terrible hiring processes, treating employees and job candidates as disposable assets.\n The hiring manager even sent me an email to schedule a call with him to clarify some of the points I made in my review and to see if there's a job opportunity for me. But I've been burned by corporate so many times that I have serious trust issues with companies. At this point in my life, I don't believe anything that comes from them, especially if they start dangling carrots in front of me.\n I admit, I'm curious to know how they traced the review back to me, but I'm not willing to risk my privacy to find out. I also want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with Glassdoor reviews being traced back to them. What are your thoughts on this situation? Should I take the call from the hiring manager, or is it not worth my time?\n I'm open to any honest feedback and opinions.

What I'm looking to better understand is at what point does administration become engineering. Based on my experience the line is thin and dependent on the organization that you work for. The way I've reasoned this out in my head in the past is that administration is mainly monitoring/maintaining while engineering tends to be more focused on the planning/creation/building of infrastructure.\n It appears that a lot of employers tend to blur these lines. Though it could just be skewed perspective based on my experience.

I was looking at rsynch and it has a block level synch option, would that possibly work? \n My main concerns are if the full RMAN dumps would trigger rsynch to send a full each time this won't work, but if it's smart enough to only send changed blocks each night this should be workable. The initial full will be the worst in terms of host impact and time, we will seed it locally if possible.\n Are there better tools for this type of host based copy approach? DBAs do not want a formal agent-based backup app, I understand there are better approaches.

In principle I could do all of that programmatically within the application, and simply distribute it as a standalone exe. Would an MSI/App-V/MSIX container be preferable to that?

They started having downtime on Friday, December 2nd at 2 AM and by 6 AM on Saturday had revealed that they experienced a security incident. So I immediately switched off onto a CPanel account that I have just to get my email back up and running (it was just one email address). I finally got access to the restore of my PST file. So what I have is the following at this point: \n  \nAn 86 GB PST file with email from 2018 to December 2nd, 2022.\n Emails form December 3rd through today that I use WHM/Cpanel to host. It's Maildir format if that helps. I use Thunderbird to check it.\n  \nWhat I'd like to wind up with is getting onto Office 365 and import the PST file. That should be straightforward. However, how can I take the email from December 3rd until now and get that into Office 365? Perhaps I could setup a separate Outlook account with IMAP that pulls from my CPanel mail account and then just drag the emails from IMAP into my new Office 365 account?\n Or does anyone else have a suggestion on how I could accomplish this?\n Thanks,\n John\n    submitted by    /u/geo1999  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have three main offices and a few satellite offices all connected through Meraki VPN tunnels. We have just over 400 employees/contractors.\n On-Site I have two Dell SAN’s, one for production and one for on-site backup. Seven ESXi hosts and ~33 Cisco switches. Cisco CUCM VoIP system and ~90 VM’s. A Synology for off-site backup.\n In the two other offices I have Dell R series servers, one for back up and one for production.\n Now down to the “meat and potatoes”. I do it all from on-boarding to off-boarding to keeping all the hosts, VM’s, switches and other hardware updated. I babysit employees/contractors everyday with the stupid things you read on here every day. I work 60-80 hours a week. In 2022 I worked every holiday there was. I used 7 hours of PTO time the whole year. I’m 59 years old and I’m tired. The kind of tired you can’t sleep off. (what is sleep?)\n Management refuses to let me hire someone experienced to help. (they let me hire a 17 y/o intern about a year ago) but he didn’t last.\n I make a little over $100K with a $13K bonus in 2022. There’s a ton more but that’s the gist of it.\n Opinions? Comments?

(pgpwde --add-bypass --disk 0 --count 6 --aa)\n Copies SED reflect drivers to needed folder for use during upgrade\n Create variable OSDSetupAdditionalUpgradeOptions to include the above reflect drivers\n Upgrade to newer version of Windows 10\n Restart computer\n Re-register the SED password filter\n Disable SED bypass (pgpwde --remove-bypass --aa)\n Reboot\n Decrypt SED encrypted drive (pgpwde --decrypt --disk 0 --aa --all)\n Uninstall SED\n The sequence goes on, but the above is the pertinent bits.\n  \nThe issue I'm having is that the \"pgpwde --remove-bypass -aa\" command is failing after the upgrade.\n The error I'm getting is -11977 Improper Initialization, which I can only find one reference when Googling, which is: https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=f100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427&CommunityKey=8deae12f-88a6-4d88-9186-231c4ca171d7&tab=digestviewer#bmf100f24b-584e-458e-aae0-0e832e91c427\n Which references Linux.\n The removal of the bypass only fails before a user logs in. Once a user has logged onto the machine, and back off again, then the bypass can be removed.\n So, my thought process is that, perhaps, SED isn't sully started when Windows starts, resulting in a weird state where the commands won't run until SED finishes starting, but I'm not sure SED's underlying mechanics enough to remediate this.\n It's also an older version of SED, like 10.4 or something.\n    submitted by    /u/Nakatomi2010  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even though im still always doing things.\n I was curious as to if anyone else here has ever done such a good job at a company, that the company felt they were no longer needed because everything always works and there are very few pr minor issues happening?\n I also ask because when i first started my job here, there were fires to put out every day. The question every day was \"what are we fixing today\". And according to staff, this was the norm for many years. They havent had their systems consistantly work for years. \n Over the course of the past 2 years ive been here, i have fixed many problems and was able to make it so people are no longer asking \"what is going to break today\", and they can confidently do their job. However, i have found that i am not doing as much work as i used to now. Half of the day is making sure everything is still working fine, or coming up with new ideas/projects to work on for improvements, and the other half of the day is just studying and researching because there really isnt too much else that i can do. And this is unfortunate because all of that work and research nobody can trace or see that i am doing it, they can only assume. Or for the worse, assume im not doing it.\n I realized that, to the everyday staff worker, i went from always walking around helping people and always being seen, to basically being a hermit who never has to leave his office. I dont think that they will let me go because they do love what i have done, but the anxiety side of me worries that if they dont see me actively doing something, they will think im not doing anything, and given nothing is breaking to fix, im no longer needed.\n    submitted by    /u/CleverKrunk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Previously, our staff users have had a home drive \"U:\" on one of our file servers. We're currently in the process of migrating these over to OneDrive for Business, but for some staff we're finding that after we've migrated them, they are sometimes not seeing all their other network drives in File Explorer on Windows 10.\n We currently map network drives using logon scripts - Group Policy Preferences would not be practical as different users need different combinations of network drives - these scripts are batch files with commands like net use v: \\\\SERVERNAME\\SHARENAME$ /PERSISTENT:NO.\n For the vast majority of users these are working fine but for some reason, intermittently the network drives don't show up in File Explorer. We tried re-running the logon script but that said the drives were already mapped. We went to try mapping the drives using the Map Network Drive wizard in File Explorer, and we found that the wizard could actually see the network drives. This led us to discover that restarting File Explorer made the drives visible.\n We tried setting the EnableLinkedConnections registry entry (e.g. as per this ServerFault post) but this did not help.\n We tried enabling NETLOGON debug logging on computers where the incidents were reported, but the NETLOGON debug log didn't show any obvious causes.\n Can anyone suggest what might be causing this issue and how we can resolve it? Other than having our users restart File Explorer every time their drives go missing?\n    submitted by    /u/danj2k  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I need to come up with a better solution.\n Relying on staff to send new user requests for each new guest and having me to create them and assign them office licenses is just going to be way too cumbersome.\n I need something that will allow guests to login to specific PCs with just access to the web and ms office with minimal intervention from IT.\n Wondering if anyone has been in a similar boat and what they have tried.\n    submitted by    /u/Wello4500  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are looking at getting rid of our Anti-Virus and going with Microsoft Defender which comes standard with M365 E3 and M365 E5. My manager has decided to pitch the idea of going with a mixture of Business Standard and Premium with adding on Exchange Online Plan 2 (For some employees), InTune and Microsoft Defender license ON TOP of the business standard and premium.\n Are there any benefits that the M365 E3/E5 provide over the Business Standard and Premium if we add those extra licenses on top or would it just be smarter to go with the M365 E3 and E5?\n The manager has pitched massive cost savings but doesn't really make sense to go with Business Standard/Premium with the add on licenses opposed to just forking out the extra money for M365 E3 and E5?\n    submitted by    /u/Blitzening  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not advocating hiring a technical person who has crap soft skills btw. \n Is it just that finding someone who is technical and has the above skills is to hard to find in IT?

Basically what a white collar does just with a M365 E3 License. However Microsoft has announced that Office 2016 and below is ending support for M365 Connectivity services - that's where the problem begins.\n Cause: Microsoft announced that Office 2016 will be dismissed with supporting connections to M365-Services like SharePoint and OneDrive. (See: Office versions and connectivity to Microsoft 365 services - Deploy Office | Microsoft Learn )\n Issue: Solution would be easy to convert everybody to M365 licenses but with almost 7500 BCs it will be way too expensive and cannot justified against management to have such an rise of expenses for licensing.\n Idea: Then I though, hey let's enable Viewer Mode for M365 products such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint. They can view but cannot edit them. If they need to edit documents they can use Word Online and we are going to assign them M365 F3. \n But there is the next issue which comes with it:\n They cannot access any network shared files where all the local files are located today. Then they need to manually open OneDrive for Business and Word Online everytime and upload the files which they wanna use, save, download and upload it to the network sahre. This won't work since conflict risk is pretty high at that amount of users.\n This is not a great solution and I am out of ideas since Microsoft does not provide any further information. Before I create a ticket at Microsoft I'd like to ask the community whether you have any ideas and if you may experience the same issue in your company?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Techret  \n [link]   [comments]",

Where I bought dresses I wear in Facebook photos, where I've booked a dinner reservation etc. In addition to this, I keep being subscribed to newsletters I don't remember signing up to. A lot of these required confirmation and the confirmation emails are nowhere to be seen in my inbox \n Other than a public profile picture, all of my socials are incredibly secure and have been for some time due to the ongoing nature of this behaviour. \n I thought maybe my emails were being forwarded but I've found no evidence of this (I use gmail and have multiple accounts). Tonight I was having another look around my gmail settings and I saw that my IMAP is turned on. I dont understand IMAP or POP but my understanding is, IMAP allows my gmail to be synced with a different mailbox and all changes (including deletions) are synced. \n I'm of the belief this is how my stalker is doing it, but as this is an ongoing investigation with the police (there is a court order in place). I want to get any sort of IP information before I just switch it off. \n Is there a way to do this? Am I understanding all of this correctly? Do any of you have any other ideas?

          "description": "I know we all hate those little yellow Post-It notes with passwords, but…\n So this week my childhood best friend’s brother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. He was barely fifty. The family had no idea where to start. They didn’t know if he had a will and, if so, who might be the executor. They didn’t know his financial relationships. They didn’t know his insurance policies. They didn’t know who his lawyer was. He was somewhat secretive, and they were stumped.\n What they did have was a stack of four laptops, ranging from his current laptop to plan older one circa 2004. They brought them to me to see if I could “hack” into them and glean anything that might point them in the right direction. I promised I would do what I could.\n I started with the only one that had a power adapter. I was lucky enough that the default account, “user”, had no password and had admin rights. I logged in, reset the password for his account, and started hunting. I found a few work-related documents and some photos of his kids and not much else.\n Next, I gathered all the old laptop chargers I had around and tried to fit the laptops. No luck. Where is my universal charger? ugh. Anyway, I opened one of the laptops and what comes fluttering out? A single Post-It Note. I though, “Please let this be a password”. We all know that is the main use of these damn yellow sticky papers, right? Well it wasn’t, but it was just as good. It was a list of names and phone numbers. Lawyer. Banker. Investment advisor. Insurance agent. Mortgage broker. The works.\n Anyway, thank God for little yellow notes, but I still need to get into the laptops. Anyone have any recommendations for boot sticks that might permit resetting SAM accounts, mounting file systems, etc? I used to use Trinity Rescue Kit, but that was half a career ago. I am also hoping nothing is encrypted; wish me luck.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/DrunkenGolfer  \n [link]   [comments]",

My job also shifts rapidly from providing level 1-3 tech support along with sys admin tasks. I find myself wanting co-workers to bounce ideas off of, but I don’t have that outlet here. I’m getting the itch to move onto something else, but I’m not sure where I want to land and how to get there.

First problem is keep the access documented which is already in process but apart from that is there’s anything which will help like SSO, where the identity is linked to AD and once their account is made inactive they shouldn’t be able to authenticate.\n I thought of writing a script which talks to AD server and allow/deny login using SSHCMD or something and keep it in every server but in event of AD failure it’d be impossible to login to any server.

Back in the day I had a nice Nagios setup with groundwork open source. I exposed the cgi-bin via a reverse proxy that required client certificates. Installed aNag app on my Android device and had a widget on my phone home screen. Net result was that if I (as an example) dropped a disk from my md-raid, my phone would get an active alert within 5 minutes.\n Now in 2023 I am looking to start fresh and ask for suggestions on a completely new monitoring system that meets that requirement. What will alert me within 5-10 minutes of a failed disk, to my Android phone? Active monitoring only, not something that pushes an email or something, since if that system failed, it could fail quiet. \n All clients to be monitored are Linux and I'm only interested in free and open source tools.

Sev 1 emergency, not yet resolved.\n On Thursday a client's email was suspended due to breaching the terms of service of the incumbent email provider who they were still paying for service that is well below the tier of RackSpace because sales would not insist that a modern email service be used. Sev 1 emergency, not yet resolved. \n I inherited the job of migrating an imap email server to m365 with an expected completion date of Friday whilst being the escalation point for 10 L1 technicians. This went as expected. \n Last night I went home and had a panic attack. Theoretically if I cared enough about the client migration I would be working on all weekend but I don't because we were able to get the old email vendor to re-establish the account until we can migrate, I'm spending time on Indeed, Monster & Dice trying to find a life boat out of this hellhole.\n The point of this post is to never, ever, trust an MSP with your environment past the point of giving them a runbook or utilizing them for L1 helpdesk. Never give them administrator credentials. \n If you ever think about being coerced into working for an MSP stick your hand in a rat trap, remember the pain, and realize that MSP is the hotel California of the IT profession. \n Once you have that stink on you it's hard to get it off.\n    submitted by    /u/Admirable-Ad4097  \n [link]   [comments]",

With Confluent, I can configure all of this with a visual GUI.\n But with RabbitMQ, would I need to be making custom connector scripts? E.g postgres database allows webhook trigger, so I make a cloud (edge) function that connects to RabbitMQ and sends the event.\n Or is there something analogous to Apache Connect but designed for AMQP message brokers like RabbitMQ?\n    submitted by    /u/gintrux  \n [link]   [comments]",

Generally speaking we purchase all devices through Apple Business account so it will already be in the Apple Business Manager but every now and then there’s a need for us (or a client) to purchase directly and the. Add to ABM manually. \n What’s winding me up is how inconsistent this experience is.\n Normally it’s as simple as switch the device on, get to the WiFi part of setup and then if fire up Apple Configurator on another iPhone that’s signed into ABM, it detects this and the new device is added to the ABM. You then need to immediately change the MDM to InTune on ABM and force an InTune to ABM sync before you allow it factory reset. It’s then hit and miss on whether or not the device will get stuck at the “obtaining configuration from org” screen. So it’s already a bit flaky even for orgs where this is about as simple as it can be (single profile for that enrollment method) but “tends” to work. \n That’s annoying but I can live with it. What’s annoying me more is that on some new devices fresh out of the box (and old that are factory reset) they refuse to pair up at the WiFi screen, nothing happens at all. Trying to find information on troubleshooting that aspect seems impossible. Very few people using the iOS Apple Configurator App it seems. \n Posting here in the hopes that someone else has come across the issues above and has any advice on troubleshooting either of them?\n    submitted by    /u/VexedTruly  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everyone in our org has MFA enforced, we have configured recommended Conditional Access policies and we generally follow best practice where we can.\n But it got me thinking, if that laptop had not had a BitLocker Pin (TPM ONLY) or the Pin was weak (or user had written it down on a post-it note in the laptop bag…….) what would the thief been able to access? They wouldn’t have been able to caddy the drive due to TPM but could they have booted off a USB utility tool (Hiren or whatever it is now) and reset the Administrator password and then logged in as local admin and had access to the local user profiles and data?\n If so, is there anyway to mitigate this?

Because it opens possibilities of me doing work and upgrading our fire stations since our it contracts all of that work out. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/FireGuyUSA  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit. I am asking because I saw a few UKG posts here before in searches. \n My multi state grocery store company has used Kronos for a long time now. My new store manager started using UKG to create weekly schedules. So our schedules went from two pages to around eight a week. I am supposed to be able to us UKG Dimensions and see my Kronos punches and schedule. Well I put in the url that my company says to put in the UKG site and app. I can see my Kronos punches fine. But it randomly shows the schedule. Never the current schedule or upcoming, but it will show what it was two weeks ago sometimes. \n What I am wondering is... Is there a box/setting the manager has to have selected while making the UKG schedule to have it show up on the UKG Dimensions website/app? I can find no UKG help board that does not require a sort of membership to even ask them. So I thought I would try here.\n    submitted by    /u/nodakskip  \n [link]   [comments]",

User was not receiving an email from certain email address(it is a distribution list address) in their outlook. So I wanted to forward the email coming to that email address to user's email address. \n To do this we have to change the mailbox in OWA to the distribution list address and set forwarding settings to user's email. But some reason my brain lagged and I forwarded user's email to that address. The user called me next day saying that there are no emails /receiving email in their outlook client/OWA. I immediately knew what I did and disabled the forwarding setting and they were able to receive emails again. But emails during forwarding setting was enabled was not in their mailbox. I checked with our l2 team and they said it impossible to do anything in this case. I also did not check keep a copy during forwarding. \n So not only I did not do my job, I created a task for user where they have to request the sender to send the emails again which is a very troublesome task depending on how many emails they received during that time. I requested user to check if the emails could be sent again yesterday. Or they have to contact the distribution list owner and send their emails back. Now I am waiting for user response and depending on their response I might lose my job. I had a panic attack and still thinking about it. How I could do such a simple mistake.

If anything, it seems like the issue has gotten worse. The only fix that helps temporarily for most systems is to push a in place upgrade task sequence via SCCM. This seems to correct whatever component store/SXS corruption initially, but the problem is it seems like for many systems, the problem resurfaces in a month or two. We've since had two Premier tickets with Microsoft without any identification of a root cause. We have looked for various underlying trends such as build process, PC model, installed features/software, antivirus, etc but have been unable to pin it down. We're still using WSU, but we don't believe the issue is on the update server side. It just seems that at some point these machines get corrupted and no amount of SFC or DISM will fix them. In place repair will fix them but only temporarily. Anybody else deal with similar issues?

My experience at past roles has been varied, usually am told to read documentation, check the backlog & review the ticketing system to get familiar with common issues. I feel like there’s a better way to set myself up for success.\n I have the natural instinct to want to “fix everything“ and jump right in to the backlog to look productive. Is this a good idea or should I spend a few days/weeks understanding the environment? I want to be helpful but I don’t want to come off as a know-it-all who says everything needs to be changed. Also, I’m aware that some organizations want the end solutions but don’t want the pain of change, so it‘s never a simple process. I feel that starting with documentation may be a better start and mapping out how the IT infrastructure is designed, but not sure what’s next before getting in the weeds.\n I want to make a good impression and ramp up quickly. But I don’t want to set an expectation that I will work late because I need work/life balance to be physically & mentally healthy.

It is truly solely IE dependent for other reasons as well. I have established that over the last 4 years since I began here. I, of course sounded the alarm years ago to management repeatably that IE had an expiration date. They began the lengthy project of upgrading to a cloud version roughly a year ago. This project also is folding in two other ERP programs into this upgrade so you can imagine the huge amount of work going into this. We are projected to go live with this in May.\n I missed the announcement from Microsoft that they would be putting an arrow through the heart of Internet Explorer on Valentines day and I am just discovering users that have had it updated. Basically if you try to use IE it automatically redirects to Edge. The previous settings in Edge under settings>default browser\" allowed you to disable the redirect. That is all gone now. I have tried uninstalling all the MS updates on their computers from Feb 14 to date. But none of them seem to give back the capability to use IE. It seems to be the version of Edge 110.0.1587.46 had the options available so that you could stop it from redirecting. Now under version 110.0.1587.89 they are gone. I am trying to find a way to roll this back and possibly stop a major work stoppage for my company.

This isn't ideal as it means that every time a computer runs gpupdate/logs in, it will download that file, and the \"Apply once, do not reapply\" setting doesn't seem to work with \"Replace\".

Mails are neither sent nor recieved. First user reported it on Monday, it was solved with 2 reboots, other user was solved with creating a new profile after the Outlook repair kicked in. But we also have two users where the local Office programs straight up do not work anymore. Word, Excel display the Yellow Warn symbol top right next to the profile pic. Also displaying the \"Account Problem log in again\" and when you click on it, the MS login/MFA windows appears with \"Please wait\" and closes. Sign-In protocols in Azure for the affected users are all successful. Even tried the Outlook repair thingy, which created a new profile, but after that we were not able to add the users account to Outlook. It just fails. For Excel and Word, when you try to open a File from SharePoint in the Desktop App, you get an access-denied error, when you say open it Excel/Word online no problem. According to MS support try to close all Office programs, delete all saved Windows Login Credentials regarding Office and OneDrive.

Bored in my room I did a network scan of the free WIFI they provided. To my horror I could see everyone else's device, even an old server I think they may not have been using anymore that appear to monitor temperatures. I reported this while there and they promptly locked everything down (essentially just turning on WIFI isolation).\n This time I'm on a cruise ship and not brought my Alfa card with me. Not done an nmap scan as I know about the legality of that. But thought running WIFI shark while I'm connected to check my on ship account shouldn't hurt. But noticed loads of MDNS entries at all the other guests devices. All their device names. Surely this shouldn't be visible if they had WIFI isolation on?\n Isn't this a slight security issue or am I making something of nothing because I'm just not understanding the Wireshark trace?\n    submitted by    /u/steviefaux  \n [link]   [comments]",

So hopefully someone here can clarify this for me. \n If you enable retention policy to retain all data indefinitely in M365 via Microsoft 365 Data Lifecycle Management so it applies globally to all M365 apps (exchange, onedrive, sharepoint etc.). What happens if you disable a user account and remove the license?\n - Will the retention policies be applied to users One Drive?\n - Will the retention policies be applied to users emails? I know its not going to create inactive mailbox but can you still search the emails from/to this users via eDiscovery?\n - What happens after 30 days, 60 days or 90 days when the standard Microsoft retention period (outside M365 Data Lifecycle Management) expires? Will the data get deleted or will the retention policy kick in and all data will still be available via eDiscovery?\n The key here is, I dont care about restoring user data, it is more for compliance/legal purposes so as long as their data is searchable and can be found within e-discovery, I am happy.\n I keep getting conflicting messages from few M365 consultants. Some saying you need to delete the account when the license is still intact otherwise retention policy wont kick in. Others are saying it should apply the retention policy setup globally regardless. I dont want to find it the hard way so im just gathering some information here and there while waiting an official answer from M$.\n    submitted by    /u/Willing_Radio932  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just a heads-up: Contrary to chatter on the Internet and Microsoft's own patch notes, I have now confirmed the Secure Boot problem caused by KB5022842 (the February 2023 update for Windows Server 2022) also affects installations other than on VMware.\n I have two machines that are running Server 2022 on bare metal, and that are now refusing to boot due to Secure Boot failure. Other machines appear to be unaffected. The two in question boot after Secure Boot is disabled. Both happen to be older desktop-class computers used for software testing purposes, but I wouldn't put money on this problem only affecting non-server class hardware. (HP EliteDesk 800 G2 Mini, Lenovo M93p Tiny; confirmed that both have the latest firmware available.)\n As others have noted, the problem only shows itself on the second reboot after KB5022842 is installed.\n Be careful! I'd be willing to bet that this problem affects a lot more machines than is currently being reported. Might be worth pre-emptive testing to ensure a panic doesn't ensue if Server 2022 machines need to be restarted in the course of business before this problem is fixed.\n    submitted by    /u/SausageEngine  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Back in the early 2010s when was but a young Sysadmin I went to an architecture office with roughly a dozen users, one switch, Linksys router\\wifi (you know... normal stuff) and We were upgrading them to a POE switch, IP phones, business grade router, new PCs, monitors, the whole network in a box sales job. Everything was pretty normal until I noticed everyone was watching me as I entered \"Bobs office\" just to see my reaction. \n Bob was a special kind of hoarder. Bob liked his paper. Blueprints, White plotter blueprints, Legal sized paper, A4 for some reason, and normal Printer paper. You would think this is normal... and you would be wrong. Bob had this paper from print jobs EVERYWHERE. My words cannot easily describe what I mean by EVERYWHERE. The entire floor.... white paper. Every surface in the office, paper with an avalanche of paper drifting down to the floor... His chair HAD PAPER IN IT with some weird blueprint rolls off the back of the chair making a backrest. I have no idea if his desk was wood or metal because all I saw was paper avalanching off of the 2 sides of the desk not against the wall all the way down to the floor. His monitors were sat on mounds of paper and I had to remove the paper FROM ONTOP OF HIS KEYBOARD!!! Mentally picture fresh powder on a mountain ready for skiing, but replace the snow with paper, this was his entire office, floor to nearly celling. The door would not close because of the 3+ inches of paper on the floor. A normal box of printer paper is 5,000 sheets. His office easily had 500,000 sheets of paper in it, and that may be a conservative estimate because I am over here doing math on how much volume that many sheets of paper would be, and its still not enough. \n When I left the office I played it cool and asked when their last inspection from the Fire Marshall was, the Office Managers face got red and she mumbled something about having \"Bob pick up after himself\".\n    submitted by    /u/stratospaly  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem is the following: \n We got Azure ADDS setup and a AVD server in the environment.\n Each day the users have to sing in to Office, Teams, Onedrive and so on which gets a bit frustrating. Since the server is just AzureAD joined and we have no way to issue hybrid functionality for SSO through an ADDS-server the users get no primary refresh token for SSO after Windows sign in.\n We’ve been investigating how we can overcome this with no luck other then installing an ADDS-server to setup Hybrid join on to hybrid join the AVD-server. We see this as an absolute last resort and would like to make this work with the current setup. \n Have any of you encountered this issue?

Our original set up was completed on a bit of a budget and with zero time, we have an Intel NUC mounted behind a TV with a standard Windows 10 install. We then run a Jabra speaker/mic device under the floor that pops out on top of the desk. We also have a webcam mounted ontop of the TV. \n Joining a meeting is super simple, you enter a pin to unlock the PC, Teams is set to auto open to the calendar upon login and you just click Join on your meeting. Its basically just a standard PC plugged into a TV with an external mic/speaker and webcam.\n We are being asked to look at some teams meeting rooms, which personally I dont think is necessary because the meeting rooms themselves work fine. We are just looking to splash some cash since we have some left over come tax time.\n My main concern is, during meetings no one wants to use their work laptop to share their screen in big presentations. They just put their powerpoint on a network share and run it off the NUC, but they still like to use their personal machines to share their just for quick bits and peices like <4 quick catchups.

After picking the printers department and waiting for a while the phone system said \"We have a faster moving line, if you speak english, press x\". Since English is not a problem, I went there.\n A lady picks up, listens to my problem and says she can't help because they don't deal with printers (red flag #2). Wants to give me a long phone number (unrecognizable to me) and refuses to say which country it belongs to, so how can I use it?

Lately, I have been contemplating a career move to become a software developer. I am looking for advice on whether this move is worth it and what skills or experience I should have to make it happen.\n I have enjoyed my time as a sysadmin, but I am looking for a career that is more fulfilling and flexible. My main goal is to start a business one day as soon as possible, and I am wondering which career path will be more advantageous in this regard. I am starting to enjoy building things, and I am concerned that being a sysadmin will mostly be a tech support role until I get into management. I also can't see how any sysadmin skills will help in business/side hustles until it gets bit enough to need storage and automation. Whereas i feel like building small apps and implementations is possible to do on the side at least if i was to understand development\n I was considering doing a 6 – 10 month bootcamp to help transition, but am also considering other options. What are the key differences between being a sysadmin and a software developer? And most importantly, which career path will be more beneficial for starting a business or work for myself in the future, sysadmin/devops route or software development?\n Lastly, holding me back from making this move is that I have recently landed a role as a lone systems admin and have okay money now (90k AUD) and am enjoying 20% of the work (building/scripting things) and the title. Does it get much better? I am worried about losing the stability and the title of my current role, but I also know that sys admin skills aren’t really transferable to many starting out businesses and side hustles.\n I appreciate any advice or insight.

It took me days and about a dozen calls and I finally got ahold of my account rep and the explanation is my predecessor continued to roll over their lease agreement about 2 years early over and over and we have been with them for 30 years so the previous amount due was also rolled over.\n The summary is that we pay almost 1,000 a month for the next 63 months (the contract was signed only a few months ago).

          "description": "Hi r/sysadmin\n I'm curious how you all go about testing your backups? We have a medium/large sized environment with ~1000 VMs and a few physical servers (most SQL boxes) that we are backing up regularly. 98% Windows, a very select few Linux. However, we don't have a definitive process for testing these backups beyond requested restores that we have to do as people need them.\n Previously, I used Veeam's SureBackup feature to test backups at my previous job, but here we use Commvault and I don't see a similar feature. There does seem to be some sort of backup validation but Commvault's documentation doesn't match what I'm seeing in our console.\n Using Veeam's SureBackup as a model, I started to build out a sandbox network that would mirror our production network, which I could restore VMs into and then run scripts against them to verify they are working. The point I'm more or less stuck at is the \"scripts to verify they are working\" part. For basic Windows boxes I've got a script that checks for running services, and for all the VMs I'm pulling their reported heartbeat status by VMWare, but this is imperfect and doesn't cover some of our more specialized boxes like Exchange or SQL databases. \n Somewhere along the line I think there will be a human element (IE, you are the admin for this server, your server is currently in the sandbox network, login to it and make sure everything works before it gets torn down) but I'd like to automate as much of this process as possible.\n What approach do you take? Is there a feature in Commvault I've missed or a third party tool that solves the problem? Or do you have better ideas on what to check using various scripts and the like?\n    submitted by    /u/Pugway  \n [link]   [comments]",

Latter one wasn't documented at all by it's creator who hase left us in the meantime.\n So around the middle of 2022 I got 4 IGEL licenses to test and that worked pretty fine so far, we decided for the UDP / USB-Version and had no problems occur and the remote assistence etc. helped a lot. I had to put the topic aside for a while now due to other more urgend topics and since we lack staff right now. \n I read somewhere that IGEL reworked their license modell and it's no longer \"Buy once, get 1 year of support and that's it. More support costs but you can use the thin client without support\". Considering the rather dirty enviroment and that our current \"Solution\" produces no monthly/yearly cost (except a device fails after years of usage) I doubt that I'll get the OK for a yearly subscription model.\n So could someone break down the new system or if I understood it wrong and my planned system/setup would still work?\n    submitted by    /u/Interesting-Gear-819  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now that I have started that isn't going to fly and I am going through and taking away privileges. The issue is I have multiple people claiming they need admin permissions but judging by how things were done before I got here I am very hesitant to let anyone keep their privileges. I am leaning towards just taking the access away and see how long it takes for them to even notice but I would also like to have some data as to why I made that decision other than telling the CFO I don't trust him to have admin privileges.\n Is there a report I can run showing the login history for the admin portals specifically?

This naturally results in an increased number of job opportunities for each of us to apply to or be considered for.\n So my advice, waste less of your time, less time of the recruiter, and get actually useful information up-front.\n If you're a recruiter reading this, if you want to waste less of my time, give me these two things up-front.

Then I went and had a talk with the end-user and told them that their department and IT should be on the same team.

Yes, 100x over.\n If you're in a burnout situation, don't let your company/MSP gaslight you into believing that all IT jobs are like that or that all managers/directors are like that.

          "description": "Hello\n We are trying to migrate our on prem Exchange 2016 server to 365, but appear to have hit a roadblock from initial assessment while working with our MSP and I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this issue?\n We have an on prem Exchange 2016, with Business Standard licenses in 365.\n For the last 2-3 years we have been creating user in AD, with sync to 365 and giving them a Business Standard license, which includes a Teams License, and Mailbox.\n The Mailbox doesn't get used in 365, but still gets added as part of enabling the license. We just route all our mail to the on prem instance and connect Outlook to local exchange.\n The Teams license however does get used for scheduling video calls, and also creating the odd group and channels.\n My understanding is that to do a hybrid migration (and enable it), you can't have existing mailboxes in the cloud and those mailboxes need to be deleted.\n I also understand that Teams stores all the chat data in the mailbox as well. \n So do we need to purge all our existing Team Groups in 365, and chat data as well as - then enable hybrid migration - and re-create them to do our migration successfully? \n We also use SharePoint, but I don't believe that will cause any problems to the exchange migration as far as I know.\n Thanks for your help/input.\n    submitted by    /u/cynocation  \n [link]   [comments]",

IT management want to recharge the cost of these licenses to departmental/team cost codes, but we're really struggling with how to keep track of which licenses belong to which team. When a new license is purchased it just goes into one big pool in our Adobe Admin Console, we can allocate it to a new user but there's nothing identifiable about the license itself so no real way to track it as an asset or tag it as owned by a particular team. What would be ideal is a system where we can create groups for different teams and then allocate licenses to each group, I'm just wondering if there's any tool or method that makes this easily possible? Currently all I think to do is have a process of meticulous record keeping in an Excel workbook where we track how many licenses are purchased under each cost code and who is using each license, but this obviously isn't ideal. We need to ensure that licenses are kept within the teams that are paying for them rather than moving around the organisation as people join and leave.\n    submitted by    /u/UpYourGravitas  \n [link]   [comments]",

And while it is absolutely crazy sometimes, I also find myself listening to our customers talk about their jobs and they all seem extremely stressed as well. What I personally like about the MSP life is that it offers diversity:\n  \nDiversity of equipment. Every customer brings a different set of “happy little accidents” to the table and I find that challenge interesting even if I’m not personally the one helping to architect new solutions.\n \nDiversity of focus. If you want to be pigeon-holed or expertise in a specific area, you can. But there are also tons of opportunities for crossover experiences in other areas.\n \nDiversity of customer. Yes you get difficult customers. But you also get some pretty great ones to work alongside. I feel like this is a big benefit and helps to balance the crazy sometimes.\n \nDiversity of ideas. In some ways you’re playing with house money. You can help the customer come up with solutions without having to worry about the dollars and cents. After all, that’s on them to figure out at the end of the day. Obviously you have to be reasonable and help work toward something that benefits everyone involved. But again, that’s a challenge that can be fulfilling.\n \n Those are just a few. And sure, you could read those with the same lenses of a non-MSP job. But isn’t that the point? Why is it such a negative too work at an MSP? Interested to hear from others.\n    submitted by    /u/Outside-Situation-55  \n [link]   [comments]",

The purpose is to control different laptops in a congress centre and all I need is to be able to control the OS. \n Now I've tried Splashtop and Screenconnect and Google Remote all to my frustration. What I like about Teamviewer and Anydesk is that I download 1 app that I can connect from and to. It seems the ones I tried all need a different host and client app(splashtop), need logging in from a browser (google, screenconnect), need to create a secured token per session (screenconnect), or shortkeys can't be used (google). I don't need any bells and whistles since I'm not offering remote support, I just need basic control of my own laptops. A steady connection to about 12 laptops from 3-4 laptops in a directors booth with the possibility of connecting through a code with a possibility to remember/save the connections that I made will do just fine. \n Anyone got a suggestion for a well functioning, really basic and cheaper alternative to Teamviewer/Anydesk?\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/biski9  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m in the broadcast/events world and have had a request come through that has me a bit stumped as to what direction to take.\n A client of mine is looking after an event for a client in the finance sector who has previously had trouble sharing and controlling the digital assets generated for they’re annual conference. Think loads of powerpoint files and video content. Changes and updates are frequently made right up until the presenter walks onstage.\n The assets are generated by the end client’s own internal teams hence the usual solutions of ftp/dropbox/removable media that we would rely on are off the table due to the end client’s security policies.\n My first thought was some hosted storage appliance that we could replicate locally once we get onsite. That way the client’s IT can administer the appliance as they see fit and the local clone/cache will ensure speedy transfers once we get to the pointy end onsite at the event and need to ingest to the show machines. The event is well supported internally and the internal IT teams have been pretty good to work with on similar events in the past as long as we are reasonable in our requests and timescales.\n Any thoughts/reactions from those in the finance sector?\n    submitted by    /u/NotEnoughPi  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been running my own mailservers (I know, it's a challenge) for about 25 years now, fairly successfully (my server's mail gets accepted by the big players, which was a tough task to accomplish over the years, but I finally got Microsoft to clear my IP-addresses, even though they assumed they were part of an entirely bad reputable block of addresses). OK, so here I am, strange how even I question the use of _dmarc every now and then. As a result of weird behavior while migrating from server 1 to server 2 I had to change _dmarc policy to none.\n SPF is correct, DKIM passes for all, but I just want to be certain;\n All mail account users and mail-domains reside behind one hostname and one IPv4 and one IPv6 address. They all send and receive mail using those, SMTP is on that one address. Am I still correct in assuming that setting policy to \"reject\" should be fine then?\n No other servers should try and send mail using any of our system's domain names. If they do, mail should be rejected. None of my users try to use gmail or others to use our email-addresses as aliases, so that problem is non existent. And websites using these domainnames, that may have mail-forms are all using our smtp as well.

Is the system running on the June 2021 version, the June 2022 version, or the November 2022 version - (and eventually, the March 2023 version).\n I have tried using WMIC and DISM queries, but these patches appear to be part of the cumulative monthly updates and aren't individually listed.\n Hoping there is a DLL file version that can be checked... or something I am missing?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/YosemiteSamHouston  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems to meet my requirements as far as a centralized directory, IDP, policies, and support for MacOS/Linux. But I never used this platform before so uncertain how it performs. \n Any feedback is much appreciated. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/EfficientBottle7  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now, I have nothing against Crowdstrike, its a great product, specially if you have Overwatch, however, it lacks on network protection and web filtering, and since this is a must have (in my opinion), the company needs to spend more money on a third party software (like dnsfilter for example).\n Since MS Defender for business is included in their license, I’m inclined to recommend them to make the switch from Crowdstrike to MS Defender for business. Then, with the money that is saved, buying dnsfilter (or other product) for an extra layer of protection , and invest more on security awareness training for the users and still save a lot of money!\n Would you do the same?\n P.S: I know Crowdstrike is a great product and security is not about saving money, but in this case I think we can actually improve their overall security by moving to defender.\n    submitted by    /u/scmdzd  \n [link]   [comments]",

Between shows, the iPads have to be refreshed - wiped of any client data, wallpaper potentially updated (for white-label service), reset settings, update iOS, etc. The app the startup provides on the iPad is distributed via TestFlight and that too has to be updated. I have researched a lot of potential solutions for management software, but haven’t found any of them that specifically mention devices that are leant or rented out (and potential issues around that type of usage that the management software accommodates). Also, looks like none of them can update a TestFlight app. Looking for an affordable solution with intuitive management dashboard/interface. What are some of the best mdm options for this scenario?

Devices are both Mac and Windows, no MDM, AV, domain join etc. all local accounts with admin. \n They're looking to double staff count year on year so I need to get an IdP in place ASAP. For me this has always been AD, however I've never been somewhere this wasn't already in place. What would people here recommend as an IdP for a small company with 1 IT person to manage it?\n Should I just go with AD? (Hybrid) or look at newer stuff like Okta and similar?\n It's a R&D company that's entire existence relies on it's internal research data, that currently any employee can easily walk out the door with. I'm coming from the legal sector where security, compliance and audits were very high priority and I/We had built out several layers to achieve this.

Access to this portal is delegated by us, so nobody can register on his own. If a user wants to access the documentation files (pdf, zip, etc.), he must log in to the portal.\n All files are currently in the data/ folder which is in the root folder of the app that is also exposed by IIS on the internet. The data/ folder is custom made and not part of WP by default. The issue with this situation is that everybody that knows the folder name and filename can directly access it as an anonymous user, which is a security risk (for instance, if our domain is example.com, you can navigate to example.com/data/sample.pdf and download the file without logging in).\n Is there a solution on how to set it up in the web.config or some setting in IIS that you can prevent that behavior? I'd like that only users logged into the WP portal can download the files.\n I thought about moving the data/ folder from the app root folder into a folder that is not directly exposed by IIS, but I believe that WordPress would have huge problems accessing that files.\n Edit: I believe IIS (and not WP) is allowing anonymous users to download the files in the data/ folder as it is exposed to the internet. The general idea I'm currently looking at is how to tell IIS which user is authenticated by WP and which is not?

          "description": "I've been doing SNMP metrics collection for 20 years now with a modified MRTG setup that in addition to storing the data in native RRD files also sends the data to a TSDB which is then fronted by a heavily automated Grafana instance. Now that the world is very slowly moving away from SNMP and towards metrics via REST API and streaming telemetry (Cisco MDT for example) I am starting to research paid metrics collector suites like SolarWinds, PRTG, Zabbix, etc. So far I'm unimpressed with SolarWinds in that it is still using a classic SQL DB for metrics storage instead of a modern TSDB approach. I also don't like the fact that the data is more or less locked in SW - I need to be able to stream a copy of it as close to real time as possible for analysis in other platforms (think a TSDB with ML components). \n Bonus points for netflow collector and analysis discussion too.\n    submitted by    /u/ta271174  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Some time ago I made the switch to another company: less hours, better pay, shorter commute - all really nice things. But what I appreciate the most is how my new manager treats us: I had to do an upgrade for a business critical application (we talk multiple millions in revenue just from this application per week) after hours. It was scheduled to start at 5.45pm, but at 5.30 I got a call \"we need till\" 6pm. Ok, no problem. But you know how it turned out... At 7.30pm I finally could start to shut down the running services. Unfortunately the installation routine runs for up to 60 minutes, even if it fails. So of course this happened multiple times and after some digging around in the log files and doing multiple steps manually that should run automatically, I was finished at around 1.30 in the morning.\n I informed my manager the next day (back at work at 8am) and his response was \"First: Next time just tell them you will not start after the agreed upon time. It's our job to make sure this stuff works, but we are not responsible if they can't finish their work in time. Second: if something like this happens again, feel free to call me for support. I am usually awake till 2am anyways so just give me a call! Third: Go home and sleep - if you work longer hours, just come in later so you can get enough rest\".\n Feeling the support of the people above me and knowing they will stand up for me and help is worth much more than all the things that made me switch jobs in the first place. For the first time in the last two years I enjoy my work again.\n And yes, I did take him by his word the next time something didn't go right: at 10pm I called him. He tried to help me figure it out and at 11 told me \"I don't know what's wrong. You can stop now, I will take over“.\n    submitted by    /u/Craneson  \n [link]   [comments]",

What's that? You want to separate out server roles, keep things more separate, without worrying about re-licensing the same hardware twenty times? Same environment, 25K. For Windows Server.

I tried to say this was as a bad idea and I was told that the generator will only take a few seconds to power up. My first thought was about power stability but apparently the electrical engineers have no problem providing 80 volts to 160 volts and that supply should just work fine. \n My opinion is not even being considered so I'm just going to do it despite my objections. I feel like this is begging for problems.\n I think this is a horrible idea but I have been tasked to remove the redundant UPSes to save on maintenance costs because utility power is good enough!!\n So how does everyone feel about this assessment.

          "description": "I worked on ERP software at two separate businesses that was published by one of the largest software vendors in the world. That crap hasn't changed in any fundamental way since the 50s, no joke. They kept adding \"modules\" that you had to pay for which supposedly gave the software new functionality. In reality, they were user requested changes to code that didn't work correctly in the first place. Companies were literally paying even more money for upgrades and updates that should have been provided by the vendor. The software was so error prone and full of bugs it made me shiver with rage every time we paid the maintenance agreement.\n The money they burned trying to keep that shit marginally functional was appalling. Support was sold to overseas call centers which made even the most mundane issue a days long slog. They would always promise big new changes were coming and year after year they would dole out a new sliver that made the software slightly more usable than before, for a price. It was just a glorified DB with no real higher functionality. Data mining was an arduous manual process with no tools etc. to facilitate. It relied heavily on external tools for basic use including a gawd awful java interface that barely functioned. \n It was slow, clunky, and contained NO automation of basic daily tasks. I invented multiple ways to mine what we needed and analyze millions of records for pertinent data. The lack of even basic input checks meant people were entering erroneous data on the regular that needed to be pruned, edited, or replaced. It became my full time job just keeping the wheels on. I will never work for another business that uses that crap as long as I live.\n    submitted by    /u/FatalDiVide  \n [link]   [comments]",

It reads and writes case info to a local mssql database to pull in each shipment's info and to write a tracking number to the case in the DB.\n We ship a lot, 350+ packages a business day easily\n Anyone that has dealt with worldship, knows it doesn't scale well to this volume, but I've made it work through weekly db maintenance on the admin and various tweaks etc. So yes it works, but it's the kinda free program that isn't really free and when there's a problem their support is useless and one of the IT team has to stay late.\n So I'm wondering if anyone here has a shipping platform they like that can do all these things. Cloud and web based would be amazing as long as they can pull up the shipment info by scanning an invoice, plop it on the usb scale, hit a button and then it prints on a networked label printer. We are currently in one building, but we are outgrowing it, so the quick scalability of a browser based cloud app is desirable. I imagine the ui would be more modern than the xp/Vista asthetic of worldship too.\n We've looked into a few, like shiprush for example but, while they would work, they seem geared more towards Ecommerce orders and the onprem sql integrations are an after thought.\n So anyone here have recommendations for a shipping platform geared more towards manufacturing enterprises?\n Thanks friends!\n    submitted by    /u/DarkSideMilk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello There. I have a client that i have never worked with before that has asked me to advise them on modernising their IdP. They currently have a combination of Active Directory, synching to AzureAD, but using ADFS for Auth. In addition to using ADFS for 365 authentication, they are also using several other applications (box.com for example) as well as using LDAP against the on-prem for some on-prem apps.\n They are eager to move to AzureAD (or another cloud IdP) to remove dependency on On-Prem.\n My thinking is that each app that uses ADFS is going to be handled differently. And that each one needs to be \"cutover\", there is unlikely to be any way to stage or transition from one Identity source to another.\n For 365 and Sharepoint and other MS Apps, i plan to recommend using Staged Mode, as they have some automation and workflows that have the expected ADFS webpage hard coded into their authentication, so i will leave the identitites used there in ADFS until they are \"dev'd\" out.\n Staging mode should in no way affect the third party apps, am i correct?\n My method is along the lines of \n Enable PHS in ADConnect & Seamless SSO -> Enable Staging Mode -> Migrate majority of Human Users to Staging Group (I can move the Automation Accounts as their devs update the app to support this)\n The above has no impact on the 3rd party apps, correct?\n But what about if/when i change my domain in AzureAD away from Federated to Managed? Does that impact?\n Ive been doing a lot of reading, and seen plenty of people say that they read too much into this, it ended up not being as complicated as expected. My issue is the client has a large regulated workforce that cannot accept significant downtime!\n    submitted by    /u/ReinaldoWolffe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am considering methods to connect remotely to my iMac across the internet from an iPad Pro. Ideally I will avoid services that enable the connection via an unrestricted server (udp holepunch) even when the service is advertised as encrypted (so teamviewer, jump and even vpns are excluded).\n I prefer direct connections (ssh for terminal access and rdp for the windows but don't like the risk associated with port forwarding. My solution is to implement tcp wrapper on the server and either restrict the client access to the smallest range of IP addresses from whichever location I am at or each time I connect, restrict the IP address to my actual IP address at the time. To configure the tcp wrapper I would connect to the server using jump and then once I have configured it take down that connection and then come in directly using rdp and ssh (with access restricted to my remote IP address only). The jump “daemon” will run for 5 minutes periodically (say, once or twice an hour) so the jump connection will only be available within that window.\n In summary use the udp holepunch style services (jump, Team viewer, vpn) as a way of initialising the direct connection and as a backdoor route if I manage to lock myself out but do 99% of my connectivity directly. If I am able to restrict access to just the range of IP addresses used by whatever ISP I am coming in from, I might only have to configure tcp_wrapper once for each ISP from which I am connecting. If that isn't viable, I am cool with re-initialising each time my remote IP changes.\n I should add that all my important passwords are 16 chars in length and all have lower case, upper case, numbers and special chars so I feel fairly protected against brute force attacks.\n what do you think of this plan?\n thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/macseguro  \n [link]   [comments]",

No admin status, back to 'do what you're told' development.\n One year ago I wasted most of my time teaching other teams the basics of Agile, AD, business analysis, and got told I couldn't speak to other admins over Windows and Websphere and Salesforce because 'I caused more trouble by sharing information.' They replaced our business analysts and PMs with 'product owners' they scrounged from other departments and forced into roles they don't understand, and told us not to talk to the business or face consequences.\n Five months ago I interviewed for an asset manager position for $20k more in an entirely different department, got an instant offer, and my C-Level immediately calls to offer me the same pay scale and the long-promised lead position a day later, provided they put the job up for anyone to apply to. I explained I had an outside offer for double what I was just offered (but with way fewer benefits and leeway).\n I played hardball in 2022-2023, management got scared about losing me, and I finally got the job.\n    submitted by    /u/fluffy_warthog10  \n [link]   [comments]",

They were inexpensive, and held up for the most part. \n TrippLite is no longer selling to us direct as they are part of EATON now. and sales is through distribution like everyone else. This is fine, but with that costs go up. \n But what about other brands? I see tons out there now and just don't have experience with anything other than TrippLite and APC (now part of Schneider). \n I've installed a couple CyberPower units, and the first one I got failed in the first week. They RMA'd it and covered return shipping, but it meant a 4 hour drive to swap and swap back.. The replacement just failed again after 18 months (if that). \n Middle Atlantic units seem expensive. \n What's the verdict on Vertiv? I've seen them more than once in the wild recently. \n Anything else I should look into?\n    submitted by    /u/muzicman82  \n [link]   [comments]",

Getting the client out is easy enough (deployment solution)... but like everywhere else in the last two years our workforce has scattered across the country lol. The deployment could take a week or two to complete and for some units we may want to be a bit more aggressive on the timeline to rollout.\n Also, any thoughts on this being deployed for servers? Again... this seems pretty strait forward assuming avoiding things like domain controllers/etc. Any other big gotchas we should be looking for/might see?\n Should have added...most of our environments are fairly simple domains but some are wide spread.

I can find plenty of pros and cons online about the general features and performance of each platform but I have a very specific concern about this potential switch over and that is the control and admin of the cloud recordings, let me explain.\n Zoom has a wonderful admin interface that allows us to see all cloud recordings in one place, this is used mainly in our Sales department. It is especially helpful when a user leaves the business, we are able to transfer all their Zoom cloud recordings to their line manager as we delete their Zoom account with ease.\n Google Meet seems to have a very bare bones approach to Meeting recordings. By default it will just save a recording to the meeting hosts Gdrive and that's it, no option to transfer to another user (i.e their manager) and no centralised control over these recordings.\n ​\n Am I totally seeing this wrong or is Zoom the clear winner in recording management with the meetings and calls?\n    submitted by    /u/Helpdesk_Peon  \n [link]   [comments]",

They suggested, instead of acquiring CAL licenses, to buy an RDP server implementation from another vendor (TSplus, never heard of that before) which is supposedly cheaper.\n That made me wonder if there are other alternatives (possibly an open source implementation of the RDP protocol).

AS2 uses a 1:N relation, you have 1 private key for n partner relations, so switchover should be done in concert.\n But looking at my AS2 server (mendelson) it appears not to \"try\" to use its new key when a partner sends a file using our new public key. It knows both its old and new keys.\n Is this some RFC all AS2 implementation suffer from or just un-user-friendly implementation ?\n I have a hard time believing I have to send a precise date/time to all my AS2 partners to make switchover successfull ?\n ​\n thanks\n    submitted by    /u/unannunciated  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am taking the sysadmin role in a small company and I originally learned computer sciences with a focus on application development, so while I know the basics I am missing a lot of experience with implementing servers. \n What I want to do:\n I'll have a central Ubuntu server that runs as a NAS and possibly run VMs for workloads (simulations, renders and a database). I need to manage permissions for user groups and individual users. I also want access via VPN for homeoffice users and would like to manage a universal login for every user (would be perfect to be able to import these) and not have several logins. \n I am aware of Windows Active Directory but since I decided not to bother with Windows as my server OS (mainly because of licensing and compatible database software) I want to do that on a Linux Server. \n Basically I want to manage access so that only specific groups of users or specific users can access certain folders, thats the most important thing right now. There are aproximately 30 users but the number will grow in the future. Clients are all using Windows and if I could use the windows login as authentication for server access that would be perfect.\n Its my first time planning a complex server setup from scratch with user management, but I want it to be well plannned and documented, so any help and advice would be appreciated. I am open to suggestions about the general server or network architecture and the software I'll use, but my Hardware needs to at least host a NAS, a DBMS and ideally a VM.\n Please let me know if anny more information is necessary and thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/tho3maxi  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I might be riding a bit of a high.\n Anyway, if you read this far, thanks. New job good, this day good. All good.\n    submitted by    /u/JaredNorges  \n [link]   [comments]",

I find it to be very leisurely with rare moments of frustration or stress.\n Maybe it would be good to have flair specifically for sharing a good change or policy that has been implemented at your work, or how you were able to find that one person with vendor support who was able to solve the problem you’ve been dealing with for months.\n Alternatively there could just be a weekly recurring thread that just contains positive anecdotes.\n    submitted by    /u/brianatlarge  \n [link]   [comments]",

Didn't ping me to let me know they were done.\n So, our git instances are VERY out of date. We're playing catch up on updates right now. It happens.\n Two weeks ago I announced my upcoming maintenance. I brought it up every day at least in passing to announce it. Explained it is going to take me nearly 3-4 hours to complete. It's just how it is. I told my teammates to let their pods know that I'm going to be doing this. I was very clear. However, an emergency happened and my coworker assured me they would have it done quickly so it didn't hold me back....\n Maintenance was supposed to start at 8 pm. 8:30 the pm they work with contacts me asking where they are. I don't know. I offered to do the maintenance for them so it doesn't slow me down. They declined saying that the person will be there soon.\n 8:45 they show up. I send them a message telling them to let me know once they're done so I can get started. 9:45 rolls around and nothing. I assume it's going bad so I offered to help. Nothing. I contact the pm. Nothing. I wait a few more minutes then get a message from the pm saying they've been done for a little while ago and he's surprised no one told me.\n It's now 10 pm. I've got a long maintenance to complete... And I'm the Early Morning team (I start at 7 am)\n Thanks. Really.

I am looking for a new one so maybe I can get some inspiration.\n I am working in IT - Server management\n currently got a Lenovo t14 from work with their image so its not my personal one. looking for a windows machine with bright display and maximum 2560px resolution, bc too much is bad for battery. life. I want to be able to work a whole day. I know that's not possible but maybe there is a laptop for 8h use with simple tasks like surfing and doin ssh. Also important for me is the performance. I want desktop class performance when I need it for adobe e. g. and want to be able to turn off the GPU and use the CPU integrated one for maximum battery life... might need to write a script for that^^ Screen size between 14 and 16 inch. 14 inch is a bit to small for me but would work.\n ​\n Looking into getting the X1 Extreme from Lenovo.\n What are you guys running and in which use case?

He says they have over 400 employees, but “only about half” have accounts and/or computers. Patches and backups are automated, you rarely need to be there after hours, etc. So overall, maybe it isn’t on fire?\n Either way I received notice that I was not selected, maybe since I was firm with my asking amount. All for the best, I suppose, since I found out the IT guy is related to the owner, after reading about some of their current and past lawsuits online…also, they asked several times if I was currently employed, which is obvious that I am, and that seemed like a red flag to me.\n Stay picky out there!\n    submitted by    /u/ramm_stein  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Regardless of which firewall we are using from one of the popular brands like Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco, or Sophos Fortinet, PA, Cisco or Sophos, what is the best way to allow a user to establish SSL VPN from only a specific device?\n While researching, I found that many of the admins suggest using PKI certificate-based authentication. However, I am concerned about the downsides of using a cert-based VPN.\n Firstly, certificates have a limited lifespan, which means I will have to monitor the age of all issued certificates continually. \n This could mean a lot of effort, especially if we have so many VPN users.\n Secondly, not all regular users are knowledgeable enough to install a certificate on their device, which would mean that I would have to bring the device in to have the certificate installed. This could be a repetitive process because the certificate has a definite lifespan.\n Given these concerns, I wanted to ask the community: what is the best way to restrict SSL VPN access to specific devices while avoiding the downsides of cert-based VPN? Are there any alternative methods or best practices that I should consider? \n Any insights or recommendations would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/techno_it  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are currently using Xtreme switches and core and moving on the Fabric. \n While my SAN switches are now not routed over the core and are different from my TOR switches. My 4 SAN switches are running standalone, 2 in each datacenter connected to each other. \n Now with Fabric incomming our network team want to use the same switch for TOR and SAN network both routed over the core, is this a good idea ? \n Currently i'm running a test cluster with a vmware host connected to 2 frabric switches for TOR & SAN and that traffic is running over our old core X8 back to our old SAN switch and our storage appliances. What I am seeing atm is there are only a few test VM's running on that host, but the latency is high. I wonder if this setup is a good idea or if it's better to keep SAN completaly seperated from the other traffic like it is in our current setup.\n    submitted by    /u/CBAken  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This just came up while configuring a new NAC deployment.\n Fairly common scenario that I've not thought through before. You have your relay agents (whatever they are) configured with a pair of dhcp servers to cover your ass. When the relay agent receives a request, does it forward to both, round robin, or some sort of stateful decision tree? Just finished reading rfc 1542 (best, most detailed description I could find) and I'm no better informed on the topic.\n At this point, I'd love to throw together a lab and experimentally check what a dozen different devices do, but have a few too many projects I'm behind on. Anybody already done this legwork?\n Whole question is because I stumbled upon instructions to setup the NAC mgmt port as an additional relay target and it will passively sniff for DHCP fingerprinting. Obviously clients get DHCP either way, just with more delays if there's some form of load balancing. But RR would mean fingerprinting is inconsistent across devices.\n    submitted by    /u/doll-haus  \n [link]   [comments]",

To do so, I select the interface, for example, interface ethernet 2, under that interface, then I create the “channel-group 20“ with the number and mode. Then I move to the interface “port-channel 20”, and associate that port channel with the mlag number (let’s say 20 as well). I'll do the same on the second switch so both switches know they are part of an LACP/Port-Channel with MLAG connection in case switch one goes down. \n Just need to know how I would configure MEC on the Cisco C9500 in a Stackwise Virtual mode.\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/fmaster007  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mostly phasing out older stuff, helping out our SD teams and working on incidents that occurred. Also we're occasionally involved with on-boarding new clients, fitting their needs. And other projects (think: new PoPs etc).\n Honestly, it kinda feels 'stale'. I like to play new shiny stuff once in a while. play around with it, see if it fits our use. For example software/tooling for QoL, other hardware, else. \n Reflecting on other engineering teams in other branches e.g. motorsports; they have engineers with a clear goal: win a race within certain rules. I don't think we (as NWE's) always have these clear rules. There is -however- one clear goal: it has to work. It mostly does not matter how (no clear rules).\n How would one create some kind of 'race' to squeeze every bit from a router. Having no jitter, or making sure you lose no packets in transit?

All 3 other switches' interfaces aren't working. All commands show the stack is functioning as normal however...\n 'show switch' shows all switches are a part of the stack no problem.\n ' show switch stack-ports' shows all is good with the stack cables\n Nothing in the logs is showing anything out of the ordinary, except for %SPI_FC-3-HIGH_WMARK_REACHED: Number of messages in the queue for channel 11 has reached maximum. Which i'm reading is a known bug on this code... shouldn't be an issue with stacking.\n We're able to reload all other switches individually with 'reload slot x' command, and reloading all other switches (except for the primary, because we dont want to reload the working one during business hours) didn't seems to fix it. After reloading the other member switches, they join back into the stack just fine. \n ​\n The member switches' ports are simply just not coming up. It's showing no link activity like there's no cable even plugged in. Tried bouncing the ports, and unplugging/replugging in cables, no luck.\n ​\n Has anyone ever ran into this? The plan is to reboot the whole stack tonight after work hours to see if that fixes, which i'm hoping it does.

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n We've had Cisco routers on order for over a year now and their ETA keeps getting pushed further out. I am wondering how prevalent different virtual router products such as VyOS, TNSR, or even CSR1K/CSR8K are in the enterprise non cloud environment for replacing traditional ethernet routers used for internet edge and private WAN connectivity. I understand there are some (very) large and small businesses that make use of them, but would like to understand how \"ready\" are they to replace traditional hardware-based internet/WAN routers? Most discussions around VyOS tend to be around home use rather than enterprise and VyOS/TNSR seem to be only occasionally mentioned in enterprise networking related discussions.\n Also, does anyone have experience with technical support for either? VyOS looks to be < $20K per year for unlimited installs and 1-4Hr support SLA. I feel I'd have a better time convincing management to try a products other than Cisco if they can be assured that they have decent support. There also aren't many concrete performance numbers published for VyOS but anecdotal evidence suggests that 10Gbps+ should be achievable even when hosted on ESXi. Are there any \"gotchas\" to look forward to with hosting any of these on ESXi as far as functionality, stability, and performance?\n Thank you all for taking the time to read this.\n    submitted by    /u/the_mastermind0  \n [link]   [comments]",

What hardware will I need to accomplish this? \n Second — for shared resources (i.e., printers) what’s the easiest way to have a device span multiple vlans in this way?\n Anything other questions I should be asking?\n    submitted by    /u/khoker  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am particularly interested in risk management (not security risk but potential impacts due to change).\n The ITIL framework is useful however there is an element that I struggle with, potential customers impacts, normally when defining potential, we might think as the worst case scenario, but even small simple changes could have big potential impact if we consider a typo when adding a new policy in an existing vrf, someone might say deleting or modifying policies are riskier, and I would normally agree, but when it comes to typos, missing a statement, wrong IP, community tag, etc, could have severe consequences.\n In my organization we have defined these categories to come with a number, the number will fall under ITIL thresholds, P1-P4, these are the categories:\n Potential Customer Impact, it is based on the activity being performed and the amount of customers potentially impacted.\n Type Element, it is a grouping that depends on type of element, for example, a core IP layer element would have higher value than a Voice or Data(Application layer) element.\n Service Area, based on the geographical area that the element is providing services, example, it could be region of a country, a state, it could be within a city.\n Service Density, amount of actual services that the element is supporting.\n As you can see, Type, Service Area and Service Density are based on the element where the work is going to be performed, but the Potential Customer Impact is based on the activity itself only.\n My struggle is finding a good balance in the risk management for the activity itself as there are many details like typos or missing small pieces of configuration that could create a big impact even though the activity itself could be a simple one. \n How does your organization manage risk from changes?

          "description": "Hello,\n Recently I've configured HSRP on our core switches. Because of the physical limitations of our fiber connections, we only have one trunk interface as the heartbeat interface between the two core switches. I set Core Sw1 as primary for all VLANs and Core Sw2 as the secondary for all VLANs. The configurations were successful and when I pull the ethernet cable going to our ASA, the traffic still flows through Core Sw2. However, when I unplug Core Sw1, we lose connection on the entire network. \n Quickly explaining our Core to ASA connection: the connection from Core Sw1 and Core Sw2 is a single cable connection from each of the Core Switch. We only have one ASA running on the network at the moment.\n What could be causing this problem? I brought up setting up STP root manually so that the VLANs have a cost to follow to the Distribution then to Core Switches, but my Supervisor is insisting that doesn't matter. If I can get a clear technical explanation as to why our failover isn't happening when Core Sw1 loses power it will be very helpful.\n    submitted by    /u/networkthinggy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi All. We are an IT consulting form and commonly perform site surveys for clients. Most of our clients have small to medium sized sites with between 5-20 APs. Lots of small warehouse clients that we do this for.\n Currently we use free predictive wireless heatmapping tools, and the free Wi-Fi analyzer tool to provide heatmaps and recommendations to clients. We basically use the existing AP placements and predictive heatmap tool to make an approximated heat map, then go onsite and use Wi-Fi analyzer to confirm the accuracy of the predictive heatmap and look for interference and optimal channels to set. It's pretty manual but fairly easy/not complex for us to do.\n Also we help them by recommending Wi-Fi settings such as the channels, etc. This has seemingly been enough for our clients and they've been happy with the results. We're able to make plenty of recomendations using our method.\n We've actually had clients tell us that another competitor came in and did a survey with other (paid) tools and the reports were overly confusing to them and took too long.\n We're starting to raise our prices for site surveys more towards what our competitors are charging, so I'm looking into paid site survey tools to see if they can provide anymore value to clients or efficiency on our end. \n What would ya'll recommend? We do around 1-2 surveys a month, mostly for small clients like I described above. I would prefer something cloud based, something we can easily install/license on our laptops (for our team of 5 engineers), no physical tool, and affordable (don't think we need something like Ekahau for these smaller surveys?). Right now I'm looking at NetSpot. \n Please let me know what you would recommend and why.\n    submitted by    /u/bhcs2014  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Everyone,\n I am looking for help/suggestions on a cisco design topology. I have a project where I'm moving data between sites that are geographically distant. I want redundancy within this system that will be using cellular as its backbone.\n I have visited the locations and completed cellular audits of the signal, bandwidth, etc. Were happy with the speeds and it appears for the most part connectivity shouldn't be an issue. But we cannot have tons of reliability issues. So redundancy is important.\n I have IR1101 cellular routers at my disposal. I have attached a drawing to show this topology.\n My questions is:\n How do I steer traffic to use one cellular connection as primary and when this connection fails use the other cellular connection? Policy based routing? if so, can you expand on how this actually works and maybe link something I can gather more information on the config its self. I am a working Network engineer but I have not done this specific config before. Funny enough, cisco makes this 100x harder than all other manufactures. Also costs 4x. But I have the routers so that's what were running with.\n Key Notes:\n Cellular SIMs are Private static routable IPS. These are not accessible from anywhere outside of this Private subnet provided by carriers. Meaning The VZW sims can talk to one another, and the ATTs can. But not between the two carriers. In addition these SIMs cannot reach the internet. Internet cannot reach them. (this is a paid service from the providers)\n I am starting with simple site-to-site VPN tunnels. redundant setup. Tunnel 1 between VZW sims. Tunnel 2 ATT SIMs.\n With this setup, I figure all I need is to tell the router. \"Hey always use VZW Cell interface, if it fails, go out ATT interface.\" Since both cellular connections are live, and they both have tunnels. The failover is simply switching the interface the traffic is going out.\n IMAGE BELOW:\n https://ibb.co/Q8tDvrL\n    submitted by    /u/PoweredByCory  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been working with TAC forever and 4500 switch tack blames firewall, firewall tac blames switch.

This is because they need to ensure that the network is up and running smoothly at all times, and any downtime or failure could result in significant losses for the organization.\n Compatibility and Integration: A network engineer may choose a brand that integrates well with other devices already in use in the network. This can simplify network management and reduce the likelihood of compatibility issues.\n Features and Functionality: Different brands offer different features and functionality, and a network engineer may choose a brand based on the specific needs of their organization. For example, a brand that offers advanced security features may be preferred for a network that handles sensitive data.\n Cost: The cost of networking devices can vary significantly between brands, and a network engineer may need to balance the cost with the needs of the organization. In some cases, a more expensive brand may be preferred if it offers better performance or reliability, while in other cases, a more affordable brand may be preferred if cost is a primary concern.\n  \nHaving said so, for our next school site (900 users) we could opt to continue using Ubiquiti devices which have an overall good price to performance and reliability ratio. However, within the community, there are several experts who keep on snubbing Ubiquiti as if it were an unreliable or less-enterprise grade devices.\n Given the the above brands, and the above thoughts, if you were asked \"Ubiquiti, why yes and why no\", how would you reply?

This is where my knowledge of networking starts to fizzle out as I believe a lot of the issues I am running into are because of NAT-T and potential limitations I might not know of or how to get around\n The NSX-V is connected directly with a public IP. I am connecting the on-site ASA to the cloud hosts NSX-V. In the snippets below the 216. is the NSX-V and the 10. is the ASA. All Phase 1 settings match and what is interesting is that if make a change to the tunnel on the NSX-V and save (like disabling and re-enabling PFS) the tunnel acts like it comes up on port 500.\n  6 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 302015 10.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 216.xxx.xxx.xxx 500 Built outbound UDP connection 9147 for Outbound:216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (216.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) to identity:10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500 (10.xxx.xxx.xxx/500) \n However after about ~30s I get this error and the tunnel continues to loop on port 4500\n 4 Mar 05 2023 22:15:45 750003 Local:10.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Remote:216.xxx.xxx.xxx:4500 Username:216.xxx.xxx.xxx IKEv2 Negotiation aborted due to ERROR: Auth exchange failed \n I saw in this VMware article that states potential issues with NSX-T and IPsec with NAT-T. So I would assume that same behavior is to be expected with NSX-V. I configured the NSX-V to only be a IKE Responder so that only the ASA would initiate the tunnel but I havent seen any change in outcome. https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/77288\n As a test I tried to build a policy-based IPsec tunnel to a USG I get somewhat similar behavior where Phase 1 completed however after that the tunnel is torn down and the reason being User-Requested. \n Just a little stumped, if anyone wants to toss some knowledge into my beggars cup. It would be much appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/Zypherex-  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm working on a reorganization of a relatively small data center into something resembling a decently designed, modular network. It's of a size where it doesn't need anything more than a collapsed core with ToR switches acting as a access. It's going to be L2 access for now because of equipment availability. Also because of its small size, I'm not doing any overlay networking.\n However, some of the hosts are VMhosts like ESXi and it occurs to me that they have their, virtual switches internally. Other than providing basic VLAN infrastructure, they aren't doing anything in terms of service provisioning, port density is a nonsensical concept for a vSwitch, and any interconnect to physical switches is, at most, going to be doing basic trunking/tagging.\n So, how do these fit into the outline of the infrastructure? I'm trying to get this design to be scalable -- small right, but possible to grow and evolve without major rip and replace of the whole thing rather than piece by piece over the years -- and data center networking is something I'm not deeply familiar with. Do you just ignore their presence, beyond ensuring there is no possibility of them causing L2 issues?\n    submitted by    /u/Mexatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem is even after a full wipe (format flash:) and reload from scratch, and after seeing a console message that it properly receives the .132 address from the DHCP server, it then reaches out to .135 anyway and I have no idea why.\n Here's some selected console output to show what I mean:\n %DHCP-6-ADDRESS_ASSIGN: Interface BVI1 assigned DHCP address 10.1.50.232, mask 255.255.255.128, hostname AP0081.c4fc.d39c %CAPWAP-5-DHCP_OPTION_43: Controller address 10.1.50.132 obtained through DHCP AP has SHA2 MIC certificate - Using SHA2 MIC certificate for DTLS. %CAPWAP-5-DTLSREQSEND: DTLS connection request sent peer_ip: 10.1.50.135 peer_port: 5246 \n This is after a full wipe and reload so I don't think there can be any leftover config pointing the AP to .135\n    submitted by    /u/MScoutsDCI  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Again, Reddit! I've come to ask for some help with a port forwarding issue I've got going on.\n My edge/gateway device is a Sonicwall TZ215 running SonicOS 6.X. I have an A record as sub.domain.tld on my public DNS that points to this device's WAN interface IP. No issues there.\n My internal host is a Proxmox host running a few web servers. I have a port forwarding rule on the Sonicwall to reach the Proxmox web UI from the internet on HTTPS/TCP port 8006. I have an SSL certificate installed on the Proxmox host for sub.domain.tld. This works perfectly.\n I am now trying to add more web servers to this subdomain on other ports, i.e. https://sub.domain.tld:8443 and http://sub.domain.tld My issue is that I get an ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED in my browser for any other port.\n My NAT configuration for the other two web servers that I'm trying to reach matches the NAT configuration for the working web server, the Proxmox host on https://sub.domain.tld:8006, except I created a service object entry for HTTPS/8443. That's the only difference. Still, I get ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED.\n I did a packet monitoring in the Sonicwall appliance to try to isolate the issue and I see the traffic is being dropped to the internal hosts using 80 and 8443, due to \"Error code 40 (Enforced firewall rule)\".\n There isn't any kind of p@cket trac3r or traffic simulator like ASA has so I'm kind of at a loss. There really aren't any other firewall policies set up since this is a really basic and new configuration, so I can't imagine there'd be anything conflicting.\n The reachable web server and the non-reachable web servers are in the same network zone as defined by the Sonicwall, so it shouldn't be an access issue either.\n I can reach the web servers both internally and on a separate network segment for VPN. \n I'm stumped, any ideas? Thanks in advance for anyone's input.\n    submitted by    /u/zfs_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just thought I'd do a PSA for this in case anyone runs into this issue again. We had a request to make some NDI capable cameras work with OBS over our enterprise wireless (this particular SSID had to be created on our older Cisco 8510 due to the APs involved). The cameras themselves I believe are Mevo brand.\n After making some tweaks to get the cameras connected and accessible from the Mevo mobile app (client isolation was turned on in the WLAN config so easy fix), the next issue was that the devices were not being discovered as NDI camera sources in OBS. NDI uses mDNS but I was having issues finding the specific service string so we could add it to the mDNS snooping allow list. Ended up doing a packet capture to find it: \n _ndi._tcp.local.\n Simple enough but even searching this in Google now that I know the answer didn't bring in a lot of results so I wanted to post this and hopefully it is helpful to someone in the future.\n    submitted by    /u/Dotren  \n [link]   [comments]",

Across all of those I have one VLAN which is our AV VLAN with about 180 devices of various types of AV equipment from Teams Rooms to Dante microphones/speakers, amplifiers, control systems and Crestron NVX encoders/decoders. Everything works perfectly fine. \n I’m trying to add a new audio conferencing solution that needs to connect to some cameras using ONVIF for control. The main system sends out a discovery to the network to find any cameras. The cameras can also be manually added but then after populating the details it sends an ONVIF discovery probe to get all the details of the device. These processes don’t work at all on the AV network. If I change the addresses of these devices to any other subnet it works. \n My assumption is that there’s too much traffic flying around on that network and the messages are getting blocked somehow. I’m at a loss as to how to rectify it though. All the stacks have 10gig uplinks with no saturation, igmp snooping configured, igmp querier set to collapsed core Nexus. Any ideas what I might be missing?\n Edit: I got it. It was an issue with MTU and jumbo frames.\n    submitted by    /u/StuntedGorilla  \n [link]   [comments]",

This week, my main and only customer told me that they will no longer be requiring my services -- the (in)famous pink slip (or email, in this case).\n Won't get into too much detail in order to not breach the NDA, but it's one of the largest financial institutions in Europe. I was handling several DC's for them, and they decide they no longer need those DC/branch offices. They will be moving all their apps to the cloud, and all their personnel back to their HQ. They'll only have a skeleton crew at the locations which I manage, so that makes my role rather redundant. \n The reason I opened this thread is not to complain ( I'm single, no obligations, no rent, and I have several certs, including CCNP Enterprise and JNCIS-SP), but I'm curious what is the status of remote work where you're currently at ?\n This contract was 100% remote. Since I got the news this week, I think applied to some 200 jobs already, and while I found some very interesting ones which were a good fit, and which paid even better than my current contract. However all of them required either hybrid or on-site presence. \n Since the pandemic ended, what was the policy in your company in regards to remote/office hours ? And what do you think will be the future of remote work, especially for us ICT folks ? \n Also, if you happen to know anyone looking for a 100% remote based network engineer, don't hesitate to reach out to me in private.\n    submitted by    /u/WhatNot4271  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know that CCNA is one of if not the most popular IT course so it shocks me that a trainee position in a network role doesn't offer it as part of their programme.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/InFernoZ22  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am in the early stages of getting started with Ansible for some network automation. Currently, use cases are small for now (update helper-addresses, NTP servers etc) but I expect to go further down the rabbit hole and maybe leverage it for full site deployments.\n Anyway, one of the things that is being discussed is integration with Jenkins CI/CD. As a pure network engineer, I honestly have no idea how Jenkins works and what is involved with it and why it would be beneficial to us but none the less I will need to research it.\n So first question, is there any resource out there (book, blog, youtube etc) that gives some good insight into Jenkins purely from a network perspective? \n And finally, is Ansible Tower considered CI/CD? Ansible Tower to me seems just like a GUI for pushing playbooks which would obviously make it more user friendly for someone who want to push a playbook but not have to write the code in Ansible. Example, would be that I create a bunch of playbooks and someone else who is not fully up to speed, could just come along, modify the variables to the relevant devices, and then push it out. Is this what Jenkins tries to achieve?\n    submitted by    /u/cona44  \n [link]   [comments]",

Once a week or soall of its port-channel members ungroup and then immediately group back up (I have lacp long-timeout set). I turned on RSTP and LACP debug events but it essentially just logs the fact that those ports ungrouped and not the reason why they did it in the first place. No alarms or other environmental thresholds were reached. I'm trying to find some kind of event or traffic burst in my network to explain these events but it is difficult. I'm trying to think of ideas of what I could check to figure this one out.\n I changed the firmware from the older to the latest but it didn't seem to have any effect.\n ​\n I noticed some possible causality on one of my access switches connected to the router. I was migrating my router from old hardware to new and the issue of port-channel flapping moved to the new after moving this particular access switch (although I can't be sure). I noticed that port-channel for that switch has counter for \"giants\", but I'm not sure if that can have any affect on the switch itself (giants = packets that are greater than the MTU size).\n    submitted by    /u/OzschmOz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Slightly strange request....\\\n I've been tasked with setting up temporary wifi and internet for a building. There are 3 floors and each floor is c. 80m x 50m. The floors are largely open - no walls, just empty space. We do not have access to the building's internet and we may (or may not) have access to normal consumer-level electricity supply.\n It just needs to be be there for a couple of weeks. 50 wifi temperature sensors will beplaced on each floor and will connect to the wifi and transmit their small amount of temperature data to a cloud service.\n I'm thinking we will likely need three 4G mobile internet routers (one per floor) and then a wifi access point (or more than one) for each floor. And possibly a UPS for each floor to supply the power to them - although hoping that electricity will be possible.\n No floor-to-floor cabling will be allowed and only minimal, exposed cabling allowed on each floor.\n So I guess my questions are chiefly:\n  \nWill one WAP per floor be able to deal with 50 low-data devices and the 80mx50m area?\n If so (or if not) what devices would you recommend\n Anything else I ought to be thinking about?\n  \nThx\n    submitted by    /u/Codga69  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have only mikrotik dude to monitor entire network. We use only mikrotiks.What would be the best network monitoring software to monitor network for free? I can't take care of my network if I can't see what's going on in it properly. The dude only displays bandwith after 24hrs.

So it seems like there is intermittent packetloss stemming from one specific device in our network… our Nexus 7706. At random times nodes all over our network stop responding and the common denominator is they are all patched to the 7706. They don’t all go down at once but when an event occurs you can be assured it’s patched to the nexus. It’s very random in both the time it happens as well as the devices it happens to – but again all uplinked to the 7706. \n So my question is – where would I begin on troubleshooting this? Any real world advice here? This is where those damn ccna books do nothing for you… and unfortunately I’m a one man shop so I don’t have anyone to seek guidance from.\n    submitted by    /u/Avionticz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am configuring a 3900 from FS (first one I've purchased from them) and it will be used as a WAN switch sitting between the ISP equipment to share the connection to two firewalls in an HA config (active/standby). There is a second ISP that connects to the HA firewalls and the equipment from that ISP has multiple ports for WAN and a WAN switch isn't needed on the second ISP link.\n It is a 24 port switch and I plan on using interfaces 1-12 for the WAN VLAN (to avoid using VLAN 1 and all 24 ports). I've already added the WAN VLAN and added those ports to that VLAN.\n The mgmt interface will be used for local access/configuration.\n Here are my questions (so far).\n  \nI'm going to confirm LLDP isn't active on ports 1-12.\n I'd like to configure SNMP to only send data to my internal SNMP server. I've seen switches/network devices that have fields/commands to send SNMP data to specific servers, but I've also left those fields blank and I can still log into my NMS and pull SNMP data from the switch given I have the correct information.\n  \nI'm currently reading through the 3900 manual to confirm the LLDP and SNMP commands, but I wanted to see if anyone here had any other suggestions that I may be missing to avoid leaking out data/information that should be avoided on the WAN side.\n Traditionally we've never done anything fancy to WAN switches, they are just L2 switches that we throw into the mix and we've also never had any management other than a local console cable IF a change needed to be made. Going forward, I'd like to change this and given that I have a local network port for management, I'd like to secure this switch the best way that I can.\n The default credentials have already been changed.\n Thanks.\n Edit- In other switches I've used, the management port is usually listed as out of band. I haven't found that to be the case for this 3900 switch.\n    submitted by    /u/tdhuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the L3 switch I've issued the static route command and set next hop as the Juniper interface that connects to the L3 switch.\n I added a static route in on the Juniper also, with next hop as L3 switch interface. However, when trying to ping from the Juniper network into the L3 network, my gateway comes back with destination net unreachable. In fact, when I logon to the Juniper over SSH, and try pinging the L3 switch interface, I get \"no route to host\" and when I look at the Juniper routing table, I see an entry for the L3 switch interface listed as a \"rejected\".\n I read somewhere that you can't simply add a static route onto a non point-to-point link on a Juniper. If that is the case, can someone explain how I can configure a basic static route on here?\n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/No_Barracuda_3615  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My fellow Redditors,\n I am redistributing BGP from my router into an OSPF process located in a VRF (Area 1). My router is connected to the Neighbor Router via Area 1. Area 1 is configured as a stub area. \n My understanding of a stub area is that it blocks Type 5 LSAs. I am redistributing into the OSPF process that includes the stub area. Since my path would be BGP -> OSPF (Backbone Area 0) -> OSPF Area 1 (VRF) -> Neighbor Router (Area 1), does the Stub router located in OSPF Area 1 deny the Type 5 LSA coming via the Backbone area? \n My understanding is that a Stub Area does not allow an ASBR to exist within it. My router that is redistributing BGP -> OSPF would be considered an ASBR. However, since I'm going from OSPF Area 0 to OSPF Area 1 in a VRF, does the VRF act as an ABR (and not an ASBR) thereby allowing the Stub area to receive the type 5 LSA?\n I understand the simple solution is to configure the Neighbor Router as a NSSA. However, this may not be a possibility. \n Am I overthinking this? It is as simple as I am coming from BGP -> OSPF and the Stub Area prevents that type 5 LSA from entering it (VRF or not)?\n    submitted by    /u/networkmonk3y  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I've been working on a project that involves taking the existing network of 192.168.1.0, splitting it up into VLANs and creating additional VLANs to allow for a Data Network and Voice Network. I have a Layer 3 core switch which is connected to an ASA and all of the VLANs are configured on the core switch. I implemented the design this weekend and am having trouble with the connections from the new VLANs to the pre-existing network.\n My configuration is as follows:\n ASA\n int g1/1 - Outside\n int g1/2 - Inside - 192.168.1.1 (Connected to Core Switch)\n route inside 192.168.101.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2\n route inside 192.168.102.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2\n route from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.2 is directly connected via g1/2 \n Core Switch\n vtp mode server\n int g1/0/1 (Connected to ASA)\n switchport access to vlan 10\n int vlan 10\n ip add 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0\n ip helper-address 192.168.1.30\n int vlan 80\n ip add 192.168.101.1 255.255.255.0\n ip helper-address 192.168.1.30\n int vlan 90\n ip add 192.168.102.1 255.255.255.0\n ip helper-address 192.168.1.30 \n ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 \n ip routing is enabled \n So here's what I've found so far:\n I can ping from 192.168.1.x to any other VLAN\n I can't ping the other way around\n DHCP is working. I'm able to receive all DHCP information and can reach the internet.\n I can ping all SVIs and ASA from 192.168.101.x\n I can't ping between 192.168.101.x and 192.168.102.x networks \n There are ACLs applied to the inside interface on the ASA, but they appear to permit all icmp traffic and all ip traffic.\n I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this exact issue as searching on Google has been no help. I mostly get results with configurations that involve using the ASA for Inter-VLAN networking, using sub-interfaces and whatnot. I am strictly trying to setup Inter-VLAN networking on the L3 switch. Any help would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/gigapet  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need to get 4 networks on the switch run through 2 vrfs out two physical interfaces up to the firewall where Policy can handle it and let things go out to the internet. I am having trouble actually configuring it.\n The basic set up is kind of like this: \n VR-Office\n vlan 12\n 10.10.12.0/22\n 10.10.12.1 gateway \n vlan 16\n 10.10.16.0/24\n 10.10.16.1 gateway\n int eth1/1 ip add 172.16.16.129 #the far end will have an add of 16.130 \n VR-Accounting\n vlan 112\n 10.20.12.0/22\n 10.20.12.1 gateway \n vlan116\n 10.20.16.0/24\n 10.20.16.1 gateway\n int eth1/2 ip add 172.16.16.133 #other side will have address 16.134 \n I need the two vlans to have an svi per vlan that I can add to the associated VRFs. Then I need to route to physical interfaces associated to the vrfs.\n The way I logically manage it in my head I imagine that the office vrf has two SVIs, one per vlan, with each having the IP address of the vlans gateway. Then the office vrf also has the physical interface. \n I want to make sure that the vlans 12 and 16 are only routing on vrf vr-office and can be routed our eth1/1 to get out. \n Am I misunderstanding anything?

Also, what if I'm connected to a single DNS server that supports DoT and the cached IP address disappears or something? How are these situations handled? And if you just cannot resolve any query then are you supposed to provide the IP address of the server as a fallback option?

So vlan default = vlan 1. Wouldn't each interface act the same with anything on vlan 1?\n The change I am making is swapping po1 and 2 vlans. So I don't know why when I move po1 (which owns the default, or vlan1 traffic) to po2, traffic stops flowing.

Anyone with a keen interest in learning automation can get to that point in no time at all.\n With that being said, I’d really appreciate some seasoned automation people to share cool ideas they’ve implemented. \n I was thinking of looking into how to create a web GUI that takes in a command and runs them against some specified devices. But then I think Ansible Tower is pretty similar to that, so I don’t think that would be the best return on time for me to create that (bearing in mind it’d take me a long time to learn how to create web GUIs).\n This post was borne out of a desire to understand how to get to the next level.

But the thought of working on a firewall puts up a mental block of \"I can't do this, this is beyond me\".\n I want to change that and I started with doing the Sophos Network Engineer certification since my MSP uses Sophos products.

Mostly for smaller scale government networks. I've made it to the final round of interviews for a position as an MPLS engineer.\n I feel confident about some of the things they want, like L2 switching, L3 routing, OSPF/BGP and Cisco familiarity. The problem is that I haven't touched MPLS professionally in a while, and when I did it was on the customer end. The company I'm interviewing with is a provider. Aside from a core understanding of MPLS, I've also been told they're going to want to talk about: Segment Routing, Pseudowire, VRF, VPRN, VPLS, EVPN, 1588, and TWAMP. They've also mentioned the ISIS routing protocol which I'm not too familiar with.\n I understand the theory of MPLS and I've been individually researching these other topics. I was wondering if you guys know any solid video series, courses/labs, or books that would cover most or all of these things under the MPLS umbrella. The interview is next week so my aim is not to sound like a complete clown when I talk about MPLS. Any advice appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/HaleMorne  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each user connects to this and a user (client) can request to be matched with another user (host). If a suitable host is found, the host is notified of the client and vice versa, they then start punching each other. This setup seems to work as intended, for most cases at least...\n The problem I am facing is in the case that the hosting user is on a non-public ip adress. The \"handshake\" via hole punching does not seem to get confirmed and the connection fails.\n Is there some kind of way to solve this issue? A relay server is not really part of the plan as it includes additional latency and costs.\n ​\n Edit: or could this issue not be related to the IP being private and instead be a router issue?\n    submitted by    /u/Fapstep  \n [link]   [comments]",

My initial thought was obviously some time of switching loop. Fast forward a few days, we start seeing the same behavior on multiple (50-100) ports throughout the network. The only commonality between these ports are that they all have a USB-C style docking station attached to them with a laptop. Port-security is helping stop the mac-addresses from overloading, but I'm curious if anyone has ever ran into something like this? We have tried updating the drivers on the docking station with no avail. Some ports are learning almost a mac-address/second. The mac-addresses seem to be totally random as well. When looking up the OUI, many come back with nothing. Any help would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-Championship2679  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, does the notes I've made below (along with the one question too) sound about right when describing active vs passive authentication? Let's assume the firewall I mentioned to is a Firepower device too (not that it would matter anyway)\n Active authentication actively prompts the user to sign in before they try and access a website and then after that it will go through the access policy to see if that user account matches any rules for that username for them to be able to access a particular website. You can specify what managed device (computer/vm) you want the user to see this authentication prompt on when they try and access the internet. When it says authentication method is HTTP basic, what does that mean? Does it mean that the device (firewall) will open a port 80 connection with the domain controller to check to see if the users entreded creds are correct and then authenticate the user? \n Passive authentication won't prompt the user when they're on a device and will instead check ISE (which is acting as the user agent) to tell ISE to go and check AD for the ip to user and group mappings for the account that is presented to ISE and then retrieves that info from the DC's and builds the connection logs out also uses that information to then go through the access policies and check to see if any rules are hit too \n These 2 authentication methods only work with 80/443 traffic\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Anyone had any luck trying to use Clearpass for returning DPSKs to a Ruckus controller?\n It's one of those things that would be relatively easy on a more open platform, but looks impossible on a locked-down appliance like Clearpass.\n Clearpass certainly supports the MAC auth that the Ruckus uses in External DPSK mode. And it has no problem in returning Ruckus VSA 142 that should contain a modified version of each PSK. The problem is in storing the PSKs.\n As per the Ruckus docoumentation for the DPSK format, Clearpass would have to be able to use one of the SHA1 key derivation functions and then store a byte array based on a combination of the SSID and the PSK. Let's assume the PSK is admin-assigned, not generated for each client by Clearpass. The natural place to store a DPSK would be a custom dictionary attribute in the Endpoints repository, however, these do not support byte arrays, nor do they provide any access to basic functions. In this case the required function is definitely available to the underlying system as Clearpass uses it for hashing admin user passwords. In any case since the DPSK format is zero-padded a string field cannot be used instead.\n Anyway, I figured it worth asking if anyone had found a solution.\n    submitted by    /u/perryurban  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of which is coming up due no longer being able to get support or licences for the Watchguard M200.\n We are having to look at upgrading possibly part of this setup or all of it as part of a refresh due to this and preventative in case of failure of the hardware since its over 6 years old. (before my time). We have no choice but to upgrade the Watchguard m200 since the licensing which we just renewed Jan 2023 (paid for one year) but only can get it till end of June this year.\n We have been quoted by the company which we outsource some of this the Meraki kit from cisco. \n The MX105 to replace the router/firewall which is currently a Watchguard M200.\n MS120-48FP in place of the two HPE switches and \n MR44 to replace the ubiquity wifi access points.\n ​\n However from the research I have done, it feels quite overkill. We have about 40-50 employees in the office and 100 others working on phones remotely (which don't need to really connect to the office network). Only users which need to VPN access to the office network is about 10-20 users.\n ​\n I'm Torn between the two options (open to other options), \n  \nReplace only the Watchguard M200 with the latest equivalent and upgrade the controller for the AP's to a more reliable one. \n Follow the recommendation but possibly with a MX75 instead of a MX105.\n  \nOne thing that does confuse me is whether some of the security features are tied to licences (advanced security, enterprise or SD-WAN) or to the devices. Features such as content filtering and web search filtering and intrusion protection. \n What they quoted us came to about £27,000 for kit and licences for 3 years. I'm quite new to this could use some advice\n    submitted by    /u/OZA_IT  \n [link]   [comments]",

The client settings and WLAN are exactly like the interop report. Doing wireshark traces does not reveal the problem. Did several Ascom log traces and when I caught the problem, notify Ascom and apparenly we do not have some super duper special docking station which allows me to view the log file. Absolutely livid about that. Getting no real help from Ascom other than they want more Omnipeek traces. \n I have been concentrating on one zone at a time.

Currently it is set up with RSTP, the MC-LAG interfaces are set to point to point and other interfaces are edge, the ICL between the stack has RSTP disabled, and it's set block BPDU on edge.\n The Cisco portion of the network has Rapid-PVST+, the core is the root bridge, the others are default, access ports are portfast, etc. basic Cisco set up really.\n I am not sure if I should disable all STP on the MC-LAG interfaces to the core and management switch, the MC-LAG stack is an aggregate switch stack, should it just pass through the BPDU packets? I believe this is what the Juniper documentation is getting at but it's a little wishy washy on that. This would basically leave Cisco to run STP on its network, and just leave the rack alone. Or do I pass through the packets and enable Rapid-PVST+ on the management switch, on the other side of the Juniper MC-LAG?\n Or should I also be setting up the Juniper MC-LAG stack to be handling the incoming BPDU packets from the Cisco? I would have to add PVST to it as well for interoperability, I am just not sure how this may affect the RSTP running locally, which was recommended to be enabled by Junipers docs.\n Any help would be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/misterezekiel  \n [link]   [comments]",

These devices essentially all rely on multicasting, IGMP, and are in the realm of 10Gb to 25Gb per device/host. One issue that i've seen frequently in some courses panels in regards to switch stacking, is that by stacking switches you can quickly run into severe multicast flooding. Arista deals with this through what they call \"Multi-cast Orchestration\" on their own switches, and Netgear acknowledges it's an issue and says \"Care should be taken\" when stacking switches- however I haven't heard anyone mention how to actually prevent or stop that multicast flooding on a network without something like Arista's proprietary product. Is there a common approach to handling this I'm not aware of or some 3rd party product which can handle this? What is the \"care\" you would even take to prevent that form of multicast flooding? \n The reason for the stacked switches is to achieve 100% redundancy, allow easier expandability, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/Not-Satan-But-Close  \n [link]   [comments]",

Palo is scheduled this week to discuss why they are the best.\n our IT security team is pushing Checkpoint hard. Their basis is it’s the most secure and point to 2 things. Testing showing that they block way more attacks than all the others and a claim that there are no CVEs in the last 8 years. The first item I’m disregarding because it’s a checkpoint sponsored test comparing Physical Hardware to VMs. \n However the second claim has me intrigued.

About 40% to 50% google and another 40-50% facebook. Ive recently got my network its own ASN and public ipv4 ipv6. \n Right now I have sent a request to google about it. Im just curious to know since on their website, it doesnt show any other requirements aside from having to have asn and ipv4 in RIR directory. \n Does google require certain TRAFFIC to be able to qualify for GGC?\n THANKS!\n    submitted by    /u/gstheft  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have decided to take a job working for a federal contractor due to the pay increase and benefits for my family. \n The job that I ended up taking is pretty much help desk stuff at a healthcare facility. \n The trouble I think about is whether I made a choice that puts me back a few steps or if I've made a good choice. \n Background:\n My current job as a net admin is pretty wtf imo. It was all good at first with my previous boss. Like I stayed within the confines of my JD but he left and now instead of being the net admin to all 3 separate departments, I'm stuck messing around trying to help 1. \n Firstly, my boss doesn't know anything about Wi-Fi, networking and network devices. He does know voice stuff I guess? (supposedly. He basically relies on support to give him all the answers and then says it like he knew all along). \n Secondly, I am technically supposed to resolve networking issues for the IT department as a whole, clients and most installs as well as build networks for projects but I'm too busy trying to run around and be the manager my boss isn't for 1 group that I wasn't even supposed to pay this much attention to. \n Thirdly, I am honestly running around trying to be a dude in construction and find ways to get an install done for clients without having the company spend on contractors to do that work professionally. It's the weirdest thing ever. \n Lastly, My JD explicitly stated I'm only supposed to be resolving network issues and build our large projects and when I bring this up I get the \"I know. Thank you. You're really doing amazing.\" \n There's more to the story but I'm really trying to not rattle on.\n    submitted by    /u/ClowNSoundZ  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Atoms almost always fail and require a power cycle or a complete factory reset before the update can succeed. The AP250s exhibit the same behavior, but not as often. Sometimes I do have to deactivate PoE on their backhaul ports to get them to eventually behave.\n Every AP is backhauled btw, no mesh. \n To troubleshoot, I've consoled into a couple while this process happens, but the logs I see give no clear indication of why updates could have failed besides some vague messages about losing connectivity to the cloud.. but they're rebooting and won't have connectivity to anything. The cloud console gives no information whatsoever after a failure. In the device list, the ones that eventually fail get stuck at 12% on the progress bar... for HOURS.\n These are all legacy Aerohive devices by the way. We had these before AH was acquired by Extreme. Are we running into some kind of planned deprecation situation? The thing that bothers me is even when we were running Aerohive's Mangler, this stuff still happened, but not as bad and way less frequent.\n Is extreme/aerohive's cloud management just this bad? Or is there something wrong with how these are deployed/operating? These things are workhorses. And after tuning the hell out of the system due to a high-density/high-interference environment, users have been happy.

Now they decided to buy the property across the street and covert it to another 5 rooms for the hotel. They want internet and IP cameras across the street.

Theres no vegetation in the line of sight, but it rains a lot. Currently I use a Huwei LTE modem/router with 3 Unifi AP's. I think I am going to add a load balancing router so I can use two ISPs for more consistency and speed. \n The owner said we could bury a conduit if we want. Also I could hypothetically use the utility poles to span cable (is that a good idea)? I want something thats going to work 99% of the time. I don't live down there so if theres a problem, I have to call and walk someone (usually with very little IT experience) through how to reset a device or trouble shoot.

During the interview we had to complete a skills test that was set up in a collapsed core configuration:\n Cisco catalyst 9500 as the core/distribution switch and a Cisco Catalyst 9300 as the access. One of the Objectives was to set up an etherchannel link between the distribution and access layer switches and using port channel 1 as the container. The directions were vague so I assumed they'd leave it up to the interviewee to choose PAgP or LACP so i opted to set each side to channel group mode on. When I tried to apply the configuration both the 9500 and 9300 spit out \"command rejected\" I forget the exact verbage. In the end, I ended setting the distribution switch to channel group mode active and the access switch to passive and the etherchannel relationship formed. My I'm just scratching my head as to why mode on was rejected.\n EDIT: fixed some grammar and verbage\n    submitted by    /u/Mechin17  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey Ya'll,\n I'm deploying DOT1X EAP-TLS port authentication with a fallback guest VLAN on Cisco Catalyst C3850 switches used for access to offices and shared workspaces. I've followed the Cisco guides and have the proof of concept system working.... mostly. I am running into an issue with DHCP after assignment to the guest VLAN. When authentication fails or times out the port is assigned to the guest VLAN. However the Windows DHCP service times out and self assigns an AIPA address before the DOT1X authentication failure/timeout occurs. The Windows machine will then sit on the Guest VLAN without an IP address for approximately 5 minutes before the Windows DHCP service reattempts a DHCP request and is successful.\n The reason I'm asking this here, is that I would like to adjust my switch configs to account for this since theoretically devices getting assigned to the guest VLAN won't be under my control to adjust Windows DHCP settings.\n Is there a best practice or recommended DOT1X auth timeout?\n The proof of concept is using this setup on the ports:\n interface GigabitEthernet1/0/X\n switchport mode access\n device-tracking attach-policy dot1x\n authentication event fail action authorize vlan 5\n authentication event no-response action authorize vlan 5\n authentication open\n authentication port-control auto\n authentication timer reauthenticate 180\n authentication violation replace\n dot1x pae authenticator\n dot1x timeout start-period 5\n dot1x timeout held-period 1\n dot1x timeout auth-period 18\n    submitted by    /u/mixinitup4christ  \n [link]   [comments]",

We maintain an alias in our firewall for customer IP addresses\n \nBackup files are encrypted with a 2048bit key as they are generated at the customer site. They cannot be read without this key\n \nThe connection itself is TLS from the customer server to the backup appliance\n \nThe backup client at the customer sites must have a seperate 2048bit key in order to connect and have Read/Write access to the backup appliance\n \nThe backup appliance is off domain and uses a separate set of credentials from anything else\n \n  \nHere is the debate.\n A coworker is pretty insistent that we should be running these connections over a VPN of some sort. Either OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IPSec maybe. I have countered that since the backups themselves are encrypted AND are being sent over TLS, this is not necessary and would harm performance.\n What do you think?

Nothing new is in production yet, we're still in the planning phase, and we're trying to figure out how difficult this will be (we're in a manufacturing environment where some sites work 3 shifts and almost never shut down).\n According to this compatibility matrix, it should work. Here's a screenshot of the relevant section.\n I've got one of the 9800s online and I've got a spare 2702 AP that I'm testing with.

          "description": "Hi,\n Not sure if this exists yet, but can we create an International BGP community standard or something along those lines for advertising your prefixes so we know what Country/State/Province/Region/etc your prefixes are located?\n We operate a latency sensitive network and have to constantly filter certain prefixes from being learnt via certain AS' so they have optimal routing and it is a tedious task. \n This is where I had the idea that surely there had to be a better way and the first thing that came to my head is BGP communities that will identify the Country/State/Province/Region/etc. For example, an ASN with the 123.123.123.0/24 prefix in Japan Hokkaido Region can have a BGP community of 11:1 announced with their prefix. 11 being the Country (Japan) and 1 being the Hokkaido Region. (Side note: I really hope we end up giving Japan 11 as their BGP community code as a *tips fedora* to Code Geass).\n I'll admit this is not fully thought through yet and I wanted to open up the discussion to the networking community to hear their thoughts. The first issue I can forsee is AS' that strip BGP communities. In my head this International BGP community standard would be most useful in IXs.\n TLDR; If you operate an ASN can you advertise your prefixes with a BGP community that will identify the Country:/State/Province/Region/etc?

The remote site is on a cable internet circuit. At all my sites, including the remote site, 802.1X with EAP-TLS is used for both wireless and wired auth. This has been working great for months, until my ISP changed which backbone on their network my DIA connection runs across. No other changes were made anywhere other than the provider's backbone that's delivering the DIA circuit.\n The IP address of the SRX in the DC didn't change and the tunnel is still up and working. I can't find any evidence of issues with the tunnel, except .1X doesn't work anymore. On the NPS servers in the DC, event viewer shows that auth requests are coming in from the switch and AP at the remote site, but it almost seems like the .1X requests are getting mangled across the site-to-site tunnel. The same NPS servers service .1X for hardwired and wireless clients across several other sites connected via the ISP's MPLS without issue.\n Event viewer shows that auth requests from the AP at the remote site get logged as event id 6274 \"The RADIUS Request message that Network Policy Server received from the network access server was malformed.\" Auth requests from hardwired ports from the remote switch show that rather than the computer name with a certificate, the request shows the client trying to auth with its mac address as the username and PAP and summarily denied.\n A tech at the ISP that made the backbone change and I have been beating our heads against the wall for a few days now with no progress. I've resorted to installing wireshark on the NPS server to try to find differences between known-good auth packets and broken packets, but haven't found an obvious difference yet.

Some sites even have various other types of encryption. From my understanding, typically the site rtr does NOT have MPLS config, though we still have MPLS qos config on each site rtr, along with the hub having MPLS qos config. Our hub feeds into another MPLS network we own - after collectors - so I’d presume, if the marking is kept, that it could be used for our campus MPLS qos (I think that’s the teams thought here). However, peeling back the onion, it was revealed to me by AT&T, that each site doesnt necessarily have a COS profile ordered with them , which would explain some of the asymmetrical issues seen while traffic went through AVPN - maybe. My question is, if we are hopping around at layer 3 already, would MPLS markings still be seen or matter by AT&Ts underlay somewhere? Even with just the basic GRE traffic, I’d figure that qos markings would be copied over maintained? Right now, I think the profile not being set as being the problem / waste.\n At a higher level to this, it seems like there’s a possibility that whoever architected the design so that we control L3, traded off the QoS perk gained from MPLS.

But. \n I have engagement (tehe) with a vendor on a project recently. They provide SaaS for my company. We are trying to stand up a new site to site. Problem is we don't see the tunnel (policy based) come up. My next steps were to do an embedded pcap as I am not seeing any traffic from the host at the firewall. I send an email to the vendor saying I see no traffic each time we test... but then after I explicitly point at the host in one of my emails we see an icmp request come across the fw about an hour later. Following I get an email from their pm asking me to explain steps I see in the network and they are requesting an additional resource to look at our network. \n Now the question. And don't get me wrong, this is indeed ego related, but my ego isnt that big (is it?). \n Previously when setting up the site to site, I worked with a respectable sounding network engineer. Would it be wrong to reach out to him and ask him what the hell? (Respectfully.) The problem is that the traffic never leaves the host. We have routes out and they proved it via ping. \n TLDR: I want to hear about times that you all took back alleys to get things accomplished.

Every day around the same time, one of our sites' (public high school) bandwidth drops to nothing for about 15 minutes. I ran iperf tests on repeat and logged the output across the WAN to the site and I was getting around 1.8Gbits/s on a 2Gbits/s connection. Right around the time the students leave the bandwidth tanked in iperf (just across the WAN to the DC) and on speedtest.net to 30Mbits/s for between 5 and 15 minutes. Seems to happen each day around that time and then just clears up.\n I have smokeping running and that looks clean and never shows a change. I don't drop regular ping packets but if I run a faster fping I do see between 1%-4% packet loss around that time. Interfaces on my router are clear. Nothing in the logs of the routers on either side. Something tells me it's the WAN provider but I am out of ideas on what to test or how to prove the issue further. I plan on reaching out to them tomorrow to see if they can seen anything on their side but I know that will be tough to get them to research it.

          "description": "Hi all,\n I'm in the process of replacing the firewalls at our main site as well as our DR site and had a question as to what the best way to setup SSL VPN connections for our users would be. The current setup is non-existent in that my predecessor never did any SSL VPN config on the DR firewall (I don't know how they thought that was going to work in a disaster).\n Each site is going to have a pair of Palo Alto 3410s in active/passive HA. I'd like to try to avoid having to setup each user with 2 different SSL VPN configs (one for normal use and one for DR use) and the only way of doing this that comes to mind immediately would be for me to have a virtual firewall in the cloud that I use to terminate all of the client SSL VPN connections to and then have a site to site VPN between that firewall and both the production site and the DR site. With that setup, in a DR scenario I wouldn't have to touch the SSL VPN config, just route the traffic from the virtual firewall to the DR site rather than the main site. Obviously this would require extra licensing for the virtual firewall and increases complexity but I'm thinking it might be worth it to not have to setup every user with multiple SSL VPN configs and explain to them to use the DR one in a DR scenario.\n I don't have much experience with SSL VPN configs on Palo Alto firewalls yet, so if there is an easier or more efficient way to achieve this please feel free to suggest.

Ideally it lets us also choose whatever carrier has best signal instead of being locked to the carrier we bought the sim from.\n I was looking at Twiliio, and the platform is just super cool, but we're not large enough for them to be interested in giving us a better rate.

I have the above Nexus layer 3 switch with a 1G ethernet transceiver and a CATx cable around 20m length plugged to an HP laptop also with an onboard ethernet port, auto-speed/duplex at both ends. The problem is that despite both ends being logically active, the link reports as not connected, when both ends are then physically connected. Bring down and bring back up the port on the Laptop (Windows Networking disable/enable) everything springs into life. Same symptoms observed plugging into another network device, although in that case, no option exists to manually down/up the interface (cheap IP cam) Plug the same devices and the cable into another switch, different brand but same logical configuration - it all comes up first time.

The idea is to provide free wifi to roughly 60-100 sites (read homes) that will be equipped with a low-cost router enabling several family members to connect to.\n There's been some back and forth on what equipment to use, but I was hoping that there was a best-practices standard that we could fall back on. Reliability, affordability, and ease of maintenance are the three top priorities (in that order) for this project. It will be really hard to service the APs and routers hooked up to the local fiber network that will be provided by a telco.\n The idea is to set up \"smart\" poles that will be used to mount the APs as well as all of the grounding equipment etc.\n Thanks again for any and all advice -- we will most likely need to contract this out but I wanted to check with this sub first just to get a general idea of min/max including projected costs.\n    submitted by    /u/sksksjhdjajss  \n [link]   [comments]",

The current method of listening to these devices is to connect them all to a large hub and listen on whichever computer I’m using to record the data. Processing is done as data arrives, etc. This is manageable, but undesirable for a couple reasons:\n  \nOnly one PC can listen at a time\n \nTo reduce bandwidth cost, the devices do not report human-readable data. Rather, the host is responsible for deserializing/parsing the data as it’s streamed though\n \n Solution: Have a single server computer dedicated to listening to the serial streams, parsing, then passing the stream to clients around the network in a more desirable format. Extending this, I suppose there could be multiple “sub” servers forwarding to a main server which distributes to whoever is listening, but I’m not going to bother with that at the moment. \n My question(s) to you: \n  \nIs this worth pursuing? At its core, all I’m doing is forwarding usb bits to the network and moving the parsing work to a different computer. At the moment, a single computer solution is working just fine, if annoying. \n \nHas anyone done anything like this? \n \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/SquiDoge  \n [link]   [comments]",

Shaw called me last month and said our router is pulling too many IPs (~500) when we are only assigned 5. Nothing has changed in our configuration that would have caused this - I have literally not touched this client's network in over a year.\n So, checking their settings from the ISP, looks like:\n WAN IP: 1.2.3.200\n Subnet: 255.255.254.0\n Gateway: 1.2.3.1\n We are assigned the static IPs .200-.204\n Right off the bat, I'm thinking - there are your 500 IPs, its just getting everything on the subnet they gave me. Due to the gateway address, I can't make it smaller than 255.255.255.0. When I make that change, guess what? Now there's only 200-something IPs being pulled. They swear the original settings are correct.\n When I look in the SonicWall logs, I see lots of \"failed TCP packets\" from some China IP with a destination of another IP on the subnet that is not in our block of static IPs (lets say it is 1.2.3.50). Is there something configured in the SonicWall that is doing this?\n I told Shaw that their equipment should be restricting the IPs to whatever they give us, and its not my fault/problem. They came and replaced their modem today and it still has the same problem - pulling way too many IPs. Their next step is they want me to factory reset the SonicWall and set it up from scratch - no way am I doing that!\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/RainyNetAdmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm in the process of evaluating some access layer switch replacements for the SMB I work at. Here is what I'm having a hard time deciding: \n I am looking at either Cisco C1000 or Aruba CX6000 48 and 24 port PoE switches. Supply chain is like everything else right now and lackluster at best. They are also getting pretty expensive. \n I can find \"previously loved\"/refurb Aruba 2530 or Cisco 3750X 48 and 24 port PoE switches that support our requirements for about 1/5 to 1/3 of the cost from a reputable supplier. Cisco 3750X is out of support and the 2530 will be soon, so no critical vulnerability patches when/if they happen. \n Our perimeter will be secured with either Fortigate or Palo Alto and proper segmented network design, and these switches will sit only on the access layer. \n What I'm struggling with is justifying the HUGE jump in price to go brand new. Yes, I realize it could prevent a potential failure, but these are also Cisco and Aruba switches that will most likely last 10-15 years without issue which has been my experience with both brands. If one fails, I can stock 3 in its place and still come out ahead. \n Curious what the consensus is on missing out on vulnerability patches on switches that are at the access layer? Judging from other threads it's a mixed bag, but thought I'd see what kind of discussion comes up! \n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/aarondavis87  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm self-taught in SQL and Server admin, and the guy that had previously setup the network I'm working on is out on medical leave (not expected back before go-live). \n We're a small company, that recently decided to open a second location several states away from our current. Our current network is a 10.10.x/23 setup, with 1-79 reserved for static devices (servers, switches, printers, network connected manufacturing devices), and the rest as DHCP for internal and guest networks. We're very close to our 512 address limit. Our new location is expected to roughly need 20 more static addresses, and peak around 100 DHCP between internal and guest. My initial thought was to use the same DHCP host, expand the subnet to a 10.10.x/21, block of a larger range for statics, and expand DHCP range for the rest. \n However, I get the impression that I can create the 2nd location network as it's own 10.10.x/24 range, and use DHCP Relay to enable communication without having to rework all of the local stuff. That should just require some changes to the initial DHCP, and DNS, but otherwise will all be configurable on the Firewall at location2?\n ​\n So in things needing adjusted in Loc1 (ex. 10.10.100/23)\n -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)\n -DHCP Host\n -DNS Host\n -rest of the network is no-change\n Loc2 (ex 10.10.200/23)\n -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)\n -rest of the network is nothing extra to setup\n ​\n Is this best practice?

This endpoint is restricted in the firewall to a known Allowlist of customer FQDN and IP addresses. \n Orders from a particular customer stopped flowing this week. We reached out to the customer Tech Support for assistance, no response. After a backlog of about $200,000 worth of purchase orders had stacked up, I dug in.\n I knew that the customer's app was trying to make a connection and assumed they were hitting us from an unknown and disallowed IP address. Using Packet Capture and wireshark, I was able to sift though all of the Scans, bots, and other nasty traffic and ended up correlating inbound dropped packets to outbound confirmation requests (from other TCP streams initiated by us). The source and destination IPs were different, but both in Google Cloud.\n I took an educated guess and whitelisted an unknown IP Address and the orders started flowing again.\n Turns out the customer had migrated their services to Google Cloud and had not informed their downstream vendors of the change. \n I love this detective work, using wireshark to solve these kinds of mysteries and investigating what is otherwise \"invisible\".\n I'm a generalist - a mile wide and an inch deep but have recently developed a strong desire to specialize in networking or Cyber.

Before performing the upgrade we forgot to disable the NAT rules on the Fortigate which were running parallel with Palo Alto firewalls. \n During the upgrade firewalls failed over and the ARP table on our ISP gateway got updated with new ARP entries from Fortigate (GARP sent during HA failover). And users lost access to some of the servers NAT'ed on outside. Since we don't have access to the ISP gateway to clear ARP cache, we needed to contact the ISP support, unfortunately no one responded in a timely manner.\n So the situation is that we need to wait till the arp timer expires in the ISP gateway and we don't know how long it takes and we cannot afford a long outage. So we had to fix this issue asap without performing a failover or any changes in Palo Alto to trigger GARP. \n Then we found this command  test arp gratuitous ip <ip/netmask> interface <interface name>  which would manually trigger a GARP and it saved our day. It updated the upstream ISP gateway ARP tables. I know that we could do this in Cisco ASA and Firepower but wasn't aware that this is available in Palo.

I console into the switch and found the trunk link to be in err-disable, so I shut and unshut the port. The state changed to connected, and still no traffic getting through.\n The trunk that was working was 10G MMF fiber. I could still see the other switch via CDP, but no traffic getting through. I changed the SFP+ on both ends, and I was able to ping the other switch, but it was really bad. When I sent 100 pings to the other switch, it would timeout at random intervals. 80/100 success rate. The trunk link is at 10G full-duplex on both ends. \n I tried 1G SFP, and still no dice. The 1G SFP MMF states were down down. So I went back to SFP+.\n I swapped the fiber from orange to aqua, and it was worse. With aqua fiber, there is no traffic at all, but CDP is working. I changed ports and still no traffic. I swapped to copper, and the same - CDP is working, but no traffic getting through. \n The config on each port is the same. Upstream Switch (i think it is a 3850):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 nonegotiation  Downstream Switch (I think it is a 3750):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 Switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q nonegotiation  This whole time the 3850 led was green, but the 3750 was amber. Again, each link shows 10Gbps at full-duplex. I have rebooted both switches and only CDP is working. I'm hitting a wall at this point. What else could I do to troubleshoot this trunk link?\n    submitted by    /u/forwardslashroot  \n [link]   [comments]",

I run LACP on two ports, port 1 and port 2.\n Two NK9 switches are vPC pairs.\n The switches are pure layer 2, we run only layer 2 on the switches (only L2 VLANs). All the default gateways are configured in the firewalls.\n Internet terminated in the switches. I do NOT have two ISPs, it is only one ISP that provides us two circuits or two handoffs that terminates on my both switches. They (the ISP) run VRRP on the router so my internet next-hop or default gateway is the VIP. Basically, the internet connection (setup) is a QinQ where they handoff two transport VLANs.\n  \nThe MLAG…",

Our solar network needs to communicate to 192.168.0.100 to get data from their existing electrical infrastructure. Their 192.168.0.100 is not connected to the internet due to security reasons, it's literally got an unmnaged switch with no router even, we are allowed though to connect onto that network as long as their computer doesn't have any internet access. Secondly, we've got a TV in the entrance of the building displaying data from the solar for the clients to see, it's almost a 800m run so would rather want to utilise and try to work through their existing network, running a new cable is very hard due to access.\n I please need assistance on how to get traffic from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.5 without interfering with their existing network (not sure if it's called port forwarding?). Client has a network engineer on site but I'm getting the feeling he's not 100% sure how as nothing has been actioned yet, I can hopefully relay info from here to him and see if he finds a way.\n Then I please need assistance on how to get traffic to and from 192.168.0.100 from 192.168.2.2 , is it perhaps port forwarding on the Teltonika and Cisco side? And then setting up a firewall rule on the cisco side to not give internet access to 192.168.2.2?\n I can, going to be hard though, run a seperate cable from the Teltonika straight to the 192.168.0.100 network and then the 192.168.0.100 network is not going to be connected to the Cisco network at all, but then I'll need advise on how to set up on the Teltonika side to not give internet to 192.168.0.100 but still be able to access it.\n Thanks in advance for any assistance!\n    submitted by    /u/Beginning_Brief_534  \n [link]   [comments]",
