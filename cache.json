Typically, I rely on rsync for file transfers, but it's taking a considerable amount of time for calculations in this case. Therefore, I'm curious if there are better tools available for handling this massive task.Do you have any suggestions for alternative tools or techniques that can efficiently handle this transfer? I would greatly appreciate your insights!\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ReverendMalfoy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Reviewing the messages, it is pretty clear one of the vendors involved in the email process had been compromised. \n The email thread looks normal. The vendor requested and sent an invoice for payment on equipment.\n Two days later there was another follow up urging the payment quickly. The vendor also requested a change in ACH information. You can clearly see the email domain changed at this point and the language has the feel of poor translation. To me there were red flags at this point and had I been involved I would have urged a phone call to confirm the validity of the message.\n Another recipient on the thread from another company involved in this large purchase even doubled down on the payment request. Technically he was fooled too.\n So technically our systems were never compromised. But we are the victim since we made the false payment.\n Whose insurance gets involved here? I assume next step is to report this to the authorities. (local FBI cyber field office)\n Our company has traditionally not taken any of this seriously. I have managed to secure much of the infra a bit at a time with MFA, good AV and better policies. But my scope of oversight has never been able to influence finance and other at risk departments. Policies on ACH payments and convincing key departments to adopt things like password managers has been an uphill battle.\n Anyway, would not mind hearing how others navigated this.\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/bender-bender-bender  \n [link]   [comments]",

HR is impotent as they've said they don't want this happening but it continues. the VP above has made promises to 'put a stop to it' yet it continues. \n this is but one in a litany of examples of this toxic and abusive behavior, and an opportunity came up, so i took it. might recruit the rest of my team to come along...

I told them I don't agree with this approach and to get approval from the people signing the checks. \n I would like any opinions regarding the validity of their claims that 100 Sophos licenses are needed to make a Cloudberry backup of a NAS \"safe\" despite having already having Huntress and offering them 1 PC with Sophos to scan the SMB share.\n    submitted by    /u/BadAsianDriver  \n [link]   [comments]",

Cloud is not so simple. * Azure AD itself can't be restored, at least not with the same identities. If you lose control of a tenant, any identities are gone. And if you use Azure AD login and Intune with Bitlocker, your devices are all now wiped as well. Any configuration that depends on application configurations or managed identities needs to be rebuilt. Even UPNs wouldn't work, since you can't add the same domain onto a new tenant. * VMs in Azure can be backed up by any backup agent, but what about PaaS? If you're relying on Azure Backup/ Site Recovery, you just lost that too. Are there any good options for backing up files or blobs in Azure storage accounts? What about databases? Or Azure Key Vault? Azure Automation? * If you're using Azure services, you should be storing all your environment configuration in a code repository. But is it really all there? Have you tested a rebuild? And if you're using a cloud repository and logging in with Azure AD SSO, I have some bad news for you..... * For Office 365 data, much of it can be backed up, but can it be restored in a new tenant? Even tenant-to-tenant migrations with access to both tenants are spotty. In a new tenant, any identities are gone, and any permissions or groups would need to be rebuilt.\n Is there any product out there that claims to be able to restore your entire Azure estate, or should I just throw my hands up and hope it doesn't happen?\n    submitted by    /u/ProMSP  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n The scenario is: You’re upgrading the domain controller to a newer version of Windows Server for some new infrastructure requirements. All workstations are Windows. No Azure AD in place.\n The problem is: Some end users that will need to be migrated to the new domain work remotely (not down the street remotely, but sometimes a few states away remotely). These users connect to resources over VPN, but the VPN authentication is tied to the domain controller that is going to be decommissioned.\n At some point during the migration the authentication of VPN is going to have to be redirected to the new domain controller. What I’m trying to nail down is what’s the best way/best sequence of steps to get all the devices on the new domain with the wrinkle of VPN being tied to the old one?\n There’s only about 15 or so people I’m dealing with, not hundreds or thousands. So even if the process is a little tedious, that’s okay. One thing I thought about is just switching the VPN (temporarily) to authenticate using some other method besides VPN before the migration starts, but I’m trying to see what all my options are.\n TLDR: upgrading/replacing domain controller, some users are offsite so their devices would be joined over VPN, but VPN auth is tied to old domain/domain that is going away. Need to figure out optimal way to do the migration.\n Any thoughts or resources would be appreciated?\n    submitted by    /u/whoyagonnacall_IT  \n [link]   [comments]",

I probably want something automated that let's the service agent the ability to view the file and I guess I can audit this to a log file.. then I also need a DLP solution..\n I would love to hear your thoughts about that and how you think I should work with customers personal documents & store them.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/MadHackerTV  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to figure an issue out and usually my google is on point, but I can't for the life of me figure out where to start with the search. \n We have multiple scan workstations on windows that need fast access to a NAS, producing thousands of folders with images on a daily basis. Current setup is old, not compliant with what we should have. Single user for all pcs that has domain admin and thus way too many rights for what that pc actually needs. But if I use a user without domain admin rights, the folder access speed to the NAS goes down dramatically to the point that a folder containing e.g. 80k subfolders doesn't pull the list fast enough for our software to work, thus crashing the workflow. With domain admin the entire folder is listed in a second or two, without it takes minutes to list.\n I'm at a loss what exactly handles this kind of file access and thus far only found out that domain admin grants the access speed and it's my goal to remove domain admin from that setup.

At that time we announced our end of support for the old one, but our users wouldn't move their apps. They have a ton of reasons, but it mainly comes around priorities and money. Since the original announcement, they've had 2 chances to setup their budget for the year to include the migration but many teams have just not bothered. We've gotten little to no support from our leadership even though we've been hit with a huge, multimillion dollar cost to keep extending support and licensing. They know we're leaving and are stuck, so they can stick us on the way out.\n We've alerted everyone to the fact that we are no longer doing updates to the platform and any security vulnerabilities need to now be tagged against the teams who refuse to leave rather than ours. We've also notified everyone that support goes away at the end of this year, even though we're already so far behind that we aren't supported anyway.\n What else can we do? I'm expecting our leadership to expect a Hail Mary if there is a production impacting outage even though we're ending up so far out of support it'll be a nightmare to fix.

Some said yes, some said no, some just left it.\n None of them can access the server by server name \\\\server2 and of course they only app they use accesses the server by server name.\n Did some testing, they can ping the server IP and it resolves, they can access the shares by IP address. Same thing is happening on the DC in this site. This also happens if they try to access a server by name in site 1. Everything in site 1 is fine by the way.\n Kerberos Event ID 4 is showing up on the server and the workstations. Did the suggested SPN duplicate search but didn't find any duplicates.\n What I did find was if I tried to ping the domain name it would return an IP address other than the server. It is actually just an IP address from the DHCP pool and not actually assigned to anything. This was happening on the server and the desktops.\n I went into DNS and removed that entry. At that point the server in site 2 started working and could access its own shares by name. Workstations could not so I rebooted them with no change. Rebooted server and it still works and so do a handful of the desktops. Some of the desktops still give the error and can't access by name.\n They give the same event id 4 in the event viewer with the name of whatever server we try to access.

Anyhow, these are the agents and apps that launch on every win 10 machine in our environment:\n  \nZscaler\n Rapid 7\n Crowdstrike\n Configuration manager (SCCM)\n Cisco anyconnect (Zscaler does the same Job)\n Lakeside software Systems Management Agent Systrack\n Jabra express (Headphone support software, but only half the company uses jabra headsets nowadays)\n Zoom\n Teams\n Citrix receiver (because why not)\n  \nI'm sure I missed one or 2 but its crazy to me. Does anyone else run these many agents or am I the crazy one for thinking its a bit much?\n    submitted by    /u/DJRob73  \n [link]   [comments]",

In theory, Windows Full Screen Kiosk Mode would be perfect, except for one thing - it doesn't allow to exit a PDF. Unfortunately, there's no way to bypass that. In theory, I could set up a Kiosk without Full Screen, but then I would have to block numerous websites, whereas with Full Screen, I set Intranet as the default page and people can't exit from it. Can you recommend any user-friendly and straightforward Kiosk apps for Windows?\n To be precise, I want the computer to be constantly running in Kiosk mode, and after a few minutes of inactivity, it should clear all data and return to the homepage. I have set the company's website as the homepage, and there is no way to navigate outside of it. You can only browse work-related news, log in to your profile to check your salary or remaining vacation days. And here lies the problem because employee data is generated in PDF format. The Kiosk with Edge easily opens the PDF, but there is no button to return to the previous page. One has to stand by the kiosk and wait for a few minutes until it clears the data and returns to the homepage.\n    submitted by    /u/Frexor93  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here are some practical tips:\n  \nOrganize cables: Proper cable management improves airflow by preventing obstructions. Use cable trays and ties to keep cables tidy. \n \nHot and cold aisle containment: Separate hot and cold airflow paths using physical barriers like curtains or panels. This enhances cooling efficiency and prevents recirculation. \n \nRack placement: Ensure sufficient space between racks to allow for proper airflow. Avoid clustering them too closely.\n \nBlanking panels: Cover empty rack spaces with blanking panels to optimize airflow and prevent recirculation of hot air. \n \nRegular maintenance: Clean or replace air filters, check fan operation, and perform regular maintenance to prevent dust accumulation and ensure proper cooling. \n \nVentilation options: Choose racks with perforated or mesh doors for better airflow. Consider adding fans or ventilation units if necessary. \n \nTemperature monitoring: Use environmental monitoring tools to track temperature and humidity levels. This helps identify areas needing additional cooling or adjustments.\n \n Remember to share your experiences and insights in the comments.

If we don't they will perform audit and eventually law suit which of course the business hotel will have to pay for according to Oracle.\n ​\n My brother is concerned and don't know what to do. They can't identify who did it on the network as people can bring personal computers or log onto the guest wifi.\n ​\n It says on their site \"By downloading, you agree to the terms and conditions of the respective license.\".The extension pack is under the PUEL which states that you are not allowed to use it for commercial use. Can he argue that it has not been used for commercial use as it was downloaded on personal PC's? Do they have a way to see how it's being used.

I built a model that offers unlimited free re-tests\n Scoping: I built an algorithm that automates most of the scoping process so now you can get quotes automatically for most standard projects. No need to wait days for a quote\n Reporting: I've created a system that generates the final reports immediately when the test is done, need to wait 10 working days for a final report..\n Crowd Testing: Some clients want several penetration testers to have a look at their targets but most pen testing companies can't accomedate that. With my setup, I can assign as much as 10 penetration testers to each project\n 24 Start: I've setup our penetration testers and team in a way that allows me to start a penetration test in 24 hours no matter the time of the year.

RDP is properly configured on both devices, and a login preset (Username: \"Win10\\Userguy\", password: \"3xample\") has been set up on Win11 to login on Win10. These credentials work when entered manually.\n Issue:\n When trying to RDP from Win11 into Win10 from a shortcut or selecting Win10 from the dropdown in the RDP interface, the login always fails and a window opens to enter login details. In the window the default user name reads \"Win11\\Userguy\" instead of \"Win10\\Userguy\", which then has to be entered manually again, and the right password. Which work fine. But even when saving these credentials, the next time the issue happens again.\n Edit:\n After doing a manual save of the preset, it now seems to properly save the username (\"Win10\\Userguy\") but the login still fails and I am dumped in the Windows Security dialogue (\"Your credentials did not work\") which asks me to enter the correct credentials. Now the default username reads \"Win10\\Userguy\" but if I just enter the password I am returned to the Windows Security dialogue (\"Your credentials did not work\"), and only after using \"More choices\" and entering the credentials again (username and password) does the login succeed.\n    submitted by    /u/get-derped  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's a decent spec machine with 64gb memory and 4 x SAS SSD (with the higher end RAID card) running Windows Server 2022 Std.\n The server feels really solid and quick when its running and setting it up we've had no issue. However at some unknown point it's started taking a crazy long time to boot, like 40 - 45 mins. It just sits on the spinning circles forever although you can access file shares on it during this time and some other functionality is working.\n I've checked the logs and a large number of the services seem to be timing out while starting. There doesn't seem to be a pattern though and they are all kinds of different services covering different things. When the server finally does boot, the following services are stopped:\n Distributed Transactions Coordinator\n Diagnostics Policy\n Network Access Policy \n But if you click to start them, they seem to startup without issue and once it finally loads it all runs without issue and seems 100% fine.\n The server has the Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, DHCP, File/Print and NAPS roles.\n It's an absolute nightmare to debug because I make a change then have to spend 45 mins waiting to see if it works. There doesn't seem to be any errors other than the services are just timing out with the error \"A timeout was reached while waiting for <service>.\n Anyone seen this before?\n    submitted by    /u/Soup_Roll  \n [link]   [comments]",

How it works is Domain Users grouo has access at Data Shares top level and all sub folders have inherited permissions. \n But now i want to make 5 secure folders. Do i just disable inhertiance on these 5 sub folders, remove DomainUsers group and add security group (with correct users in).\n I have access based enumeration on Data_Shares so it's going to hide the folders for anyone not in.

I've tried to do some configurations on Remotedesktopconnection window such as colour depth, bitmap caching etc but no success.

          "description": "Hello. Seeking opinions. I'll keep out some of the details to keep it short. I need to get a redundant/backup internet carrier at a very important site for our small/med enterprise. It is a warehouse location. The wrinkle is that we are leaving this site in approximately one year, but up until that time it is crucial that if one ISP dies another is available. Our current provider is actually the cable company, who has an enterprise fiber division. The only other provider in the building is the legacy RBOC who has fiber.\n I have been getting quotes through a telco broker who works with multiple different companies that use the RBOC as the last mile/loop, but they either refuse to quote 1 year or the pricing is very high (over $1000) even for speeds like 50 or 100Mb. I have looked at satellite internet services which seem too slow. I have looked at 5G broadband, but my hesitation is that they seem to offer no guarantee as to speed or performance. The fine print literally says there is no minimum speed. I need at least 50Mb up and down to run the business in the event of a failover. Another option is business (not enterprise) class cable modem, from the same provider as my current service. I inquired about redudnancy/separation between the two services, they did not get too deep into detail but admitted that they did potentially share some of the same equipment.\n So what would you do?\n A) Get the wireless broadband service, and hope it doesn't suck horribly when needed\n B) Get the cable modem and hope the services don't ever go down at the same time\n C) Bite the bullet and try to convince ownership that we should pay the $1000 per month for the backup service, which is more than we pay for our primary service. The internet in this location has not gone down for at least 5 years, but if it did and we didn't have a working backup it would definitely cost the company more than $12,000 if it was down for a day.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/moneydontjiggle4sure  \n [link]   [comments]",

From there, Axon generates an XML and JSON file and wants to place those files on our network for other users to access so they can open the XML file and enter in data from it.\n Our Network team said this was impossible as Axon does not have anything that would connect it to our provate network. Axon says as long as a PC has internet access they could drop the files on a SFTP server here if we give them a user account for it. Our network team still said it was impossible even doing that because our SFTP server is a linux server.\n Who is correct here?\n    submitted by    /u/voltagejim  \n [link]   [comments]",

(or an auto-detect feature built into the vpn client)\n ​\n What I was thinking was:\n  \nThe VPN client when connected would work as its supposed to with routing policies and things of that nature\n When the VPN client is not connected it would monitor traffic based on policies and rules and when it detects that the system is attempting to connect to a resource on the destination network that is only available through VPN it would prompt to connect\n The idea is that people would be able to stay off the VPN and only initiate a connection when its required.\n Further it would reduce IT helpdesk tickets because rather than logging an IT ticket when they can't access a resource, only to find they haven't connected to VPN, the client application would pop up with a notice \"looks like you're trying to connect to your workplace, would you like to connect?\"\n The user could click yes or no and if they click yes then it would initiate the connection sequence (prompt for password, mfa, etc.)\n  \n​\n what do you guys think? let me know in the comments\n    submitted by    /u/roblu001  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For those of you who had admined Teams phones, you'll know that even with autosign in there are times the devices sign out. Users press buttons, bad updates happen, or in some cases they just seem to randomly sign out. Every teams admin I've ever talked to usually starts by confidently saying they don't have that problem before coming back later in the conversation and saying something similar to \"Well we did have a few devices sign out but that was because the password expired\" or similar. \n If you're familiar with Kari's law the basic premise is that there can be no barrier whatsoever to dialing 911. If it's a phone, you should not have to dial an outside line or take any special action to dial. But if you look at a teams phone, every single one says \"Sign in to make an emergency call\"\n How is that legal? I genuinely do not understand how, or how people are getting around this. Surely if an organization is using teams as a phone system with physical phones they're non compliant with Kari's law? \n What am I missing? Even with auto sign in there isn't a way to 100% guarantee a phone wont get signed out. \n I get that there's other issues here that need to be addressed. The need for cellular backup in case the internet goes down, or backup power for the phone system. And yes, I fully understand 'most people just use their cellphones', but I'm specifically wanting to address teams phones in this context because the way I see it, there's no way to be compliant with Kari's law unless you have someone physically checking each and every phone multiple times a day, even if it's in the hallway rather than being assigned to a user.\n    submitted by    /u/breenisgreen  \n [link]   [comments]",

I setup an Azure VM for one of the offshore folks and was able to do a DB restore and push to Azure SQL for some mock data.\n Anyway, yeah that's about it at the moment. Happy to answer questions if I can without doxing myself and all that happy crap.\n Oh, and I will re-iterate from the last time, the outpouring of support from this community was amazing and I truly appreciated all the positive comments and good will. \n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/0110010001100010  \n [link]   [comments]",

The desktop I had to use only had one monitor so I had to keep switching between my local desktop and the remote desktop windows. A really annoying issue with this type of setup is using keyboard shortcuts (combinations) in windowed mode for remote desktop is the short cut (i.e. Window+R, Windows+E, etc...)would apply to the local desktop instead of the remote host.\n So I decided to take a look at the advanced settings for RDP and found a setting that I don't remember being there last time I looked (many years ago), and under \"Local Resources\" > \"Apply Windows key combinations\" was the solution to this annoying issue. There you can select the option to apply the keyboard shortcuts/combinations to the remote computer, instead of \"Only when using the full screen\".\n I figured I would share, because I mentioned this to some of my teammates and they didn't know about this setting either.\n Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the Gold award!\n    submitted by    /u/Need_no_Reddit_name  \n [link]   [comments]",

Banging my head against the wall because I am clearly missing something obvious.\n I have two ASAv's in different locations, both with the same split tunneling setup. We have a internet based service that we use OKTA for Authentication and recently implemented a CA policy to restrict out bound networks from accessing.\n What we have discovered is that Location A seems to show OKTA our DC Public IP, Location B it see's their personal public IP.\n If you have a corporate IP you are routed internally to an on-prem appliance to authenticate. This doesn't happen in the other location, you are simply blocked.\n If my route of traffic is to an external internet based application surely OKTA wouldn't see my corporate DC IP. So how on earth does it manage to?!\n Gosh please help, tried explaining this to OKTA and got nowhere,\n    submitted by    /u/UncleTooTall  \n [link]   [comments]",

All of them will require your (business) email and some other details to process the request, and some are more solid than others.

          "description": "\"Have you tried turning it off and on?\" is a common thing IT guys get made fun of for saying, but I mean we kind of deserve it. If it works, use it! I think it's funny that other professions ALSO turn it off and back on, they just don't want to call it that. Like once my mechanic told me to fix an issue with my car we needed to unplug the battery for an hour and then hook it back up. I said \"So ... turn it off and turn it back on?\" and he was like \"no, no, not like a computer\" and I just said \"suuuure.\"\n Well this weekend I learned a new one. Saturday evening my heart started racing for no reason. I put on my wife's FitBit and my heart rate was 124, well over the 80 it should have been. I ended up in the ER, and told me my heart was in AFib. Normally when you heart beats, the top part of your heart beats first, then the bottom part beats. In AFib the top part of your heart doesn't beat, it just kind of flutters. For me this meant the bottom part was beating much faster to try and compenstate. \n I had to have a procedure, and the doctor described it as \"We are going to put a tube down your throat to get a better view of your heart, then we are going to give you a drug that will stop your heart for a moment, then we will shock your heart to get it started again, and it should start beating normally.\" I said \"So... turn it off and turn it back on?\" He didn't know what to say so I said \"It's ok, I am very familar with this process.\" \n So there you have it fellow nerds. There is nothing that can't be fixed without turning it off and turning it back on.\n (FYI, the procedure went well and my heart is back to normal. Also I ordered a smart watch that can detect AFib.)\n    submitted by    /u/letowyn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Howdy folks,\n After about a year of asking for our manager and dept head to give us an actual policy of what on-call entails and not just \"work with the team to make sure any off-hours issues are resolved\", we finally have it in writing, and it sucks. \n We are expected to respond to all issues that come in 24 hours a day during the 7-day stretch we are on call. All issues have to be answered within the 0-2 hour SLA, including those reported by slack, jira ticket, email, and phone call. This is in addition to our normal 8 hour work day.\n The volume of calls generally isnt that bad (2-3 per day), but its the SLA bit thats chapping my rear a bit. To meet this expectation I'd have to set an alarm on my phone to wake up and check slack and Jira every 90 minutes or so. And on top of that we are to answer any helpdesk calls that come in regardless of time. \n Aside from the question of legality in my state (I'm asking a friend who is a lawyer about that), I wanted to get the opinion of folks on here. Is this even remotely normal/acceptable?\n    submitted by    /u/Ornery-Cap2009  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, \n It has recently occurred to me that part of job of IT and sysadmin is gaslighting users. Not intentionally. However over the years I have found that users will generally tell you a problem only for you to try it and it works. There have also been times where you make a change on the network, something you think won't be affected is affected and you undo that change. Instead of explaining the process of what you did (because either the user wont care or understand) you say, it's fixed. Or there have been instances when you kind of made a stupid mistake and instead of admit your mistake, you quietly undo the thing and the user is puzzled as to why it started working again. \n I have been in IT for about 15 years in numerous roles and still carry a passion for it. I will passionately explain things to people if they will listen. For some reason though, I have found due to the environment and nature of IT, people either don't take interest or done care so you are sometimes left to look like you just performed magic and it is now working. \n I am just wondering if anyone else feels the same.\n    submitted by    /u/zodiac200213  \n [link]   [comments]",

We have a user called Tim (not his real name) who's calendar seems to be causing some major problems for other user's Outlooks clients. When the other users have Tim's calendar added to their list of shared calendars, their Outlook grinds to a halt and uses 40% of the CPU and causes total system instability. Every 5 seconds or so, it says \"updating Tim's calendar\" in the bottom right before disappearing again. This continues constantly as it was affecting one user for over a week until they reported it.\n The only way to fix this is to remove Tim's calendar from their Outlook completely - simply unchecking the box to display it doesn't work.\n The weird part is not everybody who has Tim's calendar has this issue, it seems to be 3 users out of about 10 who need access to his calendar. But all users who have this issue have Tim's calendar in their Outlook, so I'm fairly certain the issue is actually to do with Tim's calendar rather than the user's outlook clients..\n So far I have tried; • Quick and full repairs of Office on both the user's and Tim's devices • New Outlook profiles for both Tim and affected users • Removing all offline and cached items from Tim's Outlook calendar • Checking Tim's calendar for any recurring meeting going for excessive lengths of time\n I'm honestly a bit lost as to what to try next so any suggestions are greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/bawta  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there a way to set up an out of office notification in the dashboard with the admin account as well ? \n 2.Sometimes it is also desired that another user simply takes care of the account of the sick user temporarily. The easiest solution would probably be to simply give the user the sick user's credentials...if we know them. Well, in Exchange it was comparatively simple: You simply gave the substitute access rights to the mailbox of the sick user and could then set up his account in Outlook, even without knowing his password. With Kerio I haven't found such a possibility yet. Is there such a possibility to give another user access to a mailbox ?\n    submitted by    /u/Affectionate_Union58  \n [link]   [comments]",

Things like if it were to masqueared as a onedrive shared file it looks legit. The ability to replicate things like O365 MiTM attacks and more complex attacks would be great.\n I trust pretty much all my users to spot the obvious low effort phish, but recently due to how public the business is we get a lot spear phishing. We stop 99% of them but have had a few incidents where people have clicked through onto them, and frankly for the ones that have gotten through the various filtering I don't blame them. They were good phish emails, branded up, using peoples names, and coming from legit domains it looks like our business would have dealings with leading to legit looking phish pages.\n    submitted by    /u/Trickshot1322  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is this legal?

He also works late nights, and seems like is happy to do so. How do you even deal with these type of people? How do you even support these environments? His boss seems to be fine that he is still doing late night events after so many years, and it's funny to me that for all the work they put in, not once on how to actually build out a team and delegate properly. ugh.\n Edit- I also want to add, that I also do late night maintenances, but I couldn’t make a maintenance event few weeks ago due to family gathering which they were aware about. Manager was upset that I couldn’t make the event hence the post\n    submitted by    /u/MindfulPlanter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've heard time and time again that the best-practice for monitoring tools is to only ever be alerted on things that require action from an actual person. \n I agree with that philosophy, it makes crystal clear sense. Here's the thing though: my workplace does not abide by that whatsoever, and it is intentional. \n I've been trying and failing to clean up our SCOM environment since like March. \n Every time I've approached my team and my boss about turning off an email alert that isn't actionable, I'm always met with \"no, leave that on, I'd rather get the email than turn it off\". \n Every single person on my team receives hundreds of non-actionable alerts every single day. If you need information from a specific timeframe, you check your email alerts. Right clicking and 'mark all as read' is an every day occurrence. \n Sending a message in Teams that says \"you're about to get bombarded by emails from what I'm working on, just ignore them\" is an every single day occurrence. \n When we patch, we get thousands of email alerts that we have to sort through the following Monday every month. \n I've tried telling my team that these alerts can be condensed into dashboards in SCOM where the information is just as accessible and your inbox stays clean. But they'd rather receive the emails. My boss is extremely clear on her stance that she'd rather get hundreds of non-actionable alerts per day and manually sort through them. \n Do other places actually not do that? I'm putting a lot of effort into learning how SCOM works and how we can organize the data from SCOM to not rely on constant email spam. But my workplace wants the comstant email spam and has instructed me not to get rid of it. \n Do you guys actually operate with the philosophy that emails should only be sent if an action is required?\n    submitted by    /u/AnarchyPigeon2020  \n [link]   [comments]",

As someone with no prior experience in this domain, the vast amount of information available can be quite overwhelming.\n Overall i'm looking for a not too expensive setup to monitor our racks with a motion sensor and camera. \n We rent multiple racks in different data centers, and our manager wants us to monitor these racks 24/7. The monitoring system needs to operate effectively in various environmental conditions, such as cold/hot temperatures and low/high light sources. Ideally, we'd like a camera to activate and record video on one of the rack's servers when motion is detected. Additionally, we plan to dedicate a VM to manage the camera(s). Our requirements are relatively straightforward; we primarily need a camera to record any access to our equipment. \n I've come across several recommendations from other sysadmins, with APC solutions being frequently mentioned. The NetBotz Camera Pod 165 appears to be a suitable camera option. However, I'm unsure if it can be used without a NetBotz rack monitor. I've also noticed suggestions for the Unifi camera solutions.\n Those solutions are extremely expensive for what we need to do. \n ​\n  \nWould it be possible to simply use a webcam managed by the VM ? \n  \n​\n  \nAre there good open-sourced project you experienced sysadmins are using for this particular use case scenarios ?\n  \n​\n  \nWhich camera / webcams would be best suited for simply monitoring access to our racks? \n  \n​\n I'm truly fresh out from school, we've done some image processing projects in python so maybe in the worse case I could improvise a cluncky script that launches everytime the VM boots up ?\n Apologies for the novice question, and I greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations you can provide.\n Best regards,\n Ben\n    submitted by    /u/Ben_TrotFox  \n [link]   [comments]",

So he does have a valid point, even if we have done everything possible to avoid this (separate network, server is only accessible indirectly, etc). \n So currently, we're running the backups manually (boot server, run backup, shut down server again) once a month or so.\n Now that our Veeam licenses are about to expire, we are considering not renewing the licenses and live without backups and rather rely on the various safety features in MS365.\n What would you guys do?\n    submitted by    /u/PaSha_no  \n [link]   [comments]",

It looks at sender domain, if the sender if outside the org, and dmarc=pass, dmarc=bestguesspass in the header of messages to determine if the message should bypass spam filtering. Now it appears it won't bypass spam filtering if the message is sent to more than one recipient, even if the rule is a match.

At my company, Head of IT has always encouraged me to grow. In my performance review last year, he said he wanted me in a sysadmin role by Fall of this year. My company offers a bonus/certification program that pays for and gives bonuses for passing certain exams. So I have been taking advantage of this program and getting the certs as others have done. Others have gotten these certs and no one has ever batted an eye about it. In the past 2 months, I have been doing a lot of studying and got 4 certs on our in our certification program. On the last 3, my boss has been really slow to respond about them and follow up with HR/Finance so I get the bonus. Now, after my last cert I got, he emailed me back quickly saying to stop getting certs for now and he needs to talk to the CTO about it. Someone on my team got the exact same certs and they were praised for it, but when I do I am told to stop? I am just trying to grow into the role that I want at this company and I am confused as to why he wants me to stop my growth. I mean I understand if he doesn't want people taking advantage of the bonuses and then leaving, but I have been with this company the entirety of my career in IT (I am young so not that many years). \n I understand I am in a unique situation and I don't know if other companies offer things like this. Any advice? Am I overthinking? Should I ask him about it? All feedback is welcome. Thanks for reading.\n Edit: I don’t believe that it is budget or cost related. There have been other people in the past who have gotten certifications that grant bonuses that are double mine, and they were encouraged to keep going. I am leaning more that it is him wanting to protect the company and from people getting a bunch and then leaving.\n    submitted by    /u/TeaBagu_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Secure Boot has been enabled by default for over a decade on most Windows PCs sold by companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, and others. PCs running Windows 11 must have it enabled to meet the software's system requirements.\n An attacker who successfully deployed BlackLotus on a targeted system could obtain complete control over the OS boot process—giving them “almost the same capabilities as firmware implants, but without having to overcome the multilevel SPI flash defenses…or the protections provided by hardware (like Intel Boot Guard),”\n https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/microsoft-patches-secure-boot-flaw-but-wont-enable-fix-by-default-until-early-2024/\n https://www.itbrew.com/stories/2023/05/26/the-first-ever-zero-day-to-fully-bypass-secure-boot-on-windows-may-take-until-2024-to-fix\n    submitted by    /u/jpc4stro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello reddit. Sometimes my coworkers make me feel crazy.\n Here's an example. I have been tasked with setting up a new server. Currently, a large amount of employees use software that relies on a server. We're planning on replacing the server. I was wanting to use DNS to point to the new server using the old server's name to avoid having to reconfigure a large number of computers and applications.\n My coworkers don't like the idea. They would like to update all the computers and applications instead. I'm concerned about missing some computers and having upset employees.\n In addition, I proposed that we could update all the applications with a new name for the server, but use something more generic than the servers name so that when we do this next time, we won't have this problem. My coworkers didn't like that either.\n Am I wrong? Do I need to rethink my strategies?\n    submitted by    /u/XavierKing  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the virtual chassis setup it means no chance of config differences between switches. Controller A of the SAN could go to Switch 1, and Controller B of the SAN could go to Switch 2, so full redundancy.\n The VM servers would have 4x ports per server - 2x of which would be for VM traffic and their associated VLANs, and 2x would be for the SAN traffic.

Now I know nothing about development really, at most I use powershell and cli etc. \n They’re going to bring in a product manager below me to assist in deciding what new features to target and speccing it out, so most of my day to day would be people management and escalation in terms of the dev team. The IT team is going to get an apprentice at the bottom end to help move people up to fill any gaps when I’m not doing my day to day. \n So two question’s really \n 1- has anyone managed a development team with minimal knowledge, and do you have any info or tips? 2- what would this role be called?

But I will also be installing and managing four new Windows 10 office PCs (HP Elitedesks)\n Can anyone please advise any best practices to help secure and manage these computers.

The folder created correctly.\n To create the folder, I'm using the path: User Configuration>Preferences>Windows Settings>Folders and created a folder here with the action being to Update.\n For files, User Configuration>Preferences>Windows Settings>Files.

          "description": "I'm inheriting an absurdly unmanaged environment of devices, somewhere around the 100 devices number and there is a large diversity from a couple of Win 3.1 and 2000 devices all the way up to w10. But most of the fleet is a mixture of w7 and w10 (enterprise). As well as the obligatory smattering of Linux devices here and there (mostly RHEL based). \n The environment is also an 'offline' environment, generally with no direct or proxy Internet access (though I could configure a proxy if absolutely needed to) I'm looking to start tidying up the fleet of...shit. and I've never actually been the one to stand up config tools like SCCM/configmgr, Ansible, Puppet etc. \n I don't really like the idea of SCCM due to cost the relatively small environment. So am considering tools like Ansible, Chef and Powershell DSC. \n I like the idea of PowershellDSC as most client endpoints already have the powershell required as well as the native powershell management. And the environment is primarily Windows.\n But it doesn't seem to be used my most people over other config tools.\n Ansible on the other hand seems to be almost the defacto option and is better supported in the community. \n I'm generally hoping for any feedback or opinions of the two options if anybody has experience of both?\n Another option could be Ansible for POSIX/*nix and DSC for Windows. But this seems like overkill\n    submitted by    /u/AlyssaAlyssum  \n [link]   [comments]",

They basically brought me in to get their systems upgraded, propose projects for development of their infrastructure, and conduct maintenance along with upgrades of software (along with helpdesk).\n There is a database (SQL Server) that is used for collecting sales information for customers. One of the upgrades I am going to be doing is upgrading the version of SQL Server being used along with the Windows Server version being used due to EOL of the server versions.\n Originally, I was going to be conducting the regular maintenance plan of getting software upgraded to latest versions along with some hardware upgrades.\n However, after analyzing the data in the database, I noticed issues that exist within the data itself, including redundancies, inconsistent data, and other issues with improperly built databases. My understanding is this is a database they've been using for years. Based on my experience so far, there have been issues they've had to deal with for a bit because of how the system is set up.\n Something I've been doing is looking at how their database is set up and recreating it using the database normalization techniques to reduce the issues we've been having (on a separate server of course). Along with this, I developed a web based application as a way to interact with this database. \n I presented my ideas to my supervisor regarding my work and showed what it's capable of. He seemed really interested in it and is going to be meeting with me to discuss it further.\n I've heard the horror stories of lower employees having their work stolen or credit taken by their supervisors.

I fully expected this to be a softball (I was hired on as a level one guy), and that my VP or anyone in our C suite would have posed this question at the beginning of our contract. \n My rep paused for a moment, knowing our situation with Intune, our current DC, etc. He basically said we might as well not even finish this call, and mentioned how little time we have. My heart sunk.\n Since starting at my company I have been trying to get us onto a more modern platform, one that is easier overall for our users.\n With all that being said, doing double MS e3 licenses for 7 months is a non starter for our leadership. \n Problem: we have ~650 PCs on old DC, most of which are remote and our VPN solution is a) sophos ssl b) not widely used\n My proposed plan: New DC: All new/current gen pcs are enrolled We redistribute devices on new domain Users continue to use old e3 resources on devices (office licenses) until we are ready to roll out name change and new tenant\n We have to be out of using our old name and tenant Jan 1\n My question: is there any easier way than this?\n Just about anything is on the table as long as I can tangibly point to a labor savings, and make it as easy on our users as possible.

For others though it is a real pain in the arse.\n We are going to the security info page to add an authentication method (Microsoft authenticator app). Once added we then enable passwordless phone sign-in. The app displays a two-digit number which is entered in and then the phone is registered. The app shows that passwordless sign-in is enabled. However, when a user tries to sign in for the first time, they receive a message stating 'something has gone wrong on our side'. \n Phone sign-in is then disabled and the user needs to re-enable phone sign-in to try again but this process seems to repeat after every login attempt, and we are unable to see why in the sign-in logs. \n Users have either a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license or a Microsoft 365 Business Standard + Azure Active Directory Premium P1 License. They are also put into an MFA enablement group which is linked to a CAP. As I stated at the beginning some users it works like a dream, with no obvious differences in user setup.

One function of that application is generating PDF reports generated in Crystal Reports from data in an MSSQL database. This is a fully automated process, no interaction required.\n At present the function calls an SQL query, gets a list of reports to generate, then starts generating them one at a time before 'printing' them to a PDF file with the file name changed. This function currently utilises PDF995 which is slow and at times unreliable.\n This application (currently 32-bit written in VB4) is about to get an update to .NET and as part of this transition we want to move away from PDF995 and to something else we can 'print' a PDF to and specify the output file name as part of the process.\n Wondering if anyone here has a similar set up or knows of one, and can recommend a replacement software product.

Thought that was the end of it, I periodically get this type of email from current or former vendors we do or have done business with in the past. I got a response with another email that had been CCed telling me to refer to the linked items for our licensing agreement and that this was not a sales email and the meeting and Audit are required.\n Apparently they haven't been doing audits the past seven years and now they're doing them again.\n We only have a small number of licensed users with the full adobe creative suite which is licensed through their portal user accounts, and each user has a single activated computer or laptop (marketing team members who do graphics or video editing).\n Has anyone been able to professionally and politely tell these guys to go pound sand?\n I didn't care much for the prickly response from them. Had they worded their original email different and told me it was time for a mandatory audit to begin with I would have responded accordingly.

This one and the main server are connected to a managed switch and both systems are in the same vlan. We have this setup at two different locations, only using different parts.\n At one of the locations, we discovered that network speed in that vlan slows down drastically when the backup server is shut down. After a lot more testing, we found out that this problem occurs with any NIC that is connected in 10Mb/s mode (tested 3 different systems, turned on and off, and manual 10Mb/s and 1000Mb/s mode, both full and half duplex, same problem every time). It's a KGS-1604 switch from KTI Networks. At the other location, using a TL-SG108E from TP-Link, we couldn't reproduce that behaviour.\n Sure, we could just replace the switch, but we're just some 10th graders from Germany, doing some tech stuff mostly for fun and getting some knowledge in IT along the way, therefore we don't exactly have a lot of budget. Most of our hardware was gifted to us or bought very cheaply from neighbours.\n But even if this is not fixable, we would like to know how this could even be?\n ​\n EDIT: Yeah time to say goodbye to that piece of shit, thanks for your advice guys, guess I learned a lesson today: NOT to buy THAT old hardware, no matter how cheap it is.\n    submitted by    /u/Leonzockt_01  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm basically just a \"crusty old Cisco guy\" when you get right down to it. I'm likely older than a lot of folks on here (51) with about five years left before I can retire. I'm curious to know if anyone in my shoes has ever made the switch from IT to a \"real\" job? \n We have an Energy Manager position opening up later this summer. My degree (from 1993) is in Electrical Engineering. I've worked on enough Facilities projects over the years that I could likely put together a good enough functional resume to at least sit an interview. Honestly though, as weird as this sounds, I'm not sure what people outside IT really do? The thought of not being responsible 24x7x365 for umpteen thousands of end-users seems a bit surreal. Not thanklessly fielding after-hours calls, giving up PTO because of unexpected issues/projects, or measuring success with anything other than network uptime all seem like foreign concepts to me. \n If you've left IT after a substantial period, what were some of the things that surprised you?

I don't have experience working on a team this big. Which really sucks and shouldn't really be a factor. I have 11 years of IT/sysadmin and web dev experience.\n I've been a jack-of-all-trade type for about 9 years between two companies and my consulting on the side. I also have sales b2b experience for 4 of those years. I know how to pick up systems and processes really quickly and easily. I am currently teaching myself full stack development and cybersecurity concepts (since I want the CISSP by the end of the year). I have always been employed and am a good worker, yet these recruiters treat me like some unemployable person.\n The problem seems to be that I don't have a structured IT career progression and a lot of it is self taught. Mostly because I was the guy the incompetent managers hired to fix things. Yet somehow I am not getting this picture across to recruiters or they don't believe me when I say I work well with others. I know that there is some disconnect between my experience and what companies are looking for. I do believe it is the fact that I have never been in a company that was larger than 500 people. This seems to have hurt me in my job searches. Even though there was diversity, teamwork, irate end users and all that comes with any IT job.\n Is there any advice out there for a sysadmin who is looking to gain exposure to technologies at a large company? I am not dumb and I can handle sysadmin work, but why do the recruiters not want to hire you if you weren't in THAT specific industry? Using THEIR specific tech stack?\n Are they not understanding that the things I've done match their requirements (but on a smaller scale)?\n    submitted by    /u/moderatenerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything else is identical, even the email signatures. There was also about 10 other emails copied so at first glance it's not really noticeable. After reply this was followed up by we changed banks, plz see attached for new banking info and then accounting paid it...\n We use o365, mfa is enabled and we even do semi-annual training with knowbe4 to be aware of this type of stuff. Now IT is being asked to investigate but honestly there's not really much we can do from here. The spoofed domain was recently registered and all the mail records are setup correctly so it slipped by all the scanners. Email also had a warning in the body that we add to be cautious as this is coming from outside the company. \n Now we are wondering how a scammer intercepted the communication and was able to phish it. We've seized everyone's laptops that were involved and locked their accounts. So far nothing suspicious, no message rules, no unknown logins, no malware. We are wondering if it's on the vendors end but even if it is I don't think you can really hold them responsible\n I guess this is just a warning to ensure your user base is well-informed about phishing. If anyone has any tips let me know. They are already trying to reverse the transfer but it's been weeks since it went through. They didn't even know until the legit vendor followed up a month later and said the balance was still unpaid. \n Said vendor also isn't a small fry and is a multi-billion dollar global company.

          "description": "Hello Everyone,\n I am currently a Telecommunications technician at a data center and have been working on trying to move my career foreward. I think I am mostly looking for any ideas, tips and tricks, and/or a curriculum on how to best make the move into network engineering or a similar field. I love the trouble shooting part of my job but the long drives to my work place and the physical wear and tear on my body are starting to beat me down. I have an extremely strong knowledge on anything layer 1 and have been working on passing a JNCIA cert. However I feel that may be a waste of time. I am toying with the idea of reaching out to a recruiter and seeing what they could find me and see if any companies are willing to take on someone like me to train up. \n I was originally a fiber splicer technician working ISP and OSP, until I got my current job. However I feel my current title is very undescriptive of what is expected of me. I work closely with our in house Cloud, Neteng, and syseng teams and have picked up small bits of knowledge along the way. I've attempted to move into the department but management of my department has a hard time working well with others and is seeming to be blocking me. I would love to get work that can be WFH at least part of the time as I now have a one year old and want to be around more than I currently am. ( I work 5 days most of the time, 10 hours with 4-5 hours of travel depending on traffic. ) Any and all advice would be welcome. Thank you all so much. \n TLDR: Telecommunications technician with layer 1 experience looking to move into the Networking field. Looking for thoughts and opinions on how to make the move.\n    submitted by    /u/AllDaGouda  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I am a solo sysadmin for roughly 60 users across two sites and I am in the process of migrating all workstations from MacOS to Windows. Due to budget constraints, our migration is slow. We have ~80 workstations and started replacing one every month in July of last year. The reason this is relevant is that we are going to have a mix of MacOS and Windows for a while and processes can't just be switched over.\n Here are a few questions that I have and any advice would be greatly appreciated:\n  \nBecause the office is primarily Mac-based, domain administration tools (AD, GPO, etc.) have never really played a major role except for email (on-prem Exchange server). This gives me the perfect opportunity to rework the domain setup to my liking regarding policies and organization. How have you approached this in the past? \n \nSome of our users have only ever worked on a Mac so they would need training right from the basics on working with Windows. How have you handled user training on the new OS? Are there any good user guides out there that cover Windows 11 from the basics and would be easy to navigate for tech-illiterate users? \n \nDue to the sometimes huge process changes, I find that a lot of users will try to tweak the new processes to emulate their MacOS experience, often making their Windows experience a lot more complicated and increasing frustration. How have you helped users adopt new processes and help them see that the new processes, although different, are more efficient and will make it easier for them to do their job?\n \n I know this is a pretty lengthy post, but I really appreciate any responses to my above questions.\n    submitted by    /u/Altus-  \n [link]   [comments]",

Why cant I just setup each computer individually with local accounts? Going with a server is just overkill and its just consuming alot of power (and is also getting very warm in my office). The software that the server is providing with the other users basically just needs a visible-over-network folder.

          "description": "I've been tasked with investigating the options for on-call alerting software for my company.\n We already use incident.io to manage any incidents themselves, and track metrics and trigger alerts with DataDog, both of which are integrated into our Slack workspace to send messages to a custom channel. But neither currently support sending out either SMS or phone call alerts to an on-call engineer (and we can't wait to see if they are building it). If everything else was A+ I would accept app/push notifications, but using the mobile phone network is first choice.\n The reason I bring up those existing systems is because a lot of tools out there (PagerDuty, BetterUptime etc) cover a lot of the same bases as well as the on-call alerting, so we'd be paying a fair chunk of change for features we have no intention of using. I saw a recent blog post about PagerDuty alternatives, but from my reading many of the listed products are covering the incident management portion (like incident.io), but missing the actual alerting via SMS or phone call (out of hours, when we can't expect engineers to be paying attention to the work Slack).\n This needs to be a SaaS solution, because we want to be able to alert in the case that our entire platform on which all our own stuff is hosted is having issues. Given that we're entirely in AWS currently it also shouldn't go down if AWS has issues.\n What products are other people using? Would you particularly recommend or warn against using it, or is it just 'good enough'? Is there anything out there that really focuses on the callout schedule and actually calling people out, rather than all the rest of the management and tooling around that?\n    submitted by    /u/Carr0t  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Our company is in the process of rolling out MS Teams to the organization. The direction is currently to deploy a MS Team to each department and then use the underlying Sharepoint site that is created automatically for that Team and customize it as their department Sharepoint site. So the department would be able to use the MS Team for Teams functions and open/link to the Sharepoint side underneath for all their departments Sharepoint needs. The Sharepoint would have permissions customized for different libraries and would also have things like Meta tags customized, etc. \n Here is the kicker. Every event, training and MS rep I have ever spoken with has said the cardinal rule of Teams is you do not make customizations to the Sharepoint underlying a MS Team It is more of the engine underneath and you use Teams to drive the car; however, a new vendor we deal with contradicted that and said it is fine and using the underlying Sharepoint is the way to go. So I am doing somewhat of a sanity check. \n So I am trying to crowdsource some real world examples of if/when this will cause issues. My opinion is we should be spinning up a separate Sharepoint site for each department but if I am wrong I would like to know know as well so I can grow. \n I did some searching but couldn't find many concrete ways that utilizing and customizing the underlying Sharepoint site for a MS Team would cause issues/break things but I wanted to do my due diligence before we set out down this path if it is the wrong path.\n So I thought I would reach out to the community and see what everyone thought. \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/FinalSysAdmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

A fairly manual task but leads to the creation of the GPO settings locally on the DC of that child domain.\n Now, I'm working with multiple GPOs that are extended, which is nice but I'm not entirely sure if it's ideal. I can't recall where I have read that this is bad practice and I can't narrow down why but I came across this Microsoft AD Design Considerations and Best Practices article that indicates it's a normal thing to do.\n AD: Design Considerations and Best Practices\n Based on the Microsoft article and it being semi-recently updated, I'm assuming that extending GPOs across domains is a normal practice?\n I'm more curious about the performance impact.\n On one of my child domains, I search my sysvol\\child.domain\\policies folder for a UniqueID of a GPO that is extended and I do not find it. This means that the computers need to reach out to the parent root domain for that policy, correct?\n While when I search for a locally created GPO UniqueID within the child.domain\\policies folder, I find it obviously. \n ​\n Any ideas or thoughts on this approach in managing GPOs on multiple domains within the same forest?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/N01kyz  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey,\n I have multiple client users who have developed problems with network drives (DFS shares). The only thing that changed on their system was a forced W11 update (not my decision). Whenever a user opens a folder on the shared drive, it's extremely slow and crashes Explorer.exe after that, or it hangs in the \"Not Responding\" state. This behavior is present while in the office or with a VPN from their home network. This issue is not present for everyone, only for a handful of users.\n What I've checked and done:\n  \nChecked that network speeds are fine -> Everyone is getting 100+ Mbps up and down.\n \nChecked that system uptime is not crazy high.\n \nSFC and DISM returned no issues.\n \nCleared Explorer cache\n \nMade explorer run each window as a separate process.\n \nAll Windows updates are installed.\n \nAll \"Lenovo System Updates\" are installed.\n \nUnmapped all drives and remapped them again.\n \nMade sure that Defender are not scanning the network drives.\n \n The only thing that I've found out so far is that unmapping the drives fixes Explorer's slow speeds and crashes. These users rely heavily on these drives for their everyday work (Sharepoint migration is in the works but isn't going to be done soon).\n At this point I'm kinda out of ideas, can't even find anything to try. Does anyone know any fixes for this?\n    submitted by    /u/7gasyuasdbd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can only revert to the snapshot.\n When I revert to the snapshot I can work inside the VM until the crash happens again.\n It seems that before the crash there are no error logs in the Event Viewer.\n I think it could be the software installed inside this VM that triggers the crash but I cannot get proof.\n  \nEDIT\n  \nI created a local user joined to local admin group\n I was able to log in after the network crash\n I can see that under Control Panel there are no network cards, it does not matter how many network cards I add from VMware ESXi\n It seems like a driver issue, in Device Management I see a lot of unknown devices with warnings \n  \nAny ideas?\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/sbiriguda666  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Strange situation, though maybe not all that uncommon. I inherited an environment where previous admin had configured an Enterprise CA. We are in the process of removing all the servers from one of our locations and this CA is there. In the past, it seems this were used by local web apps for our organization. However, we have moved towards using another CA in another AD forest for our web apps as we are obligated to use the new CA in another forest. The only certificates that are currently active, non expired, and issued are our domain controllers. \n Can i go through the decommissioning and not transferring certificates to other AD Forest CA without disruption (i have no access to other CA)? Will this adversely affect our domain controllers? It seems like the domain controller certificates are elements to a Windows environment implementation and would not impact Windows Domain services, etc if I decomissioned properly.\n    submitted by    /u/asianclooney  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sorry if wrong sub please direct me to the right sub for this question then\n So basically I've been thinking about this and still don't quite get it. Take a standard Windows 10 Pro OS for example. If the BIOS isn't locked by a password, you just enter it and boot into a USB drive containing a Windows Password Recovery software and bam, you got access to the admin account since now you got the password to it. If the BIOS IS locked with a password, then you take out the CMOS for a minute, put it back in, now the BIOS has been reset and you can enter it again without any password, and now rinse and repeat what I've said earlier. If Bitlocker Pre-boot PIN is enabled, then you can just crack Bitlocker with a software like John The Ripper (but that's way more complicated than just using the software itself, there's many extra steps to it and it can take hours even, but I'm not going into that coz that'd take too much time and space). So Bitlocker doesn't protect someone from knowledgeable people like IT forensics (working for the police), a BIOS password also doesn't. Windows also includes a lot of telemetry by Microsoft by default, so if you're super paranoid, then again it's not a good OS.\n I could go on and on about the many different exploits of the Windows OS. Why do companies still use Windows Enterprise as the OS on their workstations (unless we're talking servers but here I'm not; I'm talking about the workstations employees use, on their company laptops etc)\n    submitted by    /u/Ill-Menu5401  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We are a Windows shop with about 4000 endpoints using SCCM. I needed to push out a .exe we received from a vendor (which puts files in the user’s AppData folder) to clients with a silent switch. I created a PS script to copy the .exe to the machine, run install and put a validation file on the C:/folder so SCCM can figure out if it has run or not. If I manually ‘Run Script’ for that machine it will work fine. I created a package to be able to create a schedule/required install and it always prompts for elevation when the endpoint tries to run the script. If I take that same script and copy it to the endpoint and try run it, it won’t run because the script is not remote signed. I am unable to set the execution to unsigned or bypass because we have the GPO set to only allow local scripts and remote signed. I’ve tried this as a domain admin and get the same result. We also have used the PSAppDeploy scripts before with no issue and those have stopped working too. I’m quite certain that the -bypass in the script is not working now either when it tries to run. We have been running this same setup for years and have not had this issue before. There is one code sign cert on the endpoints from ‘Microsoft’ that did expire a couple weeks ago but I don’t know where that came from or how to renew it. All the certs on the SCCM server are valid (but none of them are a code sign cert). We do have a CA and I’ve tried to create a code sign cert to push but I haven’t gotten that working yet.

My (custom) initramfs is build into the kernel which is signed and securely booted with my own PK in TPM.\n In the initramfs I have build tpm2-tools, dropbear and cryptsetup alike for decryption of the main rootFS, based on TPM2 PCRs/LUKS.\n Now in case any of the PCRs change the rootfs will not mount and I will be in a situation where I'll have to ssh in and decide if I want to accept any changes in the PCR registers and add a new unseal policy to allow luks decryption which more or less works fine.\n The challenge comes that I do not store dropbear ssh host keys in the initramfs, figuring they would be readable from the signed efi kernel by taking out the bootdisk and thus would allow mitm/decryption of my ssh session while manually logging in to fix the pcr/luks decription.\n This makes it so that I get the obvious warning that the host key changed everytime I ssh into initramfs.\n My thinking is there should be a way to get, or more likely generate, a fixed host key from TPM/PCR to feed to dropbear that would not live on the boot disk.\n Anyone have any suggestions how to do this? All TPM/ssh examples I find are for the easy solution to store client keys, not the host key...\n    submitted by    /u/Reindit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Have a few weeks of international travel coming up soon, and trying to see if there is a good way for me to just bring one laptop but isolate the company stuff and my personal stuff via dual boot.\n We have a company issued Lenovo laptop, fully managed by Microsoft Intune. I also have a personal Dell laptop, I can add that to my authorized device and access company resources.\n Brought two laptops last time I traveled and it was a PITA, hence wanting to bring only 1 laptop this time around, but want to make sure I isolate the company stuff and personal stuff completely.\n Thinking about the following options:\n 1. Bring company Lenovo, install a copy of Windows into a portable SSD, and boot from the portable SSD when I need to use it for personal. \n Pro is I can disconnect the SSD physically when I don't need my personal stuff to isolate it. \n Concern is if the company will be able to scan my personal data without me booting into the company copy of Windows(such as BIOS backdoor), and if it allow me to boot from portable SSD (this one I can test out).\n 2. Bring my Dell laptop, install a copy of Windows into portable SSD and add it to authorized device to access company resources.\n Pro is I think the company control for personal device is less than corporate issued device, or at least they claim it to be.\n Concern is my personal data will be in the internal SSD and they may scan it if I boot from portable SSD and not remove the internal SSD.\n 3. Bring my Dell laptop, install the company managed OS into internal drive, and install my personal OS into portable SSD.\n Probably the safer way, but more work and more PITA.\n ​\n Wonder what you think would be the best option in terms of data isolation from company IT admin perspective, appreciate any input you may have\n    submitted by    /u/osssssssx  \n [link]   [comments]",

When your ISP has a device that has either packet loss or high latency issues.\n Currently our ISP's device has higher than normal latency. It's a solid 70ms. I have tested pings from a few remote work buildings, my house and other tech houses. They are all the same. Every hop up to that point is low. Averaging below 20ms. But this last hop is always 70ms. It's the ISP's device in our building that connects to our firewall/router.\n Every trouble ticket we create with them goes nowhere. They say it's fine. It's fine for web traffic and stuff. But for VPN's that users run windows file copies over it sucks!

I get the impression this will go on ad-infimum until we are significantly more proactive in our defence.\n Obviously, this is not the forum for legal advice, but from a technological perspective has anyone experience of or alternatives to Domains tools Iris Detect to monitor for lookalike domains please? Indeed any other UK specific advice would be very welcome.\n Many thanks\n    submitted by    /u/MontyNotMarty  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of our customers (very large for our situation) insists that if we want to continue the collaboration we need to migrate the service to their servers (excuses about standards and regulations, middle management and users want to expand, IT is blocking us, senior management is labile). The problem is that we are afraid for our intellectual property, because their IT department (4x bigger than our whole company) is doing similar things to what we offer to the market. \n So I wonder, is it possible to encrypt a virtual server running on someone else's physical server in such a way that the owner of the physical server cannot bypass the protection?\n They run VMWare EXSi, we run HyperV, and my knowledge of VMware is quite limited, so a detailed explanation would be appreciated.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Silly_Style3589  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is it reasonable that they give us a \"hard no\" on this request?\n Background (if you want more details):\n Many of us prefer to work in a native Linux environment, but this is not authorized by our company. Since pretty much have free reign over our dev machines, some of us have installed Linux in dual boot. Others use a Linux bootable USB.\n These actions aren't authorized by IT, but so far, our local IT guys have been sympathetic and have adopted a \"don't ask, don't tell\" kind of attitude, which works for us.\n Many devs don't want to risk it, and use WSL. Most complain about it all day (stability, perf, etc..)\n We'd like to stop working in the shadows and get official authorization from our IT dept. We're wondering if they're just \"lazy/inept\", or if supporting Linux in a large company like this is prohibitively complex/expensive.\n Edited for typos\n    submitted by    /u/lonzino  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Upfront - I'm underwhelmed by antivirus and EDR providers. Perhaps I'm suffering from working in a small company (just 100 endpoints), so maybe the products are better than my experiences so far.\n We are with Cybereason, currently on NGAV but due to replace with EDR in September. The support has been awful. For example, Cybereason is currently detecting itself (coreminion.dll) as being Malware (https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/). But only on one machine. I've seen other examples of legit software flagged on a handful of our endpoints, but not on most. It's just so wildly inconsistent, despite everything being in the same policy group, updated, and so on.\n Crowdstrike - looked promising, but awful sales experience. I've been blunt about how our purchasing decisions are made (we have an annual budget - if it isn't in that, it's not happening) and given windows when it's good to speak (i.e. two months before I confirm my budget for next year!). This doesn't stop me being harassed by calls and emails, including one rather embarrassing \"My manager said I'm in trouble for giving you this price, but I can honour it if you buy now!\" call.\n Watchguard - support was absolutely appalling, and their Panda EDR client trashed our Linux laptops.\n So, two questions:\n  \nHave I just been unfortunate with Cybereason - are those on the EDR or MDR solution finding a more pleasant time. What is your feedback?\n Are AV providers just shitty, or is it because we're such a small account? Would we be better using a MSSP? I'm wary of MSSPs because I've worked for a few MSPs who have tried their hand at security, and I'd not trust them anywhere near our small estate.\n  \nI'd be grateful for thoughts.\n    submitted by    /u/MyCatHasLittlePawses  \n [link]   [comments]",

Colleague access 365 services from personal devices, we control access by in tune MEM. With additional policy’s around OS levels. Colleagues require to authenticate one a week with MFA. Would it be fair in saying on the day of the audit only devices that have accessed info on that week would be under scope? If so what testing do they actually under go. We allow iOS, andriod and windows devices to access info this way. \n Q2. The requirements are that os levels be up todate, but looking more in to requirements is it fair to say that andriod 11 would be complaint Os as this is still recieving support ?\n    submitted by    /u/Commercial_Dog4050  \n [link]   [comments]",

For the rest we use also windows laptops as well so we have a mix. We own a Citrix On-Prem server where the employees connect to their desktop via ICA/Receiver.\n Is there a way to re-install the license and associate it per device and not per user on the physical machine?

I recently got promoted from help desk, because 2 admins left.\n And here comes the fun part.\n All Managers are in DA group. There is a Local Admin policy but it is linked to whole domain. Admin rights are given using restricted groups policy.\n My plan to fix this mess is to create 3 groups. Workstation admins, Developers, Server admins. Also 3 policies one to link to workstations OU, second also to workstations (but restrict it to apply only to developers Desktops) and third to server OU.\n I will create separate accounts for administration and add them to groups.\n Workstation admins will be 2 of our helpdesk guys, I will also give them righs to add PC to domain.\n Developers will be all Developers (don't ask me why, they cry to the management if they don't get admin rights. And they love them more since they make money)\n Server admins will be me, 1 colleague and CEO\n And I will leave only Domain Administrator in DA group and restrict access to all machines except Domain Controllers.\n First question is do you think that this plan is good? Do you have any other advice?\n Second question is, since a lot of members of DA group and Local Admin group are already logged in to some Workstations and Servers, and they won't lose admin access on those machines untill I restart them. What is a best way to remove them without reboot, but also apply new policies?\n    submitted by    /u/crippledchameleon  \n [link]   [comments]",

They want me to go look in the system and see if it ever left Exchange. They had sent it the week before, closed up shop and went on vacation.\n Check Exchange, and sure enough it did not go through on the day in question, but on the day they called me. So it looks like it didn't leave the mailbox, went into outgoing, they prematurely closed up the machine before it sent and went home. I explain this to them, and they tell me that because they use a Mac, and heard the \"Swoosh\" sound, they knew it sent.\n Wrong. I have the proof that it didn't send. Here's the proof.\n Not good enough, they had me expand the parameters, check the system again, so I did. I humored them. It's then that I notice that the email had a second recipient: The sender.\n \"Did you CC yourself in the email as well?\"\n \"Yes Mikash33, I did.\"\n \"I see. Did you receive the email before today?\"\n \"No, I didn't.\"\n \"OK, so think about that for a moment; You sent this very important email to them and yourself, didn't get your copy, and didn't think to check if it sent until a week later?\"\n Silence on the phone.

Looking back I was glad to have been there \"during the good times\" and was sad to see newer, younger coworkers not even have the frame of reference to understand just how much they were getting screwed and commoditized despite not actually being commodities. \n In hindsight some of the primary reasons the company got away with it was their \"thousand small cuts over time\" approach, and the total failure of employees, especially the older and more senior ones, to collectively push back in an organized fashion. I'm not saying to Unionize (and I'm not saying not to, either), but it's clear that todays Fortune 500 companies operate under the exploit and push until something breaks model of staffing and operations, just as they do with most everything else. And if you're quiet and kill yourself to make moving that goalpost successful for the company, then it will probably be at your expense.\n    submitted by    /u/systemfrown  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried every report feature in the application itself and I would like to know if there are more columns possible if I for example use the PowerBi Interface ?

RDBroker shows this is also the case.\n I can see in our RMM system they have more than 1 workstation. PC in office and laptop for remote working.

November last year even after an SSD and ram upgrade to 8GB (from 4) still struggling with cpu. I've had to turn off noise filtering a little while ago in teams to make it usable during long meetings. I have an email trail since November asking for a new laptop screen and dock stating the reasons and its been stalled ever since, every meeting catchup with manager there's a different excuse or blame on the further delayed merger talks. Latest is I've got a complaint on background noise in meetings which I argued I can't switch on teams noise filtering due to ongoing cpu usage. Told to move my office at home or tell my family to be more quiet. I'm at my wits end and looking for a new role as my boss is a cow. Today's advice from manager was to create a work profile on my personal laptop, as we all need to make personal sacrifices.

We tried it from both sides and its the same issue. Did the direct connect mess up somehow? is it a onedrive app issue? We tried all the usual stuff like reinstalling the onedrive app to the latest version, cleaning the cache, even new installs of windows, we tried different users and new/old groups/channels.

To streamline this process, I've put together a PowerShell script that automates it.\n Here's an overview of the script's functions:\n Creates an MDM Key: The script generates an MDM key if it doesn't already exist.\n Enables Automatic MDM Enrollment: It sets up automatic MDM enrollment using Azure AD credentials.\n Generates Necessary Registry Keys: These keys are essential for the enrollment process.\n Initiates Group Policy Update: It forces a group policy update using the gpupdate /force command.\n Defines Enrollment URLs: The script assigns the required MDM enrollment URLs.\n Automates Device Enrollment: It calls upon deviceenroller.exe to automatically enroll the device in MDM.\n You can find the full script here: https://github.com/fKryptek/Intune/blob/main/EnrollToIntune.ps1\n As with any script you find online, I highly recommend reviewing it, tailoring it to your needs, and testing it within a controlled environment before deploying it on a larger scale.\n I'm interested in hearing about your experiences with the script, as well as any modifications or improvements you might suggest. If you encounter any problems or have questions, please let me know.\n Looking forward to your feedback.\n If you'd like to buy me a coffee for my efforts : https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bobbyhalford\n P.S.: Keep in mind, the effectiveness of this script may vary based on your Azure AD and Intune setup. Always customize and test in your own environment.\n    submitted by    /u/kryptekgfx  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We've been using Lansweeper for 5 years now, apart from the Helpdesk lacking many features and possibilitys and the mail notifications being a bit unreliable, it did it's job for a relatively low price. Asset Management was also not the greatest, but it was on Premise and again, did it's job \"good enough\". Deployments were always a bit messy. \n With the recent changes Lansweeper made to their licensing structure, we are definately not going to pay premium for a Cloud Solution that doesn't do much better in the other reagards. \n So basically: Are there any alternatives? \n Price doesn't play that much of a role anymore, things have changed considerably and the IT-Budget got a pretty heavy bump (although it's still not absolutely massive and we are still only 4 people in the Team, so it has to be something that's relatively easy to learn...)\n Main point is: It has to be On-Prem. ITAM with connected Helpdesk would be something very nice as well. All i have found was ManageEngine, but i've not found any user stories about it :D \n Any help would be appriciented - thanks! :)\n    submitted by    /u/nexusband  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TL/DR: Foster kid’s charity collecting laptops to rebuild for foster kids, tax write off given for computer donations \n Hi folks, \n I replied to a post here a while ago about how I collect laptops and rebuild them for foster kids and families in Denver, Colorado, USA. I had a lot of private messages sent to me asking how to help but haven’t been able to post till now. \n I have been in IT officially for about 6 years now and after I had one foster child who kept punching my laptop when he got mad at a game, I thought that maybe other foster families had this same issue and needed a repaired laptop or a laptop for the kids. I worked with my office building and started collecting any desktop/laptops that were in the basement Tom be recycled, made about 100 systems - then the pandemic hit and the demand went up. \n I’ve been able to rebuild about 400+ laptops on my own (windows, Mac, a few Ubuntu set ups) and distribute them - but we’re running low and the need keeps growing. \n If anyone wants to unload systems for tax credit through a registered 501c3, we can accept donations and send you a blank form for tax write offs, and even make a post thanking you on linked in for free marketing. The goal is that you and your company win, and the kids win. \n Though I expose my identity a bit doing this, here is a LinkedIn link where you can search the history of this charity I run and who I partner with to know it’s legit. \n https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timlindow_denverbusiness-itadmin-itservices-activity-7043686634428530688-hFTT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios\n No pressure, but if you can help, there are lots of foster kids and families in our area who could use these!\n    submitted by    /u/Just-one-more-Dad  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a systems admin for a medium-sized org, and not super familiar with AWS, but wanting to know actual best practices for the scenario below. Please forgive the inexperience behind the question:\n Basically, our Dev team is moving a lot of dependencies for their apps away from local resources and more into our cloud environment. Currently, our media team writes directly to an on-prem FTP server and the dev team pulls the data from the FTP server and loads it into an S3 bucket. We have an application that pulls the content from the S3 bucket (as far as I'm aware). \n Our lead dev asked if there was a way to connect our local network to an S3 bucket in AWS so that we can have our media team write their stuff directly to the S3 bucket rather than the local FTP server. I'm more familiar with Azure, so I had to do some digging as to how to make this happen. My initial thought is setting up a VPN to our VPC in AWS, but I may be way off on that. However, our IT Director is on an 8-week leave, and from a strategy perspective, I'm not sure if I'm the right person to make the call, as I'm still fairly new to the org.\n From what I've researched, there is a way to mount an S3 bucket to a local Linux server. My understanding is that the local host would act as a proxy that would eliminate the need to manually move the content into the S3 bucket.\n Am I off on this? For those who have had a similar scenario, could you please share what you did? Telling the dev team to kick rocks until our director gets back to have a more broad design discussion is not out of the question, but I figured I would do my homework before I did so.\n    submitted by    /u/mxbrpe  \n [link]   [comments]",

If I had one laptop to use with the dock, I could have kept the port as untagged. I have the latest firmware on the dock along with drivers on both laptops.\n Previously i was using USB c dock and was able to use the feature without any issue. Any idea what can be the issue? Hopefully its not the dock, contains realtek ethernet port.\n    submitted by    /u/kan84  \n [link]   [comments]",

Reboot the server - Sometimes the server will go through in percentages so let it be till it's completed, it can take 5 or 10 minutes 3. Try installing .Net Framework again - Upon a reboot, Windows will indicate with a \"We couldn't complete the updates\" message that it couldn't install the update but it will continue installing it anyway 4.

I don't really mind if it's consumer, the Orbi experience is very consumer despite being marketed to businesses. Wifi is secondary to ethernet in our offices, I just want a system that doesn't require frequent manual interventions.\n    submitted by    /u/Otherwise-Athlete158  \n [link]   [comments]",

We had the issue this morning with someone who didn't have access since we couldn't properly re-inherit the permissions to the subfolders.\n The issue was that some folders were owned by User A, Creator of some subfolders, and not by User B, Owner of the Main shared folder.\n Normally it looks something like this. See picture below.\n Imgur Picture\n In my experience the Owner usually is the local Administrator or the group \"Domain Admin\". For now we have put \"Domain Users\" and we have added each user (not like on the picture) manually. Meaning that we don't yet work with an AD group that gets assigned to each user for access instead of each user is manually added.\n So my question is the following. Is it ok to leave \"Domain Users\" as owners or should be put \"Domain Admins\"? Is it maybe a security issue or cause other problems? It's been years since I've done it myself and I don't remember who I put as owner on those cases.\n    submitted by    /u/VarmintLP  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm getting onboarded to be the senior admin at a small company as the existing admin is set to retire soon. They sell software which basically consists of a desktop app (office workers) and a mobile app (field works) with a back end in SQL.\n Most all our customers are small as well without dedicated IT depts. So if a customer chooses, our company will host their SQL & Web Server in a cloud VM, give it a public IP, and let the mobile app and desktop apps connect there rather than the customer hosting it themselves.\n Last week, I was being shown how we buy and license SQL for a new implementation. The guy showed me we get SQL standard and enough CALs to cover each office user, plus one CAL to cover every mobile user, because the app connects to a web server first, then to the SQL server, so SQL would never know that there's multiple app users.\n Granted MS licensing is convoluted, but this is not how I understand CALs. Every mobile user, even though the app is connecting to a middleware, needs a CAL right? Yet this is how they've sold their software for the past few years.\n Not sure exactly what to do now that I've seen this? Bringing it to the attention of owners potentially puts a target on me as overstepping and being a threat to their business model? I'm not even sure how to bring something like this up. Usually big problems are things that are visible like failed hardware. Owners might say \"It works - I don't see the issue\" and I don't blame them - it's hard to understand.\n Fixing it and just eating the license cost could be difficult given this company's size. Re-quoting customers that have been live for years on our software telling them they're not compliant seems equally impossible. Yet this is my living and I kinda need the company to do well so that I can do well. I feel like I've walked into a time bomb that was impossible to see from the outside.\n    submitted by    /u/yinor62332  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I work for an MSP, with my title being Jr SysAdmin. It’s a completely unearned title, given that most of my day to day is typical help desk shenanigans, but my position is unique in that 90% of the company does remote work, 9.9% does on-site onboarding/infrastructure building, and I’m part of the 0.1% (as in ~3 people) who works on-site full time for a client.\n Well, the client wants to end the contract. CTO is a paranoid fuck and never wanted to give the keys up to any of his systems for us to work with, one of the reasons I was told is because I’m not part of their ethnoreligious group, so I’m considered an “outsider”. Fine, whatever. But everyone else at the client loves me. I get great customer feedback, my metrics are great, and even my supervisors are always singing my praises because of all the on-site techs they’ve sent in the past, I’m the only one who’s stuck around and been consistently good at the job.\n So the contract is up June 30th, and my company informed me that they won’t be keeping me on past that. They’re going to let me go despite a perfect record. I’m assuming it’s because I make $60k a year for what’s basically a glorified help desk, but I digress. \n I don’t know why I’m writing this to be honest, I’m just frustrated as hell. I’m a Marine Corps Reservist, so that makes finding a civilian job harder. This also comes right after I signed off on a new apartment, and I have 3 weeks worth of obligations family/military wise in August.

I feel like its very possible we may have layoffs coming next year and I know a lot of companies do layoffs by \"last in first out\"\n I feel like if I jumped jobs I could make way more money (like a lot more, probably 50% more), but not sure if that would open me up to less stability. I live in LCOL so while more money would def be nice, I'm not dying or anything. I also work 100% remote and am not open to anything not 100% remote. I feel like there isn't much room for advancement at current co, but the job is relatively chill most days and the benefits are good. Current co does offer decent severance also from what I've heard if layoffs did happen.\n I feel like I probably want to jump eventually but not sure if the timing is right. Would suck to change cos, then they announce massive layoffs and you're the first to be let go, since they just hired you.

There is a requirement to open up the guest Wi-Fi vlan to the mobile app servers in the internal segment to enable voice services.

Error Log for MSSQLSERVER said Event ID 18456: Login failed for ‘redacted’. Reason: “The account is currently locked out.

Some apps and vdirs use a UNC path to a share for their home directories and app passthrough won't work for not only those, but for the parents of those vdirs and apps.\n Our IIS configs have several root/parent apps and under those we have about a three dozen child apps and vdirs. About a half dozen app pools to silo worker processes for different apps and sites (balancing between performance and isolated memory space).

Adobe Acrobat Pro has improved significantly over the last few years with the addition of many new features, including:\n Liquid mode, which automatically reformats text, images, and tables for quick navigation and consumption on small screens.\n Integrations with Google Suite, Box, and Microsoft that enable customers to collaborate and make changes to PDFs directly from Microsoft Teams.\n Expansion to new surfaces that allow customers to access our PDF tools on the web and mobile.\n New e-signature features that streamline workflows and eliminate the need for in-person and “wet” signatures that can slow business down.*\n Reason 1 and 3 should not have been used as a reason. That is like saying, we changed the template on our website to HTML5 and it should look okay now on your phone.\n So at what point does the price gouging stop? It seems like were being charged for common updates.\n The e-signatures, I can understand. Fighting DocuSign. DocuSign can lick my butt. But something tells me this will be removed in the future from the Pro license and used as an add-on service. Like the way Microsoft tells you, any person can call in to your Teams meeting. But you need a conference bridge, and only after you pay for the conference license of $2.50 per user. That pools your minutes together.

Their environment has no structure that I can see, or at least it's very limited (a few VLANS and a domain). I'm new to running the show, and I would greatly appreciate any advice on where to begin to try to get this place in order.\n Most of the machines are on Windows 11 right now, with some of the servers on 2012 and some I'm not even sure of. We have a handful of legacy applications which require some *really* old software to run, and I'm hoping to sandbox all of that in a VM eventually.\n We have multiple different backup solutions, some of them local and some of them are cloud-based. All of that is automated already.\n I'm working on a hardware inventory, as what we had was woefully inadequate and so I'm not actually 100% certain of what's present beyond what I can walk around and see.\n Our server room is unsecured; Anyone can just walk right in with no fob and no swipe.\n We do have a corporate help desk from the company that purchased this location, but they primarily just manage purchasing decisions and provisioning.\n So, again, in terms of where to begin, right now I have my eyes firmly on the security of our server room and the hardware inventory, followed by getting hosts on some kind of naming convention and then the same for users... I'm sure there are a hundred more important things I could and should be thinking about, so please do feel free to shout at me what you think those are.\n ​\n Thank you!\n (For those of you who are rolling your eyes, please know that I already searched the sub for similar posts and have read through quite a few of them)\n    submitted by    /u/_Tock_  \n [link]   [comments]",

With lots of links, formulas, etc.\n The issue that is occurring seems primarily occur when accessing files larger then 1 or 2 MB.\n The issue being that when a larger excel file is accessed the windows file explorer (explorer.exe) will hang. Sometimes it will return to function within seconds, but it generally needs to be closed via task manager. \n It is replicable on multiple computers, so I do not think it is a local issue, and occurs both offsite on home internet, on onsite on our guaranteed 1000/1000 link, I had begun to think it was an IOPS issue but I can't find any reports on throttling in the azure monitoring.\n I am at a bit of a loss of where to go to from here, view the process and what it is waiting on in task manager when it is hanging gives me \"one or more thread of explorer.exe are waiting to finish network I/O\" as if explorer.exe has stopped communicating to the internet, but the file will finish downloading and launch. still.\n I am just absolutely confounded.

Since he was leaving, though, as well as the IT Director, I feared they would put me in charge of all of IT if I accepted, so I suggested a peer structure for the tech leads, which is what we went with.\n Fast forward a year and the interim IT Director leaves and they don’t replace him. Fast forward another year and they ask me to be the Director of IT as discussed in that previous post. I assessed what was needed, recommended they hire a director of IT with experience in IT management and tried to move on.\n A couple of months later they asked me to take over some temporary IT responsibilities while the main IT person was on vacation. A few months later they ask me to manage him. 🤦‍♂️ I again reiterated that they should hire an IT Director and that I would prefer to stay in software development, managing engineers.\n A couple of months later they laid me off as some in the previous thread predicted.\n I suppose the lesson in there could be to just do whatever job they ask you to do and suck it up, but the lesson to me is that I had it sniffed out for 3 years earlier where this was all headed.

As I said, I tried to search for that but I din't found any answer. So do you think guys this is a tipically practice in business ? Or it's a foolishness ? \n If that's true, how can I get info about that for document myself ?\n Thanks !\n    submitted by    /u/xurryto  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been studying, but after taking a practice exam... It isn't looking great. Based on my last job I'm confident in my abilities in practice, but the practice exam seemed very based on memorising minutiae instead. While the exam wasn't great, tons of grammar and spelling errors making it hard to parse, I do believe the types of questions are representative.\n I can continue to study but I'll end up going over budget, or I can pause this, start interviewing now without the cert, and hope for the best.\n Do you think there will be a significant difference between my offers with 3 years azure etc experience + 6 months break vs the same but with az-104 picked up in that time?

I also manage them. Little sub note: all devices that comes from our Hardware Provider are MDM managed all others are getting added by myself step by step you know its pain sometimes to get first all the Users Device Informations (Have to ask them). Since couple months it can get really busy almost max. of my cap thats why I wrote some more policies and telling the users to always using the IT Helpdesk if they have any Questions. Now I had a meeting were they ask me to write down my tasks I did last week and asked my about IT Outsourcing to Support me e.g as Backup when being Sick or on Vacation. I told them yes we can check out but I am not sure if this would be the solution In my opinion we should get another sysadmin there) I 'am also a bit scared about if maybe I get replaced after they Implement the IT Outsourcing since I worked a lot in the company and did a lot changes I would be really sad If something like that would happens.\n ​\n Somehow I feel since the Meeting not quite well, I always think about it.

          "description": "Hello,\n We are experiencing issues with a bunch of machines reverting their Version of Win10. It could be something else but as far as we found out, if one of our AD-Admins logs in to a computer where a normal User was logged in, the Win10 Version get's downgraded to Win10 Pro from Enterprise. Not a big deal at the moment but in our reports we're having like 100 Pro Versions now where there should be a solid 6k Enterprise. Funny thing is, when the User logs back in to his PC it takes ages to get it back to Enterprise by himself or the Azure Sync.\n Our Users have an MS E3 license. Admins don't have a license as of now. \n We already had a MS Ticket open and they provided us with the solution to just run a PS-script but we are still searching for the root cause to eliminate that. \n If we run slmgr /dlv we can see in the script host window that it's Win10 Pro and licensed but on the Win10 settings pane it says Win10 Enterprise, which is also strange.\n Anyone else having such issues? Or similar things? Have to be honest that the AD-Admin Accounts are just our first guess.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Cynric10  \n [link]   [comments]",

The web server for domain A was provided by my employer. Due to lack of staff, web server provisioning has been discontinued. We received a backup before the shutdown. The administration of domain A should remain with DFN.\n We then purchased Domain B from STRATO, including the web server. There we imported the backup and made the site available again.\n Domain A is well known by everyone and appears high up in Google. Therefore domain A should be redirected to domain B without an underlying web server. The support at DFN has entered the IP address of the web server of STRATO for domain A, which appears by a ping. However, STRATO can apparently not process this request, so that when the IP is called, simply a \"Not found\" appears.\n The support at DFN has no idea, and I do not know enough about the subject. He said that this is due to the configuration of the web server at STRATO.\n How do I get the problem solved?\n Thanks :)\n    submitted by    /u/diggerydigsby  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently my manager hinted that someone else applied internally and he seems to be a good fit as he got along well with my current team and that guy has been referred from top management. And he suggested if I would be okay to continue working for another 1 year contract. I felt bad and hurt as I invested in couple of certs in this job hoping my hard work and my certs would make me a good candidate once the position becomes full time. My manager told me he likes how I am always calm and thoughtful and he told me to think about his plan. I didn’t express my emotions or said anything when he told me this news.

It became a bigger problem and took down our CRM, SAP and SharePoint for 2 - 3 hours which resulted in slow and terrible analysis roughly 6 weeks ago. Decisions were made, thrown away and then decided again.\n During this time the team I am part of had the main issues because automations took ages / timed out since the FS wasn't always available or slow. \n Guess what we learned on Friday? We didn't create backups for the main share since end of April! Called in a contractor to go over everything and noticed bad sectors / partition starts corrupting. So tonight was supposed to be a full backup because we cannot risk anything, right???\n Well I told my team lead, who graciously got assigned on-call, that he should be prepared for dead scheduled tasks tomorrow morning or worse. He just send me a message \"10 people in a meeting - incl. head of infrastructure. Seemingly the partition died\"\n Well why have a call about a dead drive surely we deployed RAID XYZ? About that... Seems like we had 6TB of mission critical files on a single volume that was able to get completely corrupted by a single drive failure :) \n Sure I knew that most of my coworkers aren't topnotch but how in the devil's name is that possible?

Anything else I would be missing to ask about for a migration or gotchas?\n Luckily, the environment is small and simple but I would imagine the same solution would apply for small businesses of 50-100 employees but open to any easy work around as well.\n Thanks for your help and time as I greatly appreciate it!\n    submitted by    /u/deletejunkemail  \n [link]   [comments]",

I trust the mods will let me know.\n I'm trying to get some work out from underneath me a few weeks before it's due in order to free up my schedule and also because it would give me a considerably longer leash at work. What I'm trying to do is write out some SNMP monitoring rules for a Bosch IP camera, but I don't have access to the device yet in order to figure out what to monitor.\n We're using a really rudimentary SNMP monitoring system where you give it the OID and it monitors it for a response within the guidelines you give it. I wish we'd migrate to something more intelligent but you play the hand you're dealt.\n What I'd normally do is:\n  \nRun an SNMP walk on the device using its MIB (which I have)\n Confirm the MIB against the walk to make sure the numbers line up\n Strip out the stuff I can't monitor against/don't care about\n Make the monitor using the OIDs that remain\n  \nHere I don't have the device, all I have is the MIB. Looking at it, I can see that – for example – \"temp-sens\" is \"1.3.6.1.4.1.3967.1.1.7.1.1 \" , but that's only so useful to me because I can't tell from the MIB whether I should be expecting anything after this to denote the individual sensor (\".1.1\", for example).\n Loading the MIB into various freeware programs does not make this immediately apparently either.\n Is there any technowizardry I can do ahead of time to denote the various sensors on the device (or at least tell if the MIB expects them) or is the only true indication of a device's SNMP capabilities taken from inspecting the device itself?\n    submitted by    /u/ghoststart  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is a bit of a fuzzy line with devops nowadays, as well as X as code, plus scripting is a way of writing code as well.\n So where does sysadmin end, then? I often find myself adjusting or extending the source code of FOSS Software we use as well, is this still part of a sysadmin job or have I veered over into dev territory?\n We're a small team and there's not a whole lot in terms of automation. And obviously no devops since we don't have any devs. This, in combination with me being a junior/early in my career and also having had an interest in programming as a hobby has led to me feeling like I lack a proper frame of reference on what is normal for a modern sysadmin. It has also led to a severe case of double imposter syndrome as I feel like I am faking being a dev AND an admin while doing neither of the two properly.\n Are any of you in a similar position or want to share your thoughts? Should I specialise more or stick with my somewhat special \"stuck between worlds\" approach? I really love the way it makes me fit into my current team as it makes me feel like really having an impact by pushing us forward by automating and streamlining workflows. But at the same time I worry that it'll make it extremely hard to find a new job if I have to as other employers will likely look for some kind of specialist whereas I've cranked the generalist knob way past 11.\n Small disclaimer: I know that usually there's teams for different parts of sysadmin (networking, security, systems, etc) but as stated, we're small and just a handful of people so we have to wear several hats anyway.\n    submitted by    /u/AiPapi22  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR; Simulating a L2 Leaf Spine NW in GNS3 in preparation for a network re-architecture at work. The two spine switches seem to both forward any routed traffic. Can't figure out why, and was curious if anyone here encountered this before or know if its possibly a problem with GNS3 and wouldn't happen on real devices?\n More detail:\n Small network I am currently simulating in GNS3 to learn more about how to implement L2LS consists of 2 spine switches (VLT Pair), 1 standalone leaf switch, and 2 leaf switches that are a VLT pair. OOBM switch in place for VLT backuo links\n I have 2 VLANS i am using to test routing. On each leaf switch I have two docker containers connected to it on each vlan. I am not yet testing any kind of VLT port channel from leaf switches to \"server\" just single connections for now.\n LEAF1-P1 -> SPINE1-P1 LEAF1-P2 -> SPINE2-P1\n LEAF2-P1 -> SPINE1-P2 LEAF2-P2 -> SPINE2-P2 LEAF3-P1 -> SPINE1-P3 LEAF3-P2 -> SPINE2-P3\n SPINEX-P1 are in VLT-PC1 SPINEX-P2/3 are in VLT-PC2 LEAF2/3-P1/2 are in VLT-PC2\n VRRP setup on SPINEs with virtip 192.168.X.1\n On Leaf1 I have a docker container with IP 192.168.2.50 trying to ping the docker container on LEAF2 with IP 192.168.4.51\n When that happens I get 3 duplicate responses.\n Basically what is happening is that SPINE1 (the main VLT/VRRP) gets the packet to be forwarded from VLAN 2 to VLAN4, and routes it appropriately. SPINE1 then sends that packet over VLTi to SPINE2, and then SPINE2 ALSO routes and forwards that packet. So the 192.168.4.51 gets 2x ping request. THEN, the same kind of doubling occurs on the response back ending uo with 4 responses sent to 192.168.2.50.\n Has Anyone seen this before? Is this expected behavior and I am messing up by trying to do L3 routing in a L2LS Network? Im basically the only networking person on my program, so sadly I do not have any way to bounce ideas off a true netwrok engineer other than going to the internet\n    submitted by    /u/DawnOfThrowawayAcct  \n [link]   [comments]",

What are the cons in using VLANs (beside the limit of 1Gbps that I wish I could saturate with the Internet lines!)?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/andreape_x  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now, we have a nighthawk RAX70 router in the main building and that connects two outerbuildings, one with a nighthawk AC1900 & the other with netgear r6120 acting as AP's. \n What are the things I should take into consideration when looking for new routers and managed switches? I know I need gigabit ports. We have about 50 users spread out in these buildings that require reliable connection. I was looking into the Cisco router firewall plus gx50, but this does require a subscription. Also the Cisco 1000 series for the switches.\n    submitted by    /u/Administrative_Line3  \n [link]   [comments]",

This happens cross vlan, and even cross VRF - so on the whole router. We have isolated and can recreate and verify that the reason is a HDMI-to-IP AV device that is using broadcast. We can through inspection of the COPP control plane policy commands see that the router is dropping BROADCAST (Policier Queue 0) packets.\n I have to say I am a bit surprised to see the 9500 has default only 750pps rate limit for broadcast globally. How are people handling this and making sure bugged traffic, DoS or even just AVoIP devices doesn't stop DHCP relay from working \"globally\"?\n The traffic is not DHCP traffic, it's UDP 192.168.0.1->192.168.0.99, but the L2 destination is ffffff-ffffff. And port is not 67/68. I'm struggling to understand why the Cisco would even queue these packets for CPU handling?\n Anyway, I know I can rate limit the specific client and what not, but I want to know what is best practice for single users like this not killing a several 1000-user network..

Like the title says, we are trying to establish a 10gb link to another site via our ISP. The issue that we have run into is, our 10gb link is active and working, however we are only able to pass 2gb of traffic because all traffic going to the handoff device is coming from a single source mac address. Since it appears to be one source device, our ISPs link policing is forcing a 2gb flow limit. Would the best way forward be to add some sort of load balancer between devices that splits the single flow from the our device into 5 individual flows so that we can appropriately take advantage of the 2gb flow limit?

But from Layer 3 (4) and below. \n So service mesh enters the chat and addresses connectivity but at L7/HTTP. Tunnelling exists through mTLS, and Istio/Linkerd have their way of making this possible. Side-car proxies act as routers on behalf of containers pods and terminate at another side-car\n But what else does a service mesh do? - rate limit (qos) - traffic shift - load balance - filter by http request type - give us tracing and observability thanks to b3-header info (L7 traceroute) \n Of course there still needs to exist a TCP (and below) layer for all of this to happen…\n And DNS.\n So my two questions: 1.

          "description": "Hey all, hoping to get some info from PA experts from this sub.\n I am trying to understand how the self-signed certs on the Palo Alto gateway are trusted by the Global Protect client when they authenticate and sign in.\n Basically with one of our fw setups, the gateway has a cert that is self signed by the firewall itself. When we connect to the VPN, there is no ssl warning prompt for the cert being untrusted. \n I have checked that the root CA (also self signed by PA) is not present on the client machines. \n If this is the case, is there any significance of having this cert setup correctly? Does the client just accept the cert no matter the details.\n I have noticed, that when we first add the portal IP, there is a warning only initially but no warning when connecting to the gateway.\n I tried looking at docs but couldn't find what I was trying to understand here.

The company I work for has the marketing slogan \"single pane of glass\" network management but after reading through reddit feeds, this is a term people are tired of hearing.\n I'm sure most companies don't deliver on that term, making it gimicky and overused, but is there really a valid desire/need to manage through a single pane of glass? Many people I talk to are using 3-4 different vendors, so I'm wondering if it's not really a \"pain point\" to manage a bunch of different dashboards for different parts of the network or if people have just never experienced a true \"single pane of glass\" so they don't know what they're missing.\n For example, i'll hear: we're using palo alto for firewalls, mix of ubiquiti and meraki for wireless, and aruba and cisco for everything else...wouldn't that be annoying to manage all separately?\n Thankful for all thoughts and lived experiences shared!\n    submitted by    /u/CometotheJuniperside  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was wondering what you all use and have used in your campus networks for access switches, how they have been performing, what features they have, and the cost. I've been mainly using Cisco and I have found that I really just need a L2 switch with secure mgmt. If I could find a switch that just has basic L2 features and a few that might not be so common, that would be great. My access switches just provide connection to thin clients, VoIP phones, and printers, so I don't see a reason to spend money on cisco products and licenses if I can just buy something more simple. But then again I don't really know if Cisco is currently the most expensive route.\n Here's what I'm looking for in an access switch:\n -RSTP, (and MST if possible)\n -802.1q\n -LACP\n -PoE\n -SSH\n -SNMP\n Things that would be nice:\n -TACACS+ (or other encrypted mgmt aaa)\n -802.1x and or MAB support\n -HTTPS interface\n Just curious what is out there that might be cheaper. It seems like every time I put a new switch in place I just add the vlans, enable portfast for the hosts, configure username/tacacs, disable services, prune the trunk and if I'm feeling crazy double check the root bridge. I don't need VRFs, VXLANs, or GRE. I definitely don't need BGP or even OSPF lol \n Let me know what you guys use for access switches.\n (I'm currently using Cisco 9200/9300s)\n    submitted by    /u/John_Greed  \n [link]   [comments]",

The BGP peers do not like this, so they reject it in their BGP filters.\n Is there any way to workaround the above issue with IOS-XR?

          "description": "I've been trying to find a solution to a weird issue I've been having for a few days now, and this is my last hope. I've got a pair of SRX340 firewalls which I acquired in order to replace a pair of dell R330 boxes running PFSense. The goal here is to use them just for an IPsec tunnel into our GCP environment.\n As a precursor, the current PFSense boxes are in operation with one GCP tunnel each, sharing a GCP VPN gateway. When I run an iperf test over them, I can get up to 600mbps per tunnel. Plenty for what I need.\n However, when running a simple configuration in a test environment using the Google community guide for SRX devices, I'm only getting ~230mbps of possible bandwidth over the firewall. To be clear on this example, it's one SRX340 with one tunnel to GCP, dynamic routing, a gigabit WAN connection with a static IP on ge-0/0/0, and I have a laptop plugged into ge-0/0/1 on the device to run iperf3 over. Without the SRX340 in the mix, I can get 930mbps iperf3 over the internet to my test VM in GCP.\n My issue is with the 230mbps number. The SRX340 is rated for up to 733mbps of IPsec bandwidth, and I'm running the configuration given as an example in the Google guide. I just can't seem to break that speed barrier. Am I missing something or is this what I'm to expect out of an SRX340?\n    submitted by    /u/isonotlikethat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone, I've done a bit of googling about this but haven't really gotten an answer I'm happy with.\n I've been playing around with Netbox to demo, and I've been importing our addressing and VLANs. My concern is with how VLANs are handled. It seems like it's not possible to say \"vlan 1 is globally Desktops,' for example, and have all org-wide site-specific Desktop prefixes be assigned to, and appear under, the same VLAN object. Is this correct? \n Right now I have (for example) a \"site_vlans\" vlan group for multiple sites, and an individual \"vlan 1\" assigned to each group/site. This is all well and good, but suppose you have 100 VLANs and 10 sites. Are you required to maintain 1000 VLAN records in Netbox? Seems unwieldy. \n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/pythbit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Happy Friday everyone, \n So, I manage a hotel's Wifi service. A recent change I made for them was to set their QoS bandwidth cap for their free GUEST wifi network to 10Mbps. After applying the update, I went to the hotels lobbies to test it out with my laptop. Interestingly enough, I'm getting on avg. about 4-6Mbps speeds and I'm also seeing that it will fluctuate from 5Mbps, then burst to 8Mpbs, then back to 4Mbps and so on and so on. I'm assuming this is normal behavior you see when you've placed a bandwidth cap on the wifi network, but I'm not 100% on this. If not, let me know.\n When I'm on the casino floors, I'm getting correct QoS speeds (The property is a hotel & Casino), I'm also seeing burst here and there but overall speeds are right on the money.\n Currently using Cisco WLC3504 with Cisco 2802i APs.\n This might be an easy answer for some of you Wireless Cisco ninjas.

          "description": "Hello all,\n I am working in a company which develops safety-critical application. The company (railway operator) which uses our system in the field wants us to join their already deployed MPLS network. In this case, we need to share the network infrastructure with other systems like CCTV, IP phone etc. Otherwise we are going to install our closed loop for communication between control center and remote equipments, which is a general approach we have taken so far. Our concerns for sharing the common network devices with other systems are bandwidth, latency and security.\n As far as I know CCTV data is prioritized in MPLS QoS. Can our safety-critic data be prioritized higher than CCTV packets?\n Also in case of a failure in other subsystems, may a technician misconfigure the MPLS router in a troubleshooting process so that our routing configuration also be affected badly?\n I remember that with RSVP, pre-defined bandwidth can be allocated to a specific tunnel, can we rely on that?\n The good side of entering to MPLS network is that we don't need to spend a great amount of equipment cost to deploy our separate network. Also we won't need to worry for failures and maintenance.\n In case we decide to involve to MPLS network, we need some commitments from operator on bandwidth reservation and max latency we are going to experience, right?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/AdventurousComputer0  \n [link]   [comments]",

FortiGate1's ports 2 and 4 are plugged into Nexus1's ports 1 and 2. The same is done for FortiGate2.\n When I added the second Nexus, I initially tried connecting port 2 from each FortiGate into the same Nexus, and port 4 from each FortiGate into the other. However, this caused unexpected behavior. I can't exactly recall what happened, as there were a number of issues I was troubleshooting during this time.\n Fast forward a few months, I noticed Po5 was down on Nexus1, and Po4 was down on Nexus2. I removed these port channels and quickly realized this caused an outage.\n I have an opportunity for a maintenance window this weekend and would like to improve this setup if possible. Would anyone who has implemented a similar topology be willing to expand on their HA configuration?\n Many thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/FitButFluffy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Network is fairly simple with just a handful of VLAN’s, RSTP, DHCP reservations/assignments, and IGMP snooping. \n Now, onto the setup; switch (Cisco CBS-350 8 port switch in a touring enclosure) has just two VLANs active: VLAN 11 and VLAN 21, with VLAN 1 being the native VLAN as per Cisco standard. One PC on VLAN 11, and one device functioning as a ping responder on VLAN 21. \n The problem I’m having is the pc on VLAN 11 is able to ping the gateway for VLAN 21, as well as ping the device on VLAN 21 (though the ping only makes it TO the other device, it is not able to be sent back to VLAN 11). Problem only seems to arise when the PC is provided an IP with DCHP, when the PC is set to static IP in the same range I’m unable to ping the gateway of other VLANs. Feel free to ask any questions about the setup that I may not have answered, I’m sure I missed some things. TIA.\n    submitted by    /u/IShouldntGraduate  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Looking to replace a Netgear GS748Tv4H1 switch that's been in production since 2012. It has worked well (with the exception of a fan replacement a few years ago) but I recently deployed a new batch of workstations that have Intel i225/226 ethernet ports. For some unexplained reason, these computers will show \"Network disconnected\" unless I manually set the link speed to 10Mb. My troubleshooting process has narrowed it down to some issue with the Netgear switch. Anyway, management has approved a replacement switch, and I was rather hoping to find something that has at least some 2.5Gb ports as the PC's with the i225/226 ports all support that speed. Most of the cables have already been replaced with CAT6 already.\n No fancy networking scenarios here, just a single location of 40 or so mixed devices and the only requirement is LACP for the link aggregates on two Windows servers and a NAS. I will have to replace the WiFi setup as well so the 2.5Gb ports will come in handy for that and POE would be a plus but not a requirement. Having researched for the past few days I've come up with these:\n Juniper EX2300-48MP (16 x 2.5 GbE ports)\n EnGenius ECS2552FP (16 x 2.5 GbE port)\n FS S5800-48MBQ (48 x 2.5 GbE ports)\n People seem to have fairly positive things to say about the Juniper and I'm leaning that way (if I can find it in stock anywhere in Canada). However, I'm just wondering if I'm getting myself into a much more complicated situation that requires support contracts and subscriptions to cloud things and other enterprise-y stuff that I don't need. I abandoned Cisco years ago because the beancounters didn't want to pay for the yearly support contract and I couldn't get any firmware updates after that. I did have an account rep at CDW that I would go to for info but seems they're ghosting me. Am I fine just purchasing the hardware or should I really try to find a different VAR to make sure I'm getting everything I need?\n    submitted by    /u/Raquel427  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I feel like I already know the answer to this question. I was having a discussion about design with one of my bosses and I think we are in a disagreement about security best practices and practicality of implementing this type of design. \n I think its normal to have your data VLAN, voice VLAN, WiFi/Guest VLANs, IOT VLAN, server VLAN, and perhaps others as needed. I also think its normal for a lot, if not all, of this traffic to hairpin to the local firewall. This may add a very slight amount of latency, but its worth it because of the added security letting the firewall inspect, monitor, and log traffic. \n I think we have fundamental disagreements about network designs. I think hed prefer everything to be as flat as possible, but that is extremely messy. And makes troubleshooting difficult sometimes. As well as implementing changes on the fly. If data and phones are on the same subnet, you can run into QoS issues if you just start throwing on SSL inspection. \n Anyways, my point is this type of design should not be considered \"over-engineered\" for even a small to medium sized business. MAYBE a mom/pop shop with 10 employees, a DC, a file server, and a couple printers its overkill.

          "description": "Hi, sooo, yesterday I got burned really really badly on a Palo Alto pair that I'm migrating traffic across to. Long story short, it was a mistake my end, I had a NAT rule where I wanted it to NAT to the interface address of the outside interface and I had it built like this....\n Original Packet: Src Zone: Inside Dst Zone: Outside Dst Int: e1/1 Scr Address: entire 10/8 range Dst address: any\n Translated Packet: Src Translation: dynamic-ip-and-port Address-object for outside interface IP Dst address Translation: any\n The problem was, the address-object on the translated packet was what is on the outside interface, including the subnet mask of a /28!! Which royally messed everything up! I'm guessing that it was proxy-arping out for all the addresses in that range/subnet and it ended up killing our current live outbound firewalls!\n What I SHOULD have done is have another address-object that was the same address but on a /32, is that right? That's what I have now, but holy fuck am I scared to switch it back on! Even when going through a change!\n I noticed you can set it to translate to the interface address, interface and IP Address as well? Would this do the same as above when I mentioned about what I should've done instead?\n The PA NAT is definitely a different concept when coming from an ASA and Firepower world! And I lost a lot of confidence and have been pretty hard on myself ever since that happened yesterday and not seeing that!\n Would I be alright doing either of the 2 revised ways mentioned?\n The reason why I switched this particular NAT rule on was that its meant to be a catch all for PAT to the interface address, we have a large routed range that is natted to specific public IP's and they're currently live on the ASA's, so I can't enable those specific ones on the PA's yet, so I needed a way to get the outside interface working to test a few VM's in one of the lower end environments\n    submitted by    /u/Mjr798  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know it heavily depends on how many equipments are behind those, but… 🤷🏻‍♂️ - I’m starving for real life data ;-)\n And I know every network is different, but that would help me a lot if you could quote average and peak usages for those kind of networks you might have seen on 10G or even a 25G or 40G network (both North-South and East-West). \n I looked at research papers, but… I just couldn’t find anything useful.

I have been a staunch supporter of Arista in the datacenter but the 720 series just don't seem to make sense from a price to performance perspective (7 - 10k for a 24port POE switch...) . I really like Juniper's EX switches and the mist APs have been solid when I have deployed them in the past. However I am already deploying Fortinet / FortiAPs at other locations. I ideally wanted to avoid Cisco and have no experience with Aruba. I was thinking a mix of FortiGate FW \\ AP's and Juniper Switches (POE and Access) would probably work but would be curious to hear what other folks would opt for and why. Lets say for this exercise the site is 25k sqft over 4 floors with a comms room on each with structured caballing between comms rooms and to the floor ports. Cable runs for the AP's are already done. The Site will host about 100 - 150 users at peak. All you have to do is choose the hardware configure \\ install and manage it. Oh I suppose for external connectivity you could have dual DIA at the site with SD-WAN or P2P circuits to local DC locations if that makes any difference. \n ​\n  \nSwitches - Juniper EX (POE)\n Firewall - FortiGate 100 or 200f HA\n \nWireless (APs and Controller if required) - FAP-231G (FortiGate as the controller)\n  \n   submitted by    /u/apresskidougal  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all,\n In our project we use PLC to control field devices with remote IO modules. This communication between PLC and remote IOs is handled by the PLC proprietary Ethernet protocol for SIL4 (safety integrity level).\n For troubleshooting reasons, we need to analyze the packets flowing between PLC and remote IOs so we set the port mirroring option in communication module of PLC. We can see other protocol packets with their respective IO IPs (i.e NTP) or ping packets. However, we can not capture the application data packets (UDP) with Wireshark. We tried port mirroring from both COM module and managed switch (to eliminate COM module mirroring feature bug) but no chance. Neither setup could capture data packets. Managed switch we used is Ruggedcom.\n Is there any restriction/limitation in port mirroring to not mirror the proprietary protocols or something? Are there anyone used this feature in industrial Ethernet environment?\n    submitted by    /u/AdventurousComputer0  \n [link]   [comments]",

I managed to get both VMs up and running, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to get connectivity between the two devices. \n One issue is that when I built a \"network\", and drag connections to the FTD/FMC, it does not provide me any options to declare \"which\" interface I want to connect to. If I could do that, it would not matter which network I built between them, it should work. I don't need internet access from the VMs, I just want them to talk to each other. \n Now, this is not that big of an issue on the FMC, as there only seems to be one interface connected, and I have put it on the same network as the FTDv. \n But I think the core issue is.. From the look of the interfaces, both devices are using loopbacks as the interface connected to switch in EVE-NG. I don't want to change the IPs on those interfaces, for fear that I lose the ability to console into the devices, which is currently working through the EVE-NG web console.\n ​\n On both FMCv and FTDv, both eth0 interfaces are configured for the desired management network. But the Transmit/Receive statistics on these interface show they are not connected in EVE-NG. So, given I don't seem to have the ability to specify which interfaces on the VM I want to use, how on earth do I connect the two eth0 interfaces in EVE-NG?\n    submitted by    /u/youmuzzreallyhateme  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently today we run on full Cisco Hardware - C8Ks, ISR 4Ks, and Cat 3850 and 9K Switches, with no other vendor hardware deployed at our branches. Within our Datacenter we have a pair of c8500s that aggerate our WAN Connections and run as DMVPN Hubs. We run a legacy design at all our branches with MPLS running as the Primary Transport and DMVPN as the Failover if we experience LEC or provider issues on the MPLS side. With this design, we route all traffic external to the branch to our main Hub no matter the destination… Internet or On-Prem infrastructure.

Cloud service providers (CSPs) face the same challenges and appear to use fundamentally similar technologies, except that they might be more \"agile\" in adopting new tech such as the latest flavor of SDN.

Ours (Fortinet) is coming to end of support.\n We own a small commercial building with a little more than 48 ports in the building. 15 or so go to our own company, and the rest of the building is for executive suites that we rent out to tenants. One tenant may be solo, and another may be 3-4 employees. So whatever product we use needs to be able to isolate the tenants to their own secure network. Beyond this, fairly intuitive interface, good security, and any other bells and whistles that may be beneficial to an executive suites building would be great.\n All that said, they are suggesting Sonicwall. I get the sense that this is just who they've been using for a long time. They speak highly of the product they put out... but I did a little reading on a few posts and found they don't have the best reputation compared to others. Maybe in those instances it was for larger clients with different needs... I don't know these devices are a little outside my expertise :)\n Our building is pretty high end and I'd like our networking capabilities we offer to tenants to reflect that as well.

(Currently only commented via legacy DC equipment at one Datacenter only) this task wasnt completed by our senior in 3 years they had to do it and now that person is gone so I'm up.\n My thought is to connect to each DC via EBGP where my MPLS nodes are AS1 and the DC environments are AS2-5 (vPC pairs with separate AS numbers. Idk If that's good design, I didn't set it up and I don't know DC/ACI. I'd almost think each vPC pair would share an AS but have separate AS per DC.)\n Regardless, I'd set route policies to only allow DC to DC traffic to traverse the DCI and any user traffic. From DCA site to DC2 site would traverse the MPLS backbone.\n What general approach would you all take to this?

Sadly I cannot add a route to the gateway statically or with something like bgp. \n If I assign the IPs to the router, it doesn't forward the packets because they are (from the routers perspective) at the destination.\n If I use KeepaliveD to fill the ARP Cache of the Gateway and then remove the address from the interface it works until the cache gets cleared. \n The Router runs VyOS (a Debian based Firewall / Router). \n Any Ideas and Tips are welcome :)\n    submitted by    /u/pfz4  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are also using the Cloud controller (Aruba Central, on v8.10.0.6_86193, tested with latest 8.10.x as well).\n We've configured a test SSID as we have begun deploying more 6e devices. We're seeing roughly half the throughput on the 6GHz as we see on the 5GHz radio with the same clients, running speed tests and iperf to local destinations (as well as Internet Speed Test reflecting the same). We see this throughput loss across 40MHz, 80MHz and 160MHz wide channels (it scales up as you'd expect with the increased widths, but we still see ~50% loss of throughput compared to 5GHz). …",

          "description": "I have an old slingbox that tries to reach out to the internet for connection to download configuration data several times a minute. This configuration data will brick the slingbox so it is not wanted. \n I see two solutions. One is to have a packet drop rule at the firewall to drop all these packets from the slingbox. I’ve tried this and it works but I hate the excessive logging. \n The second solution is to set a dummy gateway in the slingbox gateway field. Unfortunately the device would not let me set 127.0.0.1 and I had to pick a unused ip on the lan. This works great. Nothing is logged on the firewall and I can access the device from the lan as I don’t need internet access to it. \n So my question is from a network perspective. I’m assuming the dummy gateway on the slingbox to an ip not used on the lan will create additional arp request looking for it every time the slingbox tries to connect to internet for its bad config data via that dummy gateway.\n What would have the least network impact. The dummy gateway method or using the real firewall gateway and dropping all packets to internet?\n I’m assuming the dummy gateway method would free up any logging and load on the firewall but at the expense of broadcast additional arp request looking for the unused gateway ip. \n So what’s the better solution?\n    submitted by    /u/Proudx2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone. I've run into an interesting/potentially alarming discovery at the office and I wanted some opinions. I'm primarily a SysAdmin but I do have my CCNA so I'm not entirely useless with networking. Our previous NetAdmin left ~2 years ago and we've (I've) been slowly uncovering everything that's been done here as necessary. To say it's over-complicated is an understatement (~100 subnets for a company of then 40 people, not including the /30s for OSPF PTP).\n Background: Our ISP provides us a /30 as well as a /27 that we specifically requested. The /30 subnet is terminated (is that the proper term?) on the ISP's hardware: they provided us x.x.x.124/30, the gateway is x.x.x.125 on the ISP hardware and our IP is x.x.x.126. The /27 is terminated in our hardware connected to their hardware: with block y.y.y.160/27 our hardware has y.y.y.161 and acts as the gateway. x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 are on separate VLANs routable via a VRF.\n The question: is there any benefit to using VRF in this situation? Or is there any benefit to the subnet being terminated by our hardware rather than the ISP's hardware?\n Side note/question: These IPs and the VRF are configured on a switch, not a router and/or firewall. I've further discovered that both x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 provide console access to the switch PUBLICLY. I've since closed that via access lists, but are there any other security concerns regarding this situation?\n Flaired this as routing but it could qualify as security.

When connected to a Loadmaster and looking at the statistics, I am trying to understand what the Total Conns means. Is that just a connection for an individual service, port, user connection, etc? It is a total connection over 24 hours? The ask is because I do not know why some of my numbers are so high, when the system is a test system and not heavily utilized by more than a few people, however the total connections is over 2000.\n Seems Kemp questions are pretty vague here in this sub, but I am hoping for the best.

What if a host is physically connected (through the topology that might include some switches) to the router acting as Standby?

So I guess this post is for one of two things.... has anyone done anything similar to deal with one-off bugs that would be hard to identify in a lab environment before changes, and 2.... is there a solid Cisco API that I could parse against a keyword or software function (eg: BGP, SNMP, etc) and a list of device types/versions to try and proactively identify these types of issues? I'll be using Python, but language/nuances don't matter too much as I know not everyone here is super familiar with code.... more looking for if anyone knows manual methods or data sources/api's they've leveraged in the past that I can put code to in order to make a web front end that does these checks for us prior to changes.\n Thanks for any info!\n    submitted by    /u/syntax24  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then IIRC I'd set up permissions in their account on the server.\n I've been called upon to set up a VPN for someone, and it looks like things have changed remarkably. Whn I search in order to bone up, most returns are for commercial VPN companies who are focused on providing anonymity on the web.\n Has my method of creating simple VPNs become completely outdated? I assume that security issues and methods are very different nowadays.\n Are there any good resources out there to re-learn basic VPN principles and best practices? Perhaps as I've gotten older my search capabilities have dwindled, or else I'm so hopelessly out of the loop that I don't even know what to search for within the context of small office VPNs.

I understand there is a core exam (ENCOR) which needs to be passed before undertaking a concentration exam. I have very basic scripting knowledge but like idea of network automation and hoping to spark serious interest to this area.\n I may not know enough to properly make a decision on which specialty field to take for the concentration exam, but hypothetically speaking, if I were to choose the DevNet Professional for the concentration exam, would it make more sense for me to take the DEVASC exam rather than ENCOR?\n I would likely enjoy studying for the ENCOR exam since the topics appear very important to know and interesting but because I want to strengthen network programming, the DEVASC exam look nice as well.\n Btw I’m not in a rush to get CCNP certified, it’s something I would like to study slowly in addition to working full-time.\n Open to everyone’s opinion and advice!\n    submitted by    /u/tomatoget  \n [link]   [comments]",

I haven't been able to find any method to do either from a shell script, I tried looking at how people would do it on Cisco hardware and see EEM scripts mentioned, but I don't know how to adapt them to my situation.\n I am very new to configuring routing protocols on linux and writing scripts for such purposes, sorry if this sounds like a stupid question. Thanks a bunch!\n  \nEdit: Found the solution! I'm really stupid for not noticing this earlier, but you can use vtysh -c and chain commands, just like you would use sh -c to chain and send commands to the POSIX shell from a different shell.

We would see this usually when a specific firewall model was about to fail and starts acting buggy and shortly after totally dead (needing reboots and dropping connections the weeks leading up to failure sort of thing). Seen the exact scenario at least 3 times with this hardware.\n Anyhow when the FW would have it's issues devices on the LAN would also stop working bringing, basically the entire switch is affected for locally hosted programs that typically continue to work when internet is down otherwise. We replace the FW with a new model all is fine of course, but it's alwaysbleft me confused.\n My question though is how is the L3 firewall/gateway managing to screw up a dumb switch for L2 communication? I understand while it's having issues internet may not work but this phenomenon feels like it violates everything I learned about the OSI model?? \n I can only think something with ARP getting messed up or basically FW overloading the switch and basically DoS it? \n Simple flat layout.

Cinderblock walls that are concrete filled, so signal doesn't travel well between units. Looking for suggestions on best \"cheap used enterprise\" hardware to look at. Don't have much experience with Cisco, Aruba, Arista, etc. Read dozens of threads and can't tell whats legit and what's a Ford vs Chevy thing. Tried using 30 Google WiFi routers in topology described below and it failed horribly. Tenants are mom and pop so just needing basic wifi across the building plus extensive security system cause building is in the ghetto. \n Cat6 to each unit from roof, forming wired backbone of one hard-wired AP per unit into 2-3 48 port POE switches. Add more wireless APs in each unit to form a hybrid mesh network without have to run more Cat6 everywhere. Wired backbone would also contain dozens of POE security cameras. Wired backbone would have a few switches spread geographically aross the building (left, right, center) and all connected by SPF uplinks.\n I want to avoid licensing fees and recurring costs. Ideally I can buy cheap enterprise hardware on ebay/offerup, link it all up, write a script or two for configuration (or click some buttons on a web portal) and be done. If need to expand, buy more of the same used gear then plug and play to expand the network. Don't want to worry about getting bricked out because a vendor discontinues some cloud product or because my license expired or I didn't buy from approved vendors. Also confused on the internal vs external wireless controller -- seems like sometimes thay is part of the AP and other times it is seperate?\n What brands/models do you all recommend and why? Give me a shopping list that can get it done as cheap, easy and robust as possible.

Initially, a soft reset of the device had re-established serial as well as TCP communications.\n Within hours, all of the serial devices lost communications again. Several different configuration changes were tried to no affect. A TCP/RTU testing utility was unsuccessful in establishing communications to the slaves via the Converter (failed on handshake), but the Web UI for the converters was still accessible. Soft reset did not help this time.\n Ended up changing the statically assigned IP configured on the Converter to a different address, same port (502), on the same subnet. Comms started working, everything stabilized.\n It is still working but I don't understand why.\n    submitted by    /u/murphinate  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is replicated with the second pair in another rack and then the two pairs have a 4 line LACP bond to connect them. All of this is a standalone isolated network.\n My hope for this was a complete redundancy with zero downtime, as our use case is really sensitive to that and any network downtime can cause major headaches.\n Overall this solution seems to work reasonably well and survives reboot of up to 2 devices (one of each pair) at the same time. There however often are small network down times of 1-4 seconds when one device goes down or reconnects after getting back up.\n Is this normal? I've not been able to experience these technologies on one of the more expensive brand devices, so I can't compare, but I'd generally assume bonds are meant to mitigate perceivable network down times.\n    submitted by    /u/Anteros5  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey All, \n Long time lurker, first time posting. \n I've got a bit of a situation that I thought I had a solution to, but am now stumped. Please excuse any ignorance or lack of detail. \n The scenario is, we've got a location that just had a 3rd party install a Fortigate FW needed for remote access to their devices. Said firewall needs direct internet access. Normally this vendor would use an LTE device to accomplish this, but the location is out in the boonies and service sucks, so that option is out the window. \n Our current ISP has a Ciena fiber hand off with two 1 gbe ports (will come back to why this is relevant), one of which is being used to connect to our firewall for Internet access. The demarc for this fiber circuit is in a separate building from where the 3rd party Fortigate fw is located. The two buildings are connected via mm fiber and use Brocade/Ruckus switches. \n My initial thought was to run a link from the open port in the handoff, to our switch in an access port with a newly created vlan in building one, and trunk the vlan across the network to building two where the Fortigate is located (access port again) and assign the interface on the Fortigate one of the IP's from our block. Well, that was the plan until I just got off the phone with our ISP, where the indicated that that open port is actually for an entirely new circuit that we would have to add to our account. So, I'm back to the drawing board. \n As I eluded to early, we do have a block of IP's (/29) that we can use so I'm sure there's a solution, but I'm not sure how to achieve that. While I was only the phone with the ISP, they also indicated that in order to use that block, I'd have to have a L3 device to handle the routing of said block. I don't think leadership will agree to purchasing any equipment for this as things have been extremely tight. \n Apologies if this is all over the place, it's been a hell of a day, and not just for the problem above. \n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/Iamjim1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys. My company will be having a new ISP line installed at a new site and I was shown what the IP details were by my colleague. I'm quite confused! This is my first time being involved in this sort of stuff so I'm trying to understand as much as I can.\n In our other offices we have ISP circuits where we have been given a /29 IP range and we just assign the IP of our firewalls from this range and point the default gateway to that of the ISP router so it is a lot simpler.\n Now it's LAN IPs and WAN IPs and I've no idea how they relate to our current setup which is:\n Firewall (DHCP,NAT) > L2 switch > ISP router\n I know we need a router that will point all traffic to the ISP default gateway, that much is clear. There is a /29 range for the LAN side and a /30 for the WAN side.\n The way I see it is that we have to use 2 IPs from the /29 for the firewalls and another IP for the router interface facing the firewall. Then from the /30 range another router interface (pointing to the ISP router) will be configured with an IP and then a default route will point to the ISP's default gateway.\n I think that our setup will then be:\n Firewall (DHCP,NAT) > L2 switch (ISP failover) > Router > ISP router\n Am I on the right track with this or am I completely misunderstanding?\n    submitted by    /u/hweb47  \n [link]   [comments]",

I appreciate any insight you might share.\n On my side I have 1G service delivered from Zayo into an eth port on a Nexus C93180YC-FX running NXOS 9.3(10). Zayo indicated that I should use QinQ and they're delivering the primary on VLAN A, secondary on VLAN B.\n My QinQ-fu isn't strong but at a high level my understanding is that I should be receiving S-tags A and B and using C-tag C, which is what I've configured for VLAN ID in Azure. Do I have that backwards? Microsoft's routing examples, though for IOS-XE, seem to indicate the reverse.\n I am consulting this article for configuring QinQ on the 9K.\n My issue is that all of the documentation I'm reading is around multiple inner tags with one outer tag. I believe I need the reverse. I've tried both the Configuring VLAN Mapping for Selective Q-in-Q on a 802.1Q Tunnel Port and Configuring Selective Q-in-Q with Multiple provider VLANs examples. I enter the first VLAN mapping switchport vlan mapping vlan-id-range dot1q-tunnel outer vlan-id and when I try to enter a second mapping with the same inner VLAN ID I receive an error about a conflicting mapping for the inner VLAN already existing on this port.\n Other info:\n I tried a configuration with just the primary to see if I could get BGP peering but nothing is coming up.\n interface EthernetXYZ description erc switchport mode dot1q-tunnel switchport vlan mapping C dot1q-tunnel A spanning-tree bpdufilter enable ! interface VlanC description erc no shutdown ip address 10.10.3.1/30 ! ! router bgp PRIVATEAS log-neighbor-changes neighbor 10.10.3.2 remote-as 12076 ` \n    submitted by    /u/Selcouthit  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I don't know if the fact that all the devices being configured in the same subnet would allow me to assign them to different VLANs, as far as I understand, each VLAN in a L3 switch should have a different subnet.

However the Xray machine shows a window of 50000, and the Server its communicating with shows 64240 for the window size. \n Is there a way on Server 2019 to set that window size?

          "description": "So I am trying to understand the benefit of VLANs and how they work still. Hopefully I can clearly and concisely explain my setup and confusion.\n In this example network topology, there is currently zero VLAN or network segmentation. We have one WAN feeding a Fortinet Firewall, with the Fortinet configured for DHCP relay pointing to a 2012 R2 server. This server only has one scope that all devices live in. The scope is 10.10.8.1/22 (but only handing IPs out from 10.10.8.10 - 10.10.9.248). Then the Fortinet is feeding a few miscellaneous switches that are essentially dummy switches all daisy chained together feeding them. There is zero configuration on them.\n So now I have a new HP 1920S switch I would like to integrate. And I would like to segment 36 out of the 48 ports of this switch into 3 different VLANs that cannot interact with our main 10.10.8.1/22 network. The groups being VLAN10; ports 1-12, VLAN20; ports 13-24, and VLAN30; ports 25-36, while using port 48 as a trunk for the 3 VLANs. This \"trunk\" (HP terms) is being fed into the piggybacked dummy switches. But when I test the isolation of these VLANs by plugging in two devices across two different VLAN segments, I can still ping eachother. This is where I think my lack of foundational network knowledge is hurting me...\n Even though I have 3 different VLANs configured on the switch, do I also need to create 3 different DHCP scopes to truly separate the various VLAN traffic from each other and the rest of the 10.10.8.1/22 network? If so, how do I tell the relevant VLAN traffic to be assigned to these new particular DHCP scopes? Is that done through more configuration in the HP switch, itself? I am trying to determine if I setup VLAN incorrectly and it's not behaving how it should, or it's setup correctly and my understanding isn't correct.\n I hope this makes sense.

The core network is running MPLS but they want to move the connections to the newer ASR9900 routers while they convince customers to move to ethernet and they no longer want to introduce legacy circuit types into the 9900 routers (not sure if there's any module that still supports it there) The interfaces consists of L3VPN and L2VPN doing interworking. Are there any suggestions here on what device we can possibly put in to migrate those legacy circuits into a separate box so that we just connect that box into the ASR9900 as ethernet?

The role is based on Fortinet SD-WAN/Firewalls, Ubiquiti WiFI/Switching. Company consists of a large number of sites, though the sites are small in size, so Ubiquiti makes sense for their business requirements. \n Something that is making me hesitant, is the fact that this company is using Ubiquiti WiFi/Switching & doesn't sound like there is much of a solid plan to move away from this to an enterprise solution. The cash for this role is more than what I am currently on, but I am a little concerned that by taking the role, my skills with enterprise equipment will squander, and it will be hard to move into a more enterprise role in the future. \n I use Ubiquiti equipment at home, and it is fine, but not sure I'd use it an enterprise setting. \n TLDR: If I take a role working on Ubiquiti equipment, will this tarnish my resume/skillset? \n Luppa\n    submitted by    /u/lupriana  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi r/networking!\n I'm a junior sysadmin/hobbyist working on a script and ansible suite for managing an automated lab infrastructure in a VMWare environment and am now looking for some input on E-W traffic design! (Preliminary note: As of current design, for any edge router 1-8 internal firewall 'zones' can be implemented and any one internal firewall 'zone' can be a mirrored DMZ of an internal zone. Any firewall in turn can manage 8 different portgroups connected to an arbitrary amount of hosts. All backdoor management is through an isolated private vlan.)\n In the first image I've connected the edge router to two portgroups, one for internal traffic and one for dmz traffic. Any firewall-router belonging to one of these two categories would be connected to one of these two portgroupps. https://snipboard.io/oSHWN5.jpg\n In the second image all firewall-routers have been isolated to their own portgroup, connected in turn to the edge-router. https://snipboard.io/oIU4r1.jpg\n My question is: What would be best practice with consideration of system internal traffic and separation of duties? Would you want the edge router to route internal east-west traffic if it delegated to different firewalls? Or would you want them on a shared 'uplink' portgroup and subnet and do the east-west traffic by themselves? Spontaneously I'd say that the edge-router should primarily be concerned with North-South and internal traffic is to be managed on the internal firewalls, but then again, I have little to no experience. Would these be easier to manage as well rather than muddying the waters to have the firewalls do *some* firewalling in regards to internal EW traffic and the edge router do *some* of that as well?\n I appreciate any input and thanks for reading. :)\n    submitted by    /u/manpagebob  \n [link]   [comments]",

Aruba uses Airwave, while Cisco relies on DNAC. This disparity in UIs makes it time-consuming for us to navigate and configure both platforms efficiently. \n Lack of Central Management and Monitoring: We're struggling with the absence of a centralized solution for managing and monitoring devices across both platforms. It would be ideal to have a single management system that allows us to seamlessly control and monitor both Cisco and Aruba devices.\n Single NAC Solution: We're in need of a Network Access Control (NAC) solution that is compatible with both Cisco and Aruba devices. This NAC solution should be fully functional and comply with standards such as RADIUS and TACACS+. Specifically, we're looking for features like MAC profiling for dynamic MAC registration, BYOD portals, and guest portals. Additionally, it should support both wired and wireless 802.1x authentication and provide administrative authentication for Aruba and Cisco devices.\n  \nOpen to any suggestions or recommendations that can help us address these challenges. If you have faced similar situations or successfully integrated Cisco and Aruba devices in a mixed deployment, your expertise would be greatly appreciated!\n Please share your experiences, or any solutions you might know of that could help us overcome these issues.

The peer noticed the first one wasn't sending heartbeats, so it tried to acquire the resources and tell the first one to release resources. The first one stayed online, and the result was both were stealing each other's TCP sessions, causing random session resets, until I forcibly rebooted the first LTM VE node.\n This could have been prevented if the TMOS supported either sending a 'power off the peer' command to VCSA, or if the ESXi/LTM-VE combination was capable of having a watchdog configured, where the hypervisor would reset the VM if it failed to receive any watchdog heartbeats after some period of time.\n Are either of these possible?

          "description": "Given a setup like this: snipboard.io/TrJVaH.jpg\n In the first step, let's assume two separate DSL lines going into two separate routers (VyOS machines). Both DSL lines provide public WAN IP via DHCP. VyOS boxes are configured to use NAT. On the inside VRRP is used for router redundancy.\n Now my concern is is NAT and its connection tracking. When a router handover occurs, all the connections will slowly have to time out (I believe). Is this the best that one can do?\n Now here is VRRP connection tracking sync. But I don't see how this would help since both boxes have a different WAN address. So even if all connection tracking is synced, responses from the internet will fail on handover because responses are sent to the old WAN address.\n ​\n The only way how I see this working if the internet somehow sees the same WAN for both routers. How can this work?\n Question 1: Let's assume we have no own IP network but only the two dynamically assigned WAN addresses by the two ISP. Is the sketched setup (without connection-tracking sync) the best that can be done?\n ​\n Question 2: Suppose we do have a /24 that is routed by the two ISPs. Now the public IPs are, say, 192.0.2.100 and 192.168.0.2.101 respectively. How would would one build a redundant router for an internal NAT network with that config? \n The only way I can see this working is assigning the same public IP to the VyOS machine (some sort of \"multicast\") but that's of course not permissible. Or add another box in front of the two VyOS routers that performs NAT. But then there's again a single point of failure and no point in having redundant routers behind it.\n    submitted by    /u/segdy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Okay, so I was always the guy who told everybody that SA Lifetimes should match on both sides of IPSec tunnel.\n That was until last week when I was troubleshooting periodic downtimes on a tunnel that I just moved from ASA to our new Palo Alto. Remote side is a Virtual Private Gateway in our contractor's AWS VPC.\n They were occuring at random times when rekeying Phase 2 SA.\n Sometimes the tunnel was up for two days and then suddenly dropped. Sometimes it dropped after just 3 hours. (Phase 1 - 8 Hours, Phase 2 - 1 Hour)\n The worst thing was that only Phase 2 SA went down and the AWS endpoint wasn't able to deal with that so it always meant that nothing could pass through the tunnel until the IKE SA expired or until I cleared the SAs manually.\n Finally I got some time to troubleshoot and enabled debugs on PA. I also requested logs from the guy operating the AWS infrastructure (not a networking guy).\n After I had a look at these logs, I figured out that sometimes it would occur that we started rekeying the Phase 2 SA at the same time which eventually caused the new and the old SA to get deleted on PA.\n I ended up changing the P2 SA Lifetime so it's longer than configured lifetime on the other side and I have no problems since because only one side initiates the rekey now...\n Never stop learning...\n    submitted by    /u/PatrikPiss  \n [link]   [comments]",

Power cycle did not work. I had the same IP address in both configs but ended up using the reset button after the power was back. It did the same thing when trying to update the SwOS firmware. ???\n I have a simple setup with a few workstations and a laptop. They have very fast SSDs that can copy to each other in the same workstation at around 4-5GBs and to themselves at around 1-2GBs.\n I used the /int bridge port print command and all the ports have HW hardware on.\n __________________________________\n I've looked at it a bit more and with workstation1, workstation2 and the laptop all on the same CRS305 switch. Both WS1 and the Laptop get 1.00-1.02GBs and the Windows file copy graph looks flat with only very small dips. Looks really good. But if I copy from the WS1 to the Laptop or the Laptop to WS1 I get around 400-500MBs and it's all over the place.\n WS1 and the Laptop are using Ethernet ports and Ethernet SFP modules on the CRS305 switch. WS2 has Fiber SFP modules. Not sure if that matters.\n ​\n Here is a video copying first on the laptop in the RDP window from WS2, then on WS1 from WS2.\n Then from WS1 to the Laptop and then from the laptop to WS1. The last one, laptop to WS1 is always the slowest to start, it goes up slowly.\n I just don't get how/why copying from WS2 is rock solid on both but then between WS1 and the laptop is so bad.\n All three PCs have SSDs that can read and write over 3GBs.\n File Copy Video\n    submitted by    /u/Tanquen256  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, I am looking to set up a SOHO network supporting 10GoE, which will have around 6 workstations, two NASs with dual bonded nics, printers, a WAP, and a few other network connected devices. There are times of heavy data transfers of 1TB or more and regular transfers of ~50GB+.\n I’m thinking a minimum 24-port switch, which will allow for future expansion. I’m looking for suggestions on a switch, that will probably need to be managed for possible future VLAN setup. Please let me know what you’d implement and what you’d avoid. While I will likely have the support of the IT department, this will likely be managed locally by me, with some networking (and learning more rapidly) knowledge.

          "description": "Hello,\n I recently took over a new network and we have been asked to reduce cost across the board including our SDWAN. Currently we use an MSP with Velocloud devices. We pay ~$1000/month on average per branch for the Velocloud managed-service. Most of our branches are very small ~5 users, leveraging Velocloud Edge510. We have ~20 sites.\n I have a couple of questions:\n  \nCan Velocloud devices be customer-managed? (wondering if we can save by removing managed services)\n Does anyone have good experience with any other lower cost \"branch router\" options that have simplified/central management? It doesn't have to be SDWAN necessarily but if it is SDWAN, we are looking for an SDWAN that can be customer-managed so that the cost is lower.\n  \nThanks.\n Edit:\n  \nJust found the $1000/month average was skewed by mid/large sites. My apologies for the confusion!\n The correct average cost for small sites with Velocloud Edge510 (with 30Mbps throughput) is around ~$200/month per site, this includes hardware device(s), license and managed-service (it's a bit lower for sites with a single VCE router and higher for sites with dual VCE routers).\n Based on the comments this appears to be a more reasonable cost for the small sites though it's still good to see what others are using or recommending for lower cost alternatives.

The ISE is not used as a CA, it's a client/endpoint with its own system certificate, only. It is just a node with its own publically signed SSL cert. Yet, you can litreally only choose a certificate from the trusted source certificate page, which is a page dedicated for Root/Intermediary CA certificates. So the config doesnt make sense. It's like the ISE is saying to the syslog server, Hi syslog server I am some upchain CA server, we good?\n If you read the Cisco ISE documentation in the link below, under the section heading \"Configure Secure Syslog Remote Logging Target\", it states, step 12:\n \"Choose the CA certificate that Cisco ISE must present to the secure syslog server from the Select CA Certificate drop-down list.\"\n https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-1/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_3_1/b_ISE_admin_31_basic_setup.html\n So you are forced to present a CA certificate, even though we don't use the ISE as a CA server.

          "description": "I work at a university and we have an newer outdoor athletics facility that has fiber ran to each corner of the facility. The boxes are built into the ground so that they're inconspicuous. The issue is that each winter they fill up with water, it ruins the GFI switches to the power inside and the fiber that comes into a second smaller box located inside still gets filled with water and gets dirty. They were barely able to host the event this year due to this issue but it's been a recurring problem for the 3 years the facility has been built. \n So my understanding of the setup is: fiber from a pressbox to a subterranean enclosure, fiber goes into that box into a smaller grey box that does something I don't understand, we then bring a switch that we keep inside a pelican case over and plug the fiber from the small grey box inside the subterranean enclosure into the switch, then all the necessary devices plug into the switch using ethernet. The water is getting into the small grey box and breaking things each winter.\n I don't know enough about networking to hold an eduacated converstation on the topic with you all but I just got out of a meeting with some people that presented me with a solution to this issue that I didn't like. They admitted they don't know how other places do it so we're all kinda hunting for solutions to this issue. They want something above ground but since it's an athletics facility that would require a box right on the edge of a playing field which presents competitive, asthetic and safety concerns. \n Is there a box or setup of some kind that can be left in an underground enclosure that would be able to stay dry for a number of years? I asked if there wasn't a way to cap the fiber cable coming into the subterranean enclosure with a cap that was waterproof then just bring the boxes and switches for the events each time but they said there's no cap that would keep it clean enough. \n Any thoughts or solutions would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/jmankyll  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I am trying to understand the need to have both on our network. \n Currently finishing up a network upgrade that included a lot of new things, but some of the main things were adding Cisco ISE for radius and tacacs. Another part is adding wireless to our network for the first time. Wireless is all Aruba and we are using clearpass to authorize wireless clients. APs are all Aruba, and also using AIRwave.\n So basically two AAA servers. One for wireless and one for wired. \n From my understanding, you can do wireless authentication with ISE though. ISE can authorize your wired and wireless clients, all on one device. \n Is it really necessary to have both aruba clearpass and Cisco ISE on the network? I asked my boss why have both, and his response was so we don’t have to manually enter client mac addresses, I guess they populate when the person connects to the Wi-Fi and then we can place them into the right vlan. But in my experience, ISE does the same thing with wired clients. They get placed into a dead group not associated with a vlan, and then we can assign them to a group. But usually we have them assigned before they connect. \n My issue with having two devices for aaa is having to manually enter macs in two different devices. We are a building that hosts a lot of short term guest with lots of BYOD devices. So we are always receiving lists of MAC addresses that get approved and need added into ISE. It can be a pain especially when getting calls because of connection issues then finding out it’s because someone can’t tell the difference between their wireless mac and wired Mac, plus typos and other errors. I just feel it’s unnecessary to have two devices if it can be handled by one. So just wondering if there is a bigger reason why clearpass and ISE are needed that I may be missing?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/GC_J  \n [link]   [comments]",

To my knowledge there are two ways I can go about this, see below.\n ​\n Option 1. Create the GRE tunnels and create static routes with a higher routing priority & distance which would result in the route not being active in the routing table of the Fortigate. Then create policy routes to perform the actual routing. My manager prefers to stay away from policy routes.\n Option 2. Create the GRE tunnels and create static routes with the same distance & priority. The new route will populate in the active routing table, then create firewall policies around that static route. Please see my concerns below.\n If my Fortigate firewall has a simple LAN > WAN firewall policy and the policy only includes the LAN and WAN1 interfaces and NOT the GRE tunnel inteface. If I add another 0.0.0.0/0 static route (GRE Tunnel) to my routing table with the same distance and priority. Does the Firewall start performing ECMP even though the destination interface is not included with the LAN > WAN policy?

          "description": "I'm looking into how my own ISP works. They have transit providers; wholesale downstream ethernet providers and rack space in a single datacenter from what I can see. I think it's something like this:\n Transit ISP ---> Datacenter ---> Wholesale Broadband MPLS Net ---> BRAS ---> DSLAM ---> CPE\n How does IP addressing work in a small tier 2 ISP such as this? Now this may be because of my lack of subnetting knowledge but I'm under the impression that each router interface will have a unique subnet.\n Therefore, would the subnetting look like this assuming there is no hardware redundancy (for simplicity of this example)?\n  \n Transit ---> Aggregation Switch A (/30) \n  \n Aggregation Switch ---> Core Router B (/30) \n  Core Router ---> Wholesale Ethernet MPLS C (/30) \n  Customers D (/24) Some form of NAT \n \n If anyone has a detailed diagram of an ISP that utilizes wholesale broadband MPLS I'd greatly appreciate it. Are customers generally assigned private IP addresses and then NAT is used or how does this work?\n Appreciate any advice or pointers towards resources.

They do respond to ICMP on the WAN side but do not process user traffic. No amount of troubleshooting can bring them back up working so.. we do reboot that \"fixes\" things.\n One time, second time, and today - for the third time. 50 developers can't work and ask why, what's the issue? We bought industry leading firewalls, why? \n We ran there, downloaded the logs from the devices and opened a ticket with the vendor. The answer was, for the lack of better word - shocking: \n 1) Current Firewall version XXX, we recommend to upgrade device to latest version YYY (one minor version up)\n 2) Uptime 59-60 days is really high, we recommend to reboot firewall once in 40-45 days (with a maintenance window)\n 3) TMP storage was 96% full, this happens due to long uptime of appliance\n ​\n The last time I felt this way was when some of the rookies went over to replace a switch and turned off the AC in the server room because they had no hoodies, and forgot to turn them on. On Friday evening... \n So, how often do you reboot your firewalls? :) And guess who the vendor is.\n    submitted by    /u/DarkrageLS  \n [link]   [comments]",
